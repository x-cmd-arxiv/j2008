We find that thermodynamics and radiative physics\nhave a remarkable effect on both migration and accretion of Jupiter mass\nplanets. In simulations with radiative transfer adopting flux-limited\ndiffusion, inward migration can be decreased by about 30% relative to the\nisothermal case, while in adiabatic runs migration nearly shuts off after a few\ntens of orbits. Migration varies because the relative strength of the inner and\nouter spiral perturbations is affected by thermodynamics, thus changing the net\ntorque acting on the planet. Mass accretion rates on the planet can be reduced\nby more than an order of magnitude going from isothermal to radiative transfer\nand adiabatic simulations. A circumplanetary disk always forms except in\nadiabatic runs. With radiative transfer the disk is sub-keplerian (Vrot/Vkep ~\n0.7) owing to significant pressure support.

The model consists of\nmagnetic tower jets in a galaxy cluster environment, which has been discussed\nin a series of our papers. The profile of underlying ambient gas plays an\nimportant role in jet-lobe morphology. The balance between the magnetic\npressure generated by axial current and the ambient gas pressure can determine\nthe lobe radius. The jet body is confined jointly by the external pressure and\ngravity inside the cluster core radius R_c, while outside R_c it expands\nradially to form fat lobes in a steeply decreasing ambient thermal pressure\ngradient. The current-carrying jets are responsible for generating a strong,\ntightly wound helical magnetic field. This magnetic configuration will be\nunstable against the current-driven kink mode and it visibly grows beyond R_c\nwhere a separation between the jet forward and return currents occurs. The\nreversed pinch profile of global magnetic field associated with the jet and\nlobes produces projected B-vector distributions aligned with the jet flow and\nthe lobe edge. AGN-driven shock powered by the expanding magnetic tower jet\nsurrounds the jet/lobe structure and heats the ambient ICM. The lobes expand\nsubsonically; no obvious hot spots are produced at the heads of lobes.

Reflecting distinct cell-specific\nintracellular machinery, the cancer cells are modelled as processing a variety\nof spatial search strategies that respond to these three influencing factors\nwith differential weights attached to each. While responding exclusively to\nchemoattraction optimizes cell displacement effectiveness, incorporating\npermission and resistance components becomes increasingly important with\ngreater distance to the chemoattractant source and/or after reducing the\nligand's effective diffusion coefficient. Extending this to a heterogeneous\npopulation of cells shows that displacement effectiveness increases with clonal\ndiversity as characterized by the Shannon index. However, the resulting data\ncan be fit best to an exponential function, suggesting that there is a level of\npopulation heterogeneity beyond which its added value to the cancer system\nbecomes minimal as directionality ceases to increase.

This suggests that SNe Ia are a single family of events. Similar\ncorrelations are observed between luminosity and spectral properties. In\nparticular, the ratio of the strengths of the SiII \\lambda 5972 and \\lambda\n6355 lines, known as R(SiII), was suggested as a potential luminosity\nindicator. Here, the physical reasons for the observed correlation are\ninvestigated. A Monte-Carlo code is used to construct a sequence of synthetic\nspectra resembling those of SNe with different luminosities near B maximum. The\ninfluence of abundances and of ionisation and excitation conditions on the\nsynthetic spectral features is investigated. The ratio R(SiII) depends\nssentially on the strength of SiII \\lambda 5972, because SiII \\lambda 6355 is\nsaturated. In less luminous objects, SiII \\lambda 5972 is stronger because of a\nrapidly increasing SiII/SiIII ratio. Thus, the correlation between R(SiII) and\nluminosity is the effect of ionisation balance. The SiII \\lambda 5972 line\nitself may be the best spectroscopic luminosity indicator for SNe Ia, but all\nindicators discussed show scatter which may be related to abundance\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2008 19:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}

The\nazimuthal ram pressure of the magnetized wind acting on the planet tends to\nincrease the planet's angular momentum and cause outward migration if the\nstar's rotation period $P_*$ is less than the planet's orbital period $P_p$. In\nthe opposite case, $P_* > P_p$, the planet migrates inward. Thus, planets\norbiting at distances larger (smaller) than $0.06 {\\rm AU}(P_*/5{\\rm d})^{2/3}$\ntend to be pushed outward (inward), where $P_*$ is the rotation period of the\nstar assumed to have the mass of the sun. The magnetic winds are likely to\noccur in T Tauri stars where the thermal speed of the gas close to the star is\nsmall, where the star's magnetic field is strong, and where the star rotates\nrapidly. The time-scale for appreciable radial motion of the planet is\nestimated as $\\sim 2 - 20$ Myr. A sufficiently massive close-in planet may\ncause tidal locking and once this happens the radial migration due to the\nmagnetic wind ceases.

The influence of the magnetic wind in\neroding and eventually destroying the accretion disk is analyzed.

This model is motivated by wireless\ncommunications, where individual secure messages are broadcast over open media\nand can be received by any illegitimate receiver. The secrecy level is measured\nby equivocation rate at the eavesdropper. We first study the general\n(non-degraded) broadcast channel with confidential messages. We present an\ninner bound on the secrecy capacity region for this model. The inner bound\ncoding scheme is based on a combination of random binning and the\nGelfand-Pinsker bining.

This concept would enable\nsingle-photon detection at far-IR and sub-millimeter frequencies with detector\nsensitivities that exceed that of transition-edge-sensor bolometers (TES),\nkinetic inductance detectors (KID), and superconducting tunnel junction\ndetectors (STJ). The detectors we propose are based on the single Cooper pair\nbox (SCB), a mesoscopic superconducting device that has been successfully\ndeveloped at JPL for applications in quantum computing. This concept allows for\nfrequency multiplexing of a large number of pixels using a single RF line, and\ndoes not require individual bias of each pixel. The QCD is ideal for the\nsensitive spectrographs considered for upcoming cold space telescopes, such as\nBLISS for SPICA in the coming decade, and for the more ambitious instruments\nfor the SAFIR / CALISTO and SPIRIT / SPECS missions envisioned for the 2020\ndecade. These missions require large detector arrays (> 10,000 elements) which\nare limited by astrophysical background noise, corresponding to a\nnoise-equivalent power (NEP) as low as 2x10-20 W / Hz1/2. Given its intrinsic\nresponse time, the QCD could also be used for energy-resolved visible photon\ndetection, with estimated energy resolution > 100, enabling imaging\nlow-resolution spectroscopy with an array of detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2008 22:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-27"}

Archival\ndata sets were also analyzed for comparison, which provided angular resolutions\nup to 0.3 arcseconds. A cluster of young stellar objects was detected, and a\nrich array of star forming activities was revealed. IRS 7A showed an enhanced\noutflow activity recently. The main peak of IRS 7A positionally coincides with\nan X-ray source, which suggests that the X-ray emission is directly related to\nthe central protostar. The Class 0 source SMA 2 is associated with a double\nradio source, B 9a and 9b, and seems to be driving two outflows. The B 9\ncomplex is probably a multiple-protostar system. Both B 9a and 9b are\nnonthermal radio sources with negative spectral indices. IRS 7B is a compact\nradio source surrounded by an extended structure. The compact source\ncorresponds to the Class 0/I source SMA 1, and it is also closely associated\nwith an X-ray source, suggesting that magnetic activities start early in the\nprotostellar stage of evolution. The extended structure of IRS 7B may be a\nbipolar outflow. IRS 5 was resolved into two sources with a separation of 0.9\narcseconds. Both IRS 5a and 5b display radio flares and X-ray emission,\nsuggesting that energetic magnetic processes are active in both members. The\nmonth-scale active phase of IRS 5b implies that the flare activity must involve\nlarge-scale magnetic fields. During the strong flare event of IRS 5b in 1998,\nIRS 5a also showed an enhanced level of radio emission. This concurrent\nactivity suggests that IRS 5 may be an interacting young binary system, but the\ninteraction mechanism is unknown. Alternatively, what was seen in the radio\nimages could be a circumbinary halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 04:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The results\nof KOREL disentangling of our spectra indicate that the focused stellar wind is\nresponsible for the major part of the variability of the H$\\alpha$ emission\nline.

The X-ray illuminating could also\nchange the temperature profile of the stellar wind and increase its\ntemperature, and thus decrease the H$\\alpha$ emissivity of the wind, which\ncould explain the H$\\alpha$ variabilities of Cyg X-1 during different X-ray\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 03:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is shown\nthat \\emph{quantitative} spectroscopic information can be extracted from the\nMRFM measurements. In particular, the data are extensively compared with\ncomplementary approximate models of the dynamical susceptibility: i) a 2D\nanalytical model, which assumes an homogeneous magnetization dynamics along the\nthickness and ii) a full 3D micromagnetic simulation, which assumes an\nhomogeneous magnetization dynamics below a characteristic length scale $c$ and\nwhich approximates the cylindrical sample volume by a discretized\nrepresentation with regular cubic mesh of lateral size $c=3.9$ nm. In our\nanalysis, the distortions due to a breaking of the axial symmetry are taken\ninto account, both models incorporating the possibility of a small misalignment\nbetween the applied field and the normal of the disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 06:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our goal is to characterize the nuclear bar observed in 2MASS maps\nand to study the gas dynamics in the inner Milky Way taking into account this\nsecondary bar.

Within the uncertainties, our determination of the\ngalactic spectral index is practically unaffected by the correction for\npolarization.\n  Since the overall error budget of the sky temperatures measured by TRIS at\n600 MHz, that is 66 mK(systematic)$+$18 mK (statistical), is definitely smaller\nthan those reported in previous measurements at the same frequency, our data\nhave been used to discuss the zero levels of the sky maps at 150, 408, 820 and\n1420 MHz in literature. Concerning the 408 MHz survey, limiting our attention\nto the patch of sky corresponding to the region observed by TRIS, we suggest a\ncorrection of the base-level of $(+3.9\\pm 0.6)$K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 13:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This increases the buoyant\nrising time by five orders of magnitude, therefore the number of magnetic flux\nrings participating in the mixing has to be increased correspondingly. On the\nother hand, our revised model takes advantage of the fact that the mean\nmolecular weight of the rings formed in the vicinity of the hydrogen burning\nshell has been reduced by 3He burning. This increases their thermohaline\nbuoyancy (hence, decreases the total ring number) considerably, making it\nequivalent to the pure magnetic buoyancy produced by a frozen-in toroidal field\nwith B_phi ~ 10 MG.

The behavior of the phonon-limited and surface-roughness-limited\ncomponents of the mobility was investigated by decreasing the wire width from\n30 nm to 8 nm, the width range capturing a crossover between two-dimensional\n(2D) and one-dimensional (1D) electron transport. The phonon-limited mobility,\nwhich characterizes transport at low and moderate transverse fields, is found\nto decrease with decreasing wire width due to an increase in the\nelectron-phonon wavefunction overlap. In contrast, the mobility at very high\ntransverse fields, which is limited by surface roughness scattering, increases\nwith decreasing wire width due to volume inversion. The importance of acoustic\nphonon confinement is also discussed briefly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 15:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

This paper discusses how to obtain\nanalytical results which are in qualitative agreement with these lattice data\nwithin the Gribov-Zwanziger framework. This framework allows one to take into\naccount effects related to the existence of gauge copies, by restricting the\ndomain of integration in the path integral to the Gribov region. We elaborate\nto great extent on a previous short paper by presenting additional results,\nalso confirmed by the numerical simulations.

The\ncomputations proceeds via the computation of the Euclidean Green's function for\nthe gauge, Higgs and Faddeev-Popov fields using mode functions, and taking the\nappropriate trace. Renormalization is an essential part of this computation, it\nis done by removing leading order contributions from the numerical results so\nas to make these finite, and to add the divergent parts back, after suitable\nregularization and renormalization. We encounter and solve some problems which\nare specific to gauge theories and topological solutions. The corrections to\nthe energy are found to be sizeable, but still smaller than the classical\nenergy as long as g**2 is smaller than unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 15:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}
