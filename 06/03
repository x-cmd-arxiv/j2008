We consider a special family of examples with a\nsingle nonvanishing Yukawa coupling in the large complex structure limit, which\nallows us to study all possible stable vacua of the tree-level no-scale\npotential very explicitly. We find that, by tuning fluxes, both supersymmetric\nand nonsupersymmetric vacua can be realized at almost any point in the large\ncomplex structure moduli space of one-, two-, and three-parameter models. We\nalso consider the effects of stringy corrections on tree-level vacua. We argue\nquite generally that, in certain regimes, both supersymmetric and\nnonsupersymmetric tree-level vacua could serve as consistent, controllable\nfoundations for full stabilization beyond tree level (including Kahler moduli),\nleading to either AdS or dS cosmological constants. We show how to achieve\nthese regimes in our models.

For\nexample, it could cause an explosive release of the energy of a cloud of\nultrarelativistic protons into radiation. More certainly, supercriticality\nshould be responsible for energy dissipation of very energetic relativistic\nfluids such as ultrarelativistic shocks in gamma-ray bursts and jets in active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs). In this case, the photon breeding process operates. It\nis a kind of the converter mechanism with the high-energy photons and e^+ e^-\npairs converting into each other via pair production and inverse Compton\nscattering. Under certain conditions, which should be satisfied in powerful\nAGNs, the photon breeding mechanism becomes supercritical: the high-energy\nphotons breed exponentially until their feedback on the fluid changes its\nvelocity pattern. Then the system comes to a self-adjusting near-critical\nsteady state. Monte-Carlo simulations with the detailed treatment of particle\npropagation and interactions demonstrate that a jet with the Lorentz factor\nGamma ~ 20 can radiate away up to a half of its total energy and for Gamma=40\nthe radiation efficiency can be up to 80 per cent. Outer layers of the jet\ndecelerate down to a moderate Lorentz factor 2-4, while the spine of the jet\nhas the final Lorentz factor in the range 10-20 independently on the initial\nGamma. Such sharp deceleration under the impact of radiation must cause a\nnumber of interesting phenomena such as formation of internal shocks and an\nearly generation of turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 16:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

The exponential growth of the energy\ndensity of these photons is a super-critical process powered by the bulk energy\nof the jet. The efficient deceleration of the jet outer layers creates a\nstructured jet morphology with the fast spine and slow sheath. In initially\nfast and high-power jets even the spine can be decelerated efficiently leading\nto very high radiative efficiencies of conversion of the jet bulk energy into\nradiation. The decelerating, structured jets have angular distribution of\nradiation significantly broader than that predicted by a simple blob model with\na constant Lorentz factor. This reconciles the discrepancy between the high\nDoppler factors determined by the fits to the spectra of TeV blazars and the\nlow apparent velocities observed at VLBI scales as well as the low jet Lorentz\nfactors required by the observed statistics and luminosity ratio of\nFanaroff-Riley I radio galaxies and BL Lac objects.

In the first part we explain how the study of\nthe probability density function (pdf) of the fluctuations of total energy is\nrelated to the characterization of velocity correlations. Two different regimes\nare addressed: the gas driven at the boundaries and the homogeneously driven\ngas. In a granular gas, due to non-Gaussianity of the velocity pdf or lack of\nhomogeneity in hydrodynamics profiles, even in the absence of velocity\ncorrelations, the fluctuations of total energy are non-trivial and may lead to\nerroneous conclusions about the role of correlations. In the second part of the\nchapter we take into consideration the fluctuations of injected power in driven\ngranular gas models. Recently, real and numerical experiments have been\ninterpreted as evidence that the fluctuations of power injection seem to\nsatisfy the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Relation. We will discuss an\nalternative interpretation of such results which invalidates the\nGallavotti-Cohen symmetry. Moreover, starting from the Liouville equation and\nusing techniques from large deviation theory, the general validity of a\nFluctuation Relation for power injection in driven granular gases is\nquestioned. Finally a functional is defined using the Lebowitz-Spohn approach\nfor Markov processes applied to the linear inelastic Boltzmann equation\nrelevant to describe the motion of a tracer particle. Such a functional results\nto be different from injected power and to satisfy a Fluctuation Relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 17:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-12"}

This bound is a Yang--Mills analog of the Pomeranchuk\nbound in classical electrodynamics, where it is a consequence of radiation in a\nstrong external field acting on a relativistic charge. Since as a result the\nmassive constituent partons are slowed down to a velocity v < c, the angular\ndistribution of the emitted radiation exhibits a broad \"dead cone\". If the\nproperties of conformal and QCD matter at strong coupling are qualitatively\nsimilar, the existence of this universal upper bound would have dramatic\nimplications for heavy ion experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 18:56:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2008 20:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-04"}

The Lagrangian is the sum a mechanical one and of a\nmagnetic one. This magnetic Lagrangian is expressed in terms of rotor angle,\ncomplex stator and rotor currents. A complexification procedure widely used in\nquantum electrodynamic is applied here in order to derive the Euler-Lagrange\nequations with complex stator and rotor currents. Such complexification process\navoids the usual separation into real and imaginary parts and simplifies\nnotably the calculations. Via simple modifications of such magnetic Lagrangians\nwe derive new dynamical models describing permanent-magnet machines with both\nsaturation and saliency, and induction machines with both magnetic saturation\nand space harmonics. For each model we also provide its Hamiltonian thus its\nmagnetic energy. This energy is also expressed with complex currents and can be\ndirectly used in Lyapunov and/or passivity based control. Further, we briefly\ninvestigate the observability of this class of Euler-Lagrange models, in the\nso-called sensorless case when the measured output is the stator current and\nthe load torque is constant but unknown. For all the dynamical models obtained\nvia such variational principles, we prove that their linear tangent systems are\nunobservable around a one-dimensional family of steady-states attached to the\nsame constant stator voltage and current. This negative result explains why\nsensorless control of three-phase electrical machines around zero stator\nfrequency remains yet a difficult control problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2008 05:58:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2008 12:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 10:40:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2009 08:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The main reason behind such a plausibility is that the\nwell-known Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area proportionality -- the so-called\n`area law' of black hole physics -- holds for entanglement entropy as well,\nprovided the scalar field is in its ground state, or in other minimum\nuncertainty states, such as a generic coherent state or squeezed state.\nHowever, when the field is either in an excited state or in a state which is a\nsuperposition of ground and excited states, a power-law correction to the area\nlaw is shown to exist. Such a correction term falls off with increasing area,\nso that eventually the area law is recovered for large enough horizon area. On\nascertaining the location of the microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to\nthe entanglement entropy of black holes, it is found that although the degrees\nof freedom close to the horizon contribute most to the total entropy, the\ncontributions from those that are far from the horizon are more significant for\nexcited/superposed states than for the ground state. Thus, the deviations from\nthe area law for excited/superposed states may, in a way, be attributed to the\nfar-away degrees of freedom. Finally, taking the scalar field (which is traced\nover) to be massive, we explore the changes on the area law due to the mass.\nAlthough most of our computations are done in flat space-time with a\nhypothetical spherical region, considered to be the analogue of the horizon, we\nshow that our results hold as well in curved space-times representing static\nasymptotically flat spherical black holes with single horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 22:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-28"}

The penumbral outer boundary moves\ninward when granules appear in the outer penumbra. We discover that such\ngranules appear one after another while moving magnetic features (MMFs) are\nseparating from the penumbral ``spines'' (penumbral features that have stronger\nand more vertical fields than those of their surroundings). These granules that\nappear in the outer penumbra often merge with bright features inside the\npenumbra that move with the spines as they elongate toward the moat region.\nThis suggests that convective motions around the penumbral outer boundary are\nrelated to the disintegration of magnetic flux in the sunspot. We also find\nthat dark penumbral filaments frequently elongate into the moat region in the\nvicinity of MMFs that detach from penumbral spines. Such elongating dark\npenumbral filaments correspond to nearly horizontal fields extending from the\npenumbra. Pairs of MMFs with positive and negative polarities are sometimes\nobserved along the elongating dark penumbral filaments. This strongly supports\nthe notion that such elongating dark penumbral filaments have magnetic fields\nwith a ``sea serpent''-like structure.

J/psi suppression\nmechanisms based on energy density (such as color screening, interaction with\nco-movers, etc.) predict the opposite trend. On the other hand, it is expected\nthat more c\\bar{c} pairs should be available to form quarkonia at mid-rapidity\nvia recombination. Some models provide a way to differentiate J/psi production\nfrom initially produced c\\bar{c} pairs and final state recombination of\nuncorrelated pairs, via the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the\nelliptic flow (v2).\n  During 2007 data taking at RHIC, a large sample of Au+Au collisions at\nsqrt(sNN)=200 GeV was collected. The statistics has been increased compared to\nprevious 2004 data set, thus allowing a more precise measurement of the J/psi\nproduction at both mid and forward rapidity.

Many YSOs are formed from dense\nprestellar cores embedded in filaments, and therefore the relative orientations\nof outflows and filaments may place useful constraints on the dynamics of core\nformation.\n  Aims: We explore this possibility, from the viewpoint of what it may tell us\nabout the angular momentum delivered to a core forming in a filament. We stress\nthat we are not here addressing the issue of the relationship of filaments and\noutflows to the prevailing magnetic field direction, although this is evidently\nalso an interesting issue.\n  Results: Using the limited data available, and neglecting any possible\nselection effects or correlations between nearby outflows, we infer that the\nobserved outflows have a tendency to be orthogonal to the filaments that\ncontain their driving sources. Specfically, in the cases where the directions\nof the filaments and outflows are well defined, we infer statistically that 72%\nof outflows are within $45^{\\rm o}$ of being orthogonal to the filament, and\nonly 28% are within $45^{\\rm o}$ of being parallel to the filament.\n  Conclusions: This suggests that the prestellar cores which spawned the YSOs\ndriving the observed outflows had angular momenta which were approximately\northogonal to the filaments out of which the cores formed.

Upcoming data from, e.g., the SNLS (Supernova Legacy Survey)\nand the SDSS-II (SDSS: Sloan Digital Sky Survey) supernova searches will\nimprove our limits on the size of - or possibly detect - possible correlations\nalso at high redshift at the per cent level in the near future. With data from\nthe proposed SNAP (SuperNova Acceleration Probe) satellite, we will be able to\ndetect the induced correlations from gravitational lensing on type Ia peak\nmagnitudes on scales less than a degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2008 11:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 17:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

Mass-loss rates for 10 intermediate- to high-mass-loss-rate AGB stars\nare derived using a detailed non-LTE, non-local radiative transfer code based\non the Monte-Carlo method to model the CO radio line intensities. The\ncircumstellar envelopes are assumed to be spherically symmetric and formed by\nconstant mass-loss rates. The energy balance is solved self-consistently and\nthe effects of dust on the radiation field and thermal balance are included. An\nindependent estimate of the mass-loss rate is also obtained from the\ncombination of dust radiative transfer modelling with a dynamical model of the\ngas and dust particles. We find that the CO radio line intensities and shapes\nare successfully reproduced for the majority of our objects assuming a constant\nmass-loss rate. Moreover, the CO line intensities are only weakly dependent on\nthe adopted micro-turbulent velocity, in contrast to recent claims in the\nliterature. The two methods used in the present work to derive mass-loss-rates\nare consistent within a factor of ~3 for intermediate- to high-mass-loss-rate\nobjects, indicating that this is a lower limit to the uncertainty in present\nmass-loss-rate estimates. We find a tentative trend with chemistry.

In literature, various\ntechniques have been presented, but no general consensus about their real\nperformances and properties has been reached. This is due to the\ncharacteristics of these techniques that have been studied essentially through\nnumerical simulations based on semi-empirical models of the CMB and the\nGalactic foregrounds. Such models often have different level of sophistication\nand/or are based on different physical assumptions (e.g., the number of the\nGalactic components and the level of the noise). Hence, a reliable comparison\nis difficult. What actually is missing is a statistical analysis of the\nproperties of the proposed methodologies. Here, we consider the \"Internal\nLinear Combination\" method (ILC) which, among the separation techniques,\nrequires the smallest number of \"a priori\" assumptions. This feature is of\nparticular interest in the context of the CMB polarization measurements at\nsmall angular scales where the lack of knowledge of the polarized backgrounds\nrepresents a serious limit. METHODS: The statistical characteristics of ILC are\nexamined through an analytical approach and the basic conditions are fixed in a\nway to work satisfactorily. RESULTS: ILC provides satisfactory results only\nunder rather restrictive conditions. This is a critical fact to take into\nconsideration in planning the future ground-based observations (e.g., with\nALMA) where, contrary to the satellite experiments, there is the possibility to\nhave a certain control of the experimental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2008 12:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

SARAH just needs the gauge structure, particle content and\nsuperpotential to produce all information about the gauge eigenstates of a\nmodel. Breaking of gauge symmetries and mixings of particles can easily be in a\nsecond step and entire Lagrangian is derived automatically. Also the gauge\nfixing terms are derived by SARAH in R_Xi gauge, and the corresponding ghost\ninteractions are calculated. Using this information, SARAH can calculate the\nall mass matrices, tadpole equations and vertices at tree-level for the given\nmodel. In addition, the expressions for the 1- and 2-loop renormalization group\nequations of all parameters can be calculated and an automatic calculation for\nthe 1-loop corrections to self energies and the tadpoles are possible.\n  SARAH can write all information about the model to LaTeX files, or create a\nmodel files for FeynArts/FormCalc, WHIZARD/OMEGA and CalcHep/CompHep, which can\nalso be used for dark matter studies using MicrOmegas, and in the UFO format\nwhich is supported by MadGraph 5. Beginning with version 3, SARAH is also the\nfirst available spectrum-generator-generator: based on the derived, analytical\nexpression it creates source code for SPheno to calculate the mass spectrum as\nwell the SUSY decays with high precision. In that way, it is possible to\nimplement new models in SPheno without the need to write any Fortran code by\nhand.

We propose for instance to use a restrained shrinkage ring test to\nidentify a basic early age creep model based on a simple ageing visco-elastic\nKelvin model. The strain data obtained from this test can be treated through an\nearly age finite element incremental procedure such that the fitting parameters\nof the creep law can be quickly identified. The others properties of concrete\nhave been measured at different ages (elastic properties, hydration kinetics,\nand coefficient of thermal expansion). From the identified early age model, we\ncomputed the temperature rise and the stress development in a non reinforced\nconcrete stress for nuclear waste.
