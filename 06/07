We show\nthat the impact of a small local primordial non-gaussianity (generated on\nsuper-horizon scales) on the statistics of collapsed objects (such as galaxies\nor clusters) can be approximated by using slightly modified, but gaussian,\ninitial conditions, which we describe through simple analytic expressions.\nGiven that numerical simulations with gaussian initial conditions are\nrelatively well-studied, this equivalence provides us with a simple tool to\npredict signatures of primordial non-gaussianity in the statistics of collapsed\nobjects. In particular, we describe the predictions for non-gaussian mass\nfunction, and also confirm the recent discovery of a non-local bias on large\nscales (arXiv:0710.4560, arXiv:0801.4826) as a signature of primordial\nnon-gaussianity.

Three variational parameters are considered,\ncorresponding to the effective coherence length of the vortex, the effective\npenetration length for the Meissner currents, and the value of the order\nparameter at the surface. The results show that the last two variational\nparameters are independent of vortex position. Explicit calculations are\npresented for several $\\kappa$ values.

This decay is either produced by the rapidly\ndeclining continuation of the central engine activity or by some left-over\nradiation starting right after the central engine shuts off. The latter\nscenario consists of the emission from an \"ember\" that cools via adiabatic\nexpansion and, if the jet angle is larger than the inverse of the source\nLorentz factor, the large angle emission. In this work, we calculate the\ntemporal and spectral properties of the emission from such a cooling ember,\nproviding a new treatment for the micro-physics of the adiabatic expansion. We\nuse the adiabatic invariance of p_{\\perp}^2/B (p_{\\perp} is the component of\nthe electrons' momentum normal to the magnetic field, B) to calculate the\nelectrons' Lorentz factor during the adiabatic expansion; the electron momentum\nbecomes more and more aligned with the local magnetic field as the expansion\ndevelops. We compare the theoretical expectations of the adiabatic expansion\n(and the large angle emission) with the current observations of the early x-ray\ndata and find that only about 20% of our sample of 107 bursts is potentially\nconsistent with this model. This leads us to believe that, for most bursts, the\ncentral engine does not turn off completely during the steep decay of the x-ray\nlight curve; therefore, this phase is produced by the continued rapidly\ndeclining activity of the central engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2008 20:07:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 19:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-17"}

This effect is more\npronounced for samples with steep and strongly evolving parent LFs but is still\npresent even for non-evolving LFs. As a result of this distortion of the true\nLF, fitting a model LF to binned data may lead to errors in the estimation of\nthe parameters and may even prompt the erroneous use of broken power law\nfunctions. We compute the expected positions of apparent breaks in the binned\nLF. We show that these spurious breaks in the binned LFs can be avoided if the\nbinning is done in the flux--redshift plane instead of the typically used\nluminosity--redshift plane. Binning in the flux--redshift plane can be used in\nconjunction with the binning in the luminosity--redshift plane to test for real\nbreaks in the binned LFs and to identify the features that are the result of\nbinning biases. We illustrate this effect for most typical forms of luminosity\ndependence and redshift evolution and show how the proposed method helps\naddress this problem.

Two cases were considered: direct circulation provided by a rim\nheater at the periphery and indirect circulation provided by a central heater.\nThe detailed 3D structure of the mean large-scale velocity field is\nreconstructed using the PIV technique. Due to the action of the Coriolis force\nthe meridional flow results in differential rotation. Differential rotation is\ncharacterized by the mean values of radial and vertical gradients of azimuthal\nvelocity. Strong negative mean radial gradient which grows with the Grasshoff\nnumber is provided by direct circulation. In the case of indirect circulation a\npronounced negative gradient arises at moderate Grashoff number. The behavior\nof the mean vertical gradient is quite different: a positive vertical gradient\ngrows logarithmically with Grasshoff number under direct circulation, whereas a\nweak negative gradient characterizes the indirect circulation. This difference\nfollows from the structure of the flow -- the direct circulation provides a\nlarge cyclonic area localized above the anticyclonic flow, while indirect\ncirculation leads to a strong separation of these two areas in the radial\ndirection (the central part is occupied by the cyclonic flow and the periphery\nby the anticyclonic flow). Meridional circulation leads to substantial\nvariation of the integral angular momentum. Direct circulation results in the\ngrowth of the integral angular momentum and indirect circulation causes it to\ndecrease. At the same heating power, the increase of angular momentum at direct\ncirculation is much stronger than its decrease at indirect circulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2008 04:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-10"}

The functional ecdysone\nreceptor is a heterodimer of ECR (NR1H1) and USP-RXR (NR2B4), which is the\northologue of vertebrate retinoid X receptors (RXR alpha, beta, gamma). Both\nproteins belong to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors,\nligand-dependent transcription factors that share two conserved domains: the\nDNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD). In order to gain\nfurther insight into the evolution of metamorphosis and gene regulation by\necdysone in arthropods, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of both partners\nof the heterodimer ECR/USP-RXR. Overall, 38 USP-RXR and 19 ECR protein\nsequences, from 33 species, have been used for this analysis. Interestingly,\nsequence alignments and structural comparisons reveal high divergence rates,\nfor both ECR and USP-RXR, specifically among Diptera and Lepidoptera. The most\nimpressive differences affect the ligand-binding domain of USP-RXR. In\naddition, ECR sequences show variability in other domains, namely the\nDNA-binding and the carboxy-terminal F domains. Our data provide the first\nevidence that ECR and USP-RXR may have coevolved during holometabolous insect\ndiversification, leading to a functional divergence of the ecdysone receptor.\nThese results have general implications on fundamental aspects of insect\ndevelopment, evolution of nuclear receptors, and the design of specific\ninsecticides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2008 06:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Here, we present systematic analysis of the\nlightcurve characteristics from X-ray to gamma-ray energy bands for the two\nprototypical LL-GRBs 980425 and 060218. It is found that both the pulse width\n($w$) and the ratio of the rising width to the decaying width ($r/d$) of theses\ntwo bursts are energy-dependent over a broad energy band. There exists a\nsignificant trend that the pulses tend to be narrower and more symmetry with\nrespect to the higher energy bands for the two events. Both the X-rays and the\ngamma-rays follow the same $w - E$ and $r/d - E$ relations. These facts may\nindicate that the X-ray emission tracks the gamma-ray emission and both are\nlikely to be originated from the same physical mechanism. Their light curves\nshow significant spectral lags. We calculate the three types of lags with the\npulse peaking time ($t_{peak}$), the pulse centroid time ($t_{cen}$), and the\ncross-correlation function (CCF). The derived $t_{peak}$ and $t_{cen}$ are a\npower-law function of energy. The lag calculated by CCF is strongly correlated\nwith that derived from $t_{peak}$. But the lag derived from $t_{cen}$ is less\ncorrelated with that derived from $t_{peak}$ and CCF. The energy dependence of\nthe lags is shallower at higher energy bands. These characteristics are well\nconsistent with that observed in typical long-lag, wide-pulse GRBs, suggesting\nthat GRBs 980425 and 060218 may share the similar radiation physics with them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2008 12:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
