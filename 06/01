We develop a cluster-correlation\nexpansion (CCE) theory for the spin bath dynamics relevant to the qubit\ndecoherence problem. A cluster correlation term is recursively defined as the\nevolution of a group of bath spins divided by the cluster correlations of all\nthe subgroups. The so-defined correlation accounts for the authentic collective\nexcitations within a given group. The bath propagator is the product of all\npossible cluster correlation terms. For a finite-time evolution as in the qubit\ndecoherence problem, a convergent result can be obtained by truncating the\nexpansion up to a certain cluster size. The two-spin cluster truncation of the\nCCE corresponds to the pair-correlation approximation [PRB 74,195301(2006)]. In\nterms of the standard linked cluster expansion, a cluster correlation term is\nthe infinite summation of all the connected diagrams with all and only the\nspins in the group flip-flopped, and thus the expansion is exact whenever\nconverges. When the individual contribution of each higher-order correlation\nterm to the decoherence is small, as the usual case for relatively large baths\nwhere the decoherence could complete well within the bath spin flip-flop time,\nthe CCE coincides with the cluster expansion [PRB 74,035322(2006)]. For small\nbaths, however, the qubit decoherence may not complete within the bath spin\nflip-flop timescale and thus individual higher-order cluster correlations could\ngrow significant. In such cases, only the CCE converges to the exact coherent\ndynamics of multi-spin clusters. We check the accuracy of the CCE in an exactly\nsolvable spin-chain model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 May 2008 17:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-25"}

The magnetic field acts as a reservoir of\nenergy and can dissipate its energy to thermal and kinetic energy via the\ntearing mode instability. We have performed 3d nonlinear MHD simulations of the\ntearing mode instability in a current sheet. Results from a temporal stability\nanalysis in both the linear regime and weakly nonlinear (Rutherford) regime are\ncompared to the numerical simulations. We observe magnetic island formation,\nisland merging and oscillation once the instability has saturated. The growth\nin the linear regime is exponential in agreement with linear theory. In the\nsecond, Rutherford regime the island width grows linearly with time. We find\nthat thermal energy produced in the current sheet strongly dominates the\nkinetic energy. Finally preliminary analysis indicates a P(k) 4.8 power law for\nthe power spectral density which suggests that the tearing mode vortices play a\nrole in setting up an energy cascade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jun 2008 13:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-24"}

However, it\nwas recently discovered that the sparsity pattern of the Lasso estimator can\nonly be asymptotically identical to the true sparsity pattern if the design\nmatrix satisfies the so-called irrepresentable condition. The latter condition\ncan easily be violated in the presence of highly correlated variables. Here we\nexamine the behavior of the Lasso estimators if the irrepresentable condition\nis relaxed. Even though the Lasso cannot recover the correct sparsity pattern,\nwe show that the estimator is still consistent in the $\\ell_2$-norm sense for\nfixed designs under conditions on (a) the number $s_n$ of nonzero components of\nthe vector $\\beta_n$ and (b) the minimal singular values of design matrices\nthat are induced by selecting small subsets of variables. Furthermore, a rate\nof convergence result is obtained on the $\\ell_2$ error with an appropriate\nchoice of the smoothing parameter. The rate is shown to be optimal under the\ncondition of bounded maximal and minimal sparse eigenvalues. Our results imply\nthat, with high probability, all important variables are selected. The set of\nselected variables is a meaningful reduction on the original set of variables.\nFinally, our results are illustrated with the detection of closely adjacent\nfrequencies, a problem encountered in astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jun 2008 13:46:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 14:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-02"}
