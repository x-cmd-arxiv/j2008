The voltage induces transitions when the ac frequency equals n times\nthe splitting between the ground and first excited quasi-bound state of the\njunction. We calculate the transition matrix elements as functions of the dc\nbias current I, and the frequency and amplitude of the ac voltage, for\nrepresentative junction parameters. We also calculate the frequency-dependent\nabsorption coefficient by solving the relevant Bloch equations when the ac\namplitude is sufficiently small. In this regime, the absorption coefficient is\na sum of Lorentzian lines centered at the n-photon absorption frequency, of\nstrength proportional to the squared matrix elements. For fixed ac voltage\namplitude, the n-photon transition rate usually decreases with increasing n.

In this paper we\ncarefully investigate the model and find that the scattered emission undergoes\nstrong spectral softening with time, due to the model's essential ingredient\nthat harder X-ray photons have smaller scattering angle thus arrive earlier,\nwhile softer photons suffer larger angle scattering and arrive later. The model\npredicts a significant change, i.e., $\\Delta \\b \\sim 2 - 3$, in the X-ray\nspectral index from the beginning of the plateau toward the end of the plateau,\nwhile the observed data shows close to zero softening during the plateau and\nthe plateau-to-normal transition phase. The scattering model predicts a big\ndifference between the harder X-ray light curve and the softer X-ray light\ncurve, i.e., the plateau in harder X-rays ends much earlier than in softer\nX-rays. This feature is not seen in the data. The large scattering optical\ndepths of the dust required by the model imply strong extinction in optical,\n$A_V \\gtrsim $ 10, which contradicts current findings of $A_V= 0.1 - 0.7$ from\noptical and X-ray afterglow observations.

ZC\n(ZeroCollision) is neither reservation-based nor dynamic TDMA; the protocol\nsupports variable-length packets and does not lose efficiency when some of the\nstations do not transmit. At the same time, ZC is not a CSMA; in its steady\nstate, it is completely collision-free. The stations transmit repeatedly in a\nround-robin order once the convergence state is reached. If some stations skip\ntheir turn, their transmissions are replaced by idle $20 \\mu$-second mini-slots\nthat enable the other stations to keep track of their order. Because of its\nshort medium access delay and its efficiency, the protocol supports both\nreal-time and elastic applications. The protocol allows for nodes leaving and\njoining the network; it can allocate more throughput to specific nodes (such as\nan access point). The protocol is robust against carrier sensing errors or\nclock drift. While collision avoidance is guaranteed in a single collision\ndomain, it is not the case in a multiple collision one. However, experiments\nshow ZC supports a comparable amount of goodput to CSMA in a multiple collision\ndomain environment. The paper presents an analysis and extensive simulations of\nthe protocol, confirming that ZC outperforms both CSMA and TDMA at high and low\nload.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jun 2008 03:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-16"}

The\nvertex operators for the octet of gluons are constructed by the procedure of\n``photon painting'', that is, with the SU(3) subgroup of the $\\alpha$-symmetry\ngenerators acting on a regular open string photon, so the corresponding open\nstring excitations are in the adjoint of SU(3). Remarkably, the operator\nalgebra of these massless gluon vertices is closed and possesses the full\nzigzag symmetry, crucial for the isomorphism between open strings and QCD. As a\nresult, the scattering amplitudes of the constructed open string vertex\noperators have a field-theoretic rather than a stringy structure, including the\nabsense of standard tower of massive intermediate states.Our model also\nsuggests that the total number of underlying hidden dimensions is three, with\neach extra dimension carrying its appropriate SU(3) colour and anticolour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jun 2008 13:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-09"}

In such a comparison it is of crucial importance to employ\ncorresponding boundary conditions both in the particle and in the continuum\ncalculations. Here, we formulate the continuum problem in a way that makes it\nanalogous to the electrostatics problem of finding the potential of a point\ncharge in periodic boundary conditions. The continuum calculations can then be\ncarried out using the technique of Ewald summation. For interstitials, the\ndisplacement fields predicted by elasticity theory are accurate at large\ndistances, but large deviations occur near the defect for distances of up to 10\nlattice spacings.
