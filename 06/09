Using the method, the feasibility of recovering SFHs with multi-band\nphotometry is investigated. The method divides a galaxy's history into discrete\ntime intervals and reconstructs the average rate of star formation in each\ninterval. This directly gives the total stellar mass. A simple linear inversion\nsolves the problem of finding the most likely discretised SFH for a given set\nof galaxy parameters. It is shown how formulating the method within a Bayesian\nframework lets the data simultaneously select the optimal regularisation\nstrength and the most appropriate number of discrete time intervals for the\nreconstructed SFH. The method is demonstrated by applying it to mono-metallic\nsynthetic photometric catalogues created with different input SFHs, assessing\nhow the accuracy of the recovered SFHs and stellar masses depend on the\nphotometric passband set, signal-to-noise and redshift. The results show that\nreconstruction of SFHs using multi-band photometry is possible, being able to\ndistinguish an early burst of star formation from a late one, provided an\nappropriate passband set is used. Although the resolution of the recovered SFHs\nis on average inferior compared to what can be achieved with spectroscopic\ndata, the multi-band approach can process a significantly larger number of\ngalaxies per unit exposure time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2008 10:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In Indiana,\nhighway-related accidents result in about 900 fatalities and forty thousand\ninjuries annually and place an incredible social and economic burden on the\nstate. Still, speed limits posted on highways and other roads are routinely\nexceeded as individual drivers try to balance safety, mobility (speed), and the\nrisks and penalties associated with law enforcement efforts. The\nspeed-limit/safety issue has been a matter of considerable concern in Indiana\nsince the state raised its speed limits on rural interstates and selected\nmultilane highways on July 1, 2005. In this paper, the influence of the posted\nspeed limit on the severity of vehicle accidents is studied using Indiana\naccident data from 2004 (the year before speed limits were raised) and 2006\n(the year after speed limits were raised on rural interstates and some\nmulti-lane non-interstate routes). Statistical models of the injury severity of\ndifferent types of accidents on various roadway classes were estimated. The\nresults of the model estimations showed that, for the speed limit ranges\ncurrently used, speed limits did not have a statistically significant effect on\nthe severity of accidents on interstate highways. However, for some\nnon-interstate highways, higher speed limits were found to be associated with\nhigher accident severities - suggesting that future speed limit changes, on\nnon-interstate highways in particular, need to be carefully assessed on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2008 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-02"}

A generalization of these results to geometric surface\nflows is presented, where the surfaces are non-stretching in one direction\nwhile stretching in all transverse directions. Through the Frenet equations of\na moving frame, such surface flows are shown to encode a hierarchy of 2+1\ndimensional integrable SO(3)-invariant vector models, along with their\nbi-Hamiltonian structure, recursion operator, and constants of motion,\ndescribing a geometric realization of 2+1 dimensional bi-Hamiltonian NLS and\nmKdV soliton equations.

A particular attention is paid to a\nchallenging numerical task of an accurate and efficient description of the\nvibrational levels near the dissociation limit (halo-state and Feshbach\nmolecules). Advantages of using B-splines are highlighted by comparing the\nperformance of the method with that of the commonly-used discrete variable\nrepresentation (DVR) approach. Several model cases, including the Morse\npotential and realistic potentials with 1/R^3 and 1/R^6 long-range dependence\nof the internuclear separation are studied. We find that the B-spline method is\nsuperior to the DVR approach and it is robust enough to properly describe the\nFeshbach molecules. The developed numerical method is applied to studying the\nuniversal relation of the energy of the last bound state to the scattering\nlength. We numerically illustrate the validity of the quantum-defect-theoretic\nformulation of such a relation for a 1/R^6 potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2008 03:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The channel state information (CSI) on the link of the\nSU is assumed to be perfectly known at the SU transmitter (SU-Tx). However, due\nto loose cooperation between the SU and the PU, only partial CSI of the link\nbetween the SU-Tx and the PU is available at the SU-Tx. With the partial CSI\nand a prescribed transmit power constraint, our design objective is to\ndetermine the transmit signal covariance matrix that maximizes the rate of the\nSU while keeping the interference power to the PU below a threshold for all the\npossible channel realization within an uncertainty set. This problem, termed\nthe robust cognitive beamforming problem, can be naturally formulated as a\nsemi-infinite programming (SIP) problem with infinitely many constraints.

Some of the most\ndeleterious extra-auditory effects of noise are those leading to sleep\ndisturbances. These disturbances seem to be related to both endogenous\n(physical parameters) and exogenous (sex, age) factors of noise. Despite\ncorrelative relations between noise level and awakenings, the scientific\ncommunity has not reached consensus regarding a specific action of these\nfactors on the different sleep stages. In animal research, 2 complementary main\nfields of research exist. One is focused on the positive modulation of sleep by\nrepeated tone stimulation. The other concerns noise-related sleep disturbances.\nThe few studies that have investigated noise-related sleep disturbances suggest\nthe following conclusions. First, sleep disturbances are greater upon exposure\nto environmental noise, whose frequency spectrum is characterized by high and\nultrasonic sounds, than white noise. Second, unpredictability and pattern of\nnoise events are responsible for extractions from both SWS and PS. Third,\nchronic exposure to noise permanently reduces and fragments sleep. Finally, in\nchronic noise exposure, an inter-individual variability in SWS deficits is\nobserved and correlated to a psychobiological profile related to an\nincapability to face stressful situations. Based on results from other\nresearch, acute noise-related sleep perturbations could result from an\nimbalance in the sleep-wake cycle in favor of arousing ascending systems.\nChronic noise-related sleep disturbances may arise due to imbalance of the\nsleep-wake cycle and malfunctioning of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis\nwhich may both contribute to the development of pathology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2008 07:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

This technique allows\none to measure the shear modulus ($10^{5} -10^{10}$ Pa) of the liquid within a\nfrequency range from 1 mHz to 10 kHz. We analyze the frequency-dependent\nresponse functions to investigate whether time-temperature superposition (TTS)\nis obeyed.

It has been suggested that when TTS applies, the\nhigh-frequency side of the imaginary part of the dielectric response decreases\nlike a power law of the frequency with an exponent -1/2.

The instrument is based on a broadband measurement of\nthe complex reflection coefficient, $S_{\\rm 11}$, of a coaxial transmission\nline, which is terminated to a thin film sample with the electrodes in a\nCorbino disk shape. In the vicinity of the critical temperature, the standard\ncalibration technique using three known standards fails to extract the strong\nfrequency dependence of the complex conductivity induced by the superconducting\nfluctuations. This is because a small unexpected difference between the phase\nparts of $S_{\\rm 11}$ for a short and load standards gives rise to a large\nerror in the detailed frequency dependence of the complex conductivity near the\nsuperconducting transition.

Methods: Following the analytic derivation of Stepinski\n& Valageas (1997), which assumes that grains stick perfectly upon collision, we\nimplement a convenient and fast method of following grain growth in our 3D,\ntwo-phase (gas+dust) SPH code. We then follow the evolution of the size and\nspatial distribution of a dust population in a classical T Tauri star disk.\nResults: We find that the grains go through various stages of growth due to the\ncomplex interplay between gas drag, dust dynamics, and growth. Grains initially\ngrow rapidly as they settle to the mid-plane, then experience a fast radial\nmigration with little growth through the bulk of the disk, and finally pile-up\nin the inner disk where they grow more efficiently. This results in a bimodal\ndistribution of grain sizes. Using this simple prescription of grain growth, we\nfind that grains reach decimetric sizes in 10^5 years in the inner disk and\nsurvive the fast migration phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2008 11:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The nature of the\nearly-type ELS in M16 is derived. The slitless observations with the WFI\nclearly indicate a small number of ELS in M16.

A propagation of dipole radiation in the chain of particles induced\nby the point dipole source placed near one end of the chain is investigated. It\nis found that at sufficiently large refractive index there exist frequency pass\nbands around every low frequency Mie resonance. In particular, if the dipole\noscillates across the chain axis, one can reveal a longitudinal mode frequency\npass band if refractive index of the spheres exceeds 1.9. Then, if the dipole\noscillates transversely to the chain axis, the transverse frequencies pass\nbands show up depending on the chain length. In this case, the pass band is\nformed if the length chain is large enough. Three dielectric materials ZnO,\nrutile and GaAs are considered. It is found that the top of the frequency pass\nband corresponds to the top of the Brillouin band edge in the quasi-momentum\nspace. On the order hand, the bottom of the frequency pass band corresponds to\nthe guiding wave criterion. This explains the remarkable feature of the band\npicture established for infinite chain: the band structure breaks down as the\nwavevector becomes small enough. The multisphere Mie scattering formalism is\nused to calculate how the amplitude of the radiation changes along the chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2008 13:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-10"}

Morphometric differences with respect to a\ntemplate hippocampus were measured by the metric distance obtained from the\nLarge Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) algorithm which was\npreviously used to calculate dense one-to-one correspondence vector fields\nbetween the shapes. LDDMM assigns metric distances on the space of anatomical\nimages thereby allowing for the direct comparison and quantization of\nmorphometric changes. We use various statistical methods to compare the metric\ndistances in a cross-sectional and longitudinal manner. At baseline, the metric\ndistances for demented subjects are found not to be significantly different\nfrom those for nondemented subjects. At follow-up, the metric distances for\ndemented subjects were significantly larger compared to nondemented subjects.\nThe metric distances for demented subjects increased significantly from\nbaseline to follow-up but not for nondemented subjects. We also use the metric\ndistances in logistic regression for diagnostic discrimination of subjects. We\ncompare metric distances with the volumes and obtain similar results. In\nclassification, the model that uses volume, metric distance, and volume loss\nover time together performs better in detecting DAT. Thus, metric distances\nwith respect to a template computed via LDDMM can be a powerful tool in\ndetecting differences in shape in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2008 15:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2008 18:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-14"}

We point out that the Israel-Stewart\nequation is not unique as a causal and dissipative hydrodynamic equation, and\nthe form of the causal and dissipative hydrodynamic equation is determined by\nthe shape of a spectral function reflecting the properties of elementary\nexcitations in the system we consider. Our method utilizes a relaxation\nfunction, which can be calculated from QCD using the linear response theory. We\nshow that the relaxation function can be derived from a spectral function for a\nmicroscopic representation of the dissipative current. We also show that the\nIsrael-Stewart equation is acceptable only as long as the calculated relaxation\nfunction is approximated well by a exponentially damping function, and the\nrelaxation time can be obtained as its damping time constant. Taking a\nbaryon-number dissipative current of a plasma consisting of charm quarks and\ngluons as a simple example, we present the first calculation of the relaxation\nfunction with use of the spectral function derived employing the quenched\nlattice QCD together with the maximum entropy method. The calculated relaxation\nfunction shows a strongly-oscillation damping behaviour due to the charmed\nvector hadron $J/\\Psi$ surviving above the deconfinement phase transition\ntemperature in QCD. This result suggests that the applicability of the\nIsrael-Stewart equation to the baryon-number dissipative current of the charm\nquark-gluon plasma is quite doubtful. We present an idea for the improvement of\nthe Israel-Stewart equation by deriving the hydrodynamic equation consistent\nwith the strongly-oscillation damping relaxation function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2008 15:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-10"}
