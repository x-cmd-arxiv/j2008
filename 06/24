We discuss the\npossibility for an astrophysical scenario to (dis)confirm new physics for heavy\nparticles beyond TeV energy scale. In our scenario, the KK protons (the KK\nexcited quarks/gluons within protons) within the framework of universal extra\ndimensions (UEDs), are produced by high energy p + p collisions in Fermi\naccelerated environments, with protonic isotropic spectrum d N / d E \\propto\nE^-2 up to at least 10^18 eV. Thus, because they are also electrically charged,\nthey should be re-accelerated by mechanism similar to normal protons. The KK\nstates (no matter whether they have already decayed to the lightest KK particle\nor not) should contaminate 10^-5 to 10^-2 of cosmic-ray events for some fixed\nenergy E (within some suitable assumptions). Hence, if we have techniques to\nidentify them from air shower data, we can constrain UEDs scenario. Our method\nis an \"existence proof\" that we can constrain new physics beyond TeV scale or\nmuch higher by classical astrophysical scenarios, which can also be generalized\nto supersymmetric models, the bulk Standard Model fields within the RS model,\nand the endlessly emerging new models.

Currently, our sample includes 1212\nunique stars (many of which are studied by more than one group) with more than\n15000 individual reported elemental abundances, covering all of the relevant\npapers published by December 2007. We discuss the global characteristics of the\npresent database, as revealed by the EMP stars observed to date. For stars with\n[Fe/H] < -2.5, the number of giants with reported abundances is larger than\nthat of dwarfs by a factor of two. The fraction of carbon-rich stars (among the\nsample for which the carbon abundance is reported) amount to ~30 % for [Fe/H] <\n-2.5. We find that known binaries exhibit different distributions of orbital\nperiod, according to whether they are giants or dwarfs, and also as a function\nof metallicity, although the total sample of such stars is still quite small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2008 16:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2008 08:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We first summarise basic\naspects of cosmic rays, focusing on rays of ultra high energy (UHECRs). We\ndiscuss the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min (GZK) energy cutoff for cosmic protons,\nwhich is predicted due to photopion production in the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB). This is a process of modest energy in the proton rest frame.\nIt can be investigated to a high precision in the laboratory, if Lorentz\ntransformations apply even at factors $\\gamma \\sim O(10^{11})$. For heavier\nnuclei the energy attenuation is even faster due to photo-disintegration, again\nif this process is Lorentz invariant. Hence the viability of Lorentz symmetry\nup to tremendous gamma-factors - far beyond accelerator tests - is a central\nissue. Next we comment on conceptual aspects of Lorentz Invariance and the\npossibility of its spontaneous breaking. This could lead to slightly particle\ndependent ``Maximal Attainable Velocities''. We discuss their effect in decays,\nCerenkov radiation, the GZK cutoff and neutrino oscillation in cosmic rays. We\nalso review the search for LIV in cosmic gamma-rays. For multi TeV gamma-rays\nwe possibly encounter another puzzle related to the transparency of the CMB,\nsimilar to the GZK cutoff. The photons emitted in a Gamma Ray Burst occur at\nlower energies, but their very long path provides access to information not far\nfrom the Planck scale. No LIV has been observed so far. However, even extremely\ntiny LIV effects could change the predictions for cosmic ray physics\ndrastically. An Appendix is devoted to the recent hypothesis by the Pierre\nAuger Collaboration, which identifies nearby Active Galactic Nuclei - or\nobjects next to them - as probable UHECR sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2008 16:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2008 09:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We\nrevisit this issue using detailed radiative transfer calculations to model the\nrecent, high signal-to-noise data from the IRS instrument on the {Spitzer Space\nTelescope}. In the case of FU Ori, we find that a physically-plausible flared\ndisk irradiated by the central accretion disk matches the observations.\nBuilding on our previous work, our accretion disk model with outer disk\nirradiation by the inner disk reproduces the spectral energy distribution\nbetween ~4000 angstroms to ~40 microns. Our model is consistent with\nnear-infrared interferometry but there are some inconsistencies with\nmid-infared interferometric results. Including the outer disk allows us to\nrefine our estimate of the outer radius of the outbursting, high mass accretion\nrate disk in FU Ori as ~ 0.5 AU, which is a crucial parameter in assessing\ntheories of the FU Orionis phenomenon. We are able to place an upper limit on\nthe mass infall rate of any remnant envelope infall rate to ~ 7e-7 Msun/yr\nassuming a centrifugal radius of 200 AU. The FUor BBW 76 is also well modelled\nby a 0.6 AU inner disk and a flared outer disk. However, V1515 Cyg requires an\nenvelope with an outflow cavity to adequately reproduce the IRS spectrum. In\ncontrast with the suggestion by Green et al., we do not require a flattened\nenvelope to match the observations; the inferred cavity shape is qualitatively\nconsistent with typical protostellar envelopes. This variety of dusty\nstructures suggests that the FU Orionis phase can be present at either early or\nlate stages of protostellar evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2008 16:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We tackle this\nproblem by employing a Lucy-Richardson deconvolution technique and measuring\nspectral indices in the 4.2-6 keV band.\n  We show that most of the continuum emission is coming from an inner ring that\ncoincides with the location of the reverse shock.

Though Riemannian curvature cannot be neglected since one\nconsiders curved magnetic flux tube axis, the stretch can be neglect since one\nonly considers the limit of thin magnetic flux tubes. The theorem states that\nmarginal or slow dynamos along curved (folded), torsioned (twisted) and\nnon-stretched flux tubes endowed with diffusionless plasma flows, if a\nconstraint is imposed on the relation between poloidal and toroidal magnetic\nfields in the helical dynamo case. A formula for the stretch of flux tubes is\nderived. From this formula one shows that the Riemann flux tube is stretched by\nan interaction between the plasma flow vorticity and torsion, in accordance\nwith our physical intuition. Marginal diffusionless dynamos are shown to exist\nobtained in the case of flux tube dynamos exponential stretching. Thus slow\ndynamos can be obtaining on the flux tube under stretching. Filamentary dynamos\nanti-dynamos are also considered. As flux tubes possess a magnetic axis\ntorsioned filament, it can also be considered as thegerm of a fast dynamo in\nflux tubes Riemannian curved space. It is shown that for non-stretched\nfilaments only untwist and unfold filaments can provide dynamo action in\ndiffusive case.

Imaging\nand spectroscopic analysis confirms the previously detected X-ray source at the\nheart of the annular radio nebula, establishing the radiative properties of two\nkey emission components: a soft unresolved source with a blackbody temperature\nof 1 MK consistent with a neutron star, surrounded by a nonthermal nebula 40''\nin diameter exhibiting a power-law spectrum with photon index Gamma =\n1.6+/-0.3, typical of a pulsar wind nebula. The implied spin-down luminosity of\nthe neutron star, assuming a conversion efficiency to nebular flux appropriate\nto Vela-like pulsars, is ~10^{35} ergs/s, again typical of objects a few tens\nof kyr old. Morphologically, the nebular flux is slightly enhanced along a\ndirection, in projection on the sky, independently demonstrated to be of\nsignificance in radio polarization observations; we argue that this represents\nthe orientation of the pulsar spin axis. At smaller scales, a narrow X-ray\nfeature is seen extending out 5'' from the point source, a distance consistent\nwith the sizes of resolved wind termination shocks around many Vela-like\npulsars. Finally, we argue based on synchrotron lifetimes in the estimated\nnebular magnetic field that DA 495 represents a rare pulsar wind nebula in\nwhich electromagnetic flux makes up a significant part, together with particle\nflux, of the neutron star's wind, and that this high magnetization factor may\naccount for the nebula's low luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2008 20:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Two novelties are observed: the\natypical NR0 gene knirps is present only in brachyceran flies, while the NR2E6\ngene is found only in Tribolium and in Apis. Using a quantitative analysis of\nthe evolutionary rate, we discovered that nuclear receptors could be divided\ninto two groups. In one group of 13 proteins, the rates follow the trend of the\nMecopterida genome-wide acceleration. In a second group of five nuclear\nreceptors, all acting together at the top of the ecdysone cascade, we observed\nan overacceleration of the evolutionary rate during the early divergence of\nMecopterida. We thus extended our analysis to the twelve classic ecdysone\ntranscriptional regulators and found that six of them (ECR, USP, HR3, E75, HR4\nand Kr-h1) underwent an overacceleration at the base of the Mecopterida\nlineage.

Kinetic energy\nis a non-zero positive value in many cases of bound states, when a wave\nfunction is a real-valued one and there are no visible motion and flux.

The ground state energy of a\nhydrogen atom is calculated in a special way, regarding explicitly all the\nterms of electrostatic and kinetic energies. The correct values of the ground\nstate energy and the radius of decay are achieved only when the electrostatic\nenergies of the electron and the proton (self-energies) are not taken into\naccount. This proves again that self-action should be excluded in quantum\nmechanics. A model of a spherical ball with uniformly distributed charge of\nparticles is considered. It is shown that for a neutral ball (with compensated\nelectric charge) the electrostatic energy is a non-zero negative value in this\nmodel.

We argue that boundary 2D lattice models (as well as\nobservables in the form of colored graphs satisfying braiding relations) could\nbe consistently addressed. This is supported by the proof that the Hamiltonian\nof the Levin-Wen condensed string net model in a surface Sigma coincides with\nthe corresponding Turaev-Viro amplitude on Sigma x [0,1] presented in the last\nsection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2008 13:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-24"}

The traditional one-coupling-dominance approach for\nevaluation of the exclusion curves is described. Further, the mixed spin-scalar\ncoupling approach is discussed. It is demonstrated, taking the high-spin Ge-73\ndark matter experiment HDMS as an example, how one can drastically improve the\nsensitivity of the exclusion curves within the mixed spin-scalar coupling\napproach, as well as due to a new procedure of background subtraction from the\nmeasured spectrum.
