Through the comparisons, we find that neon abundance and Ne/O ratio\nincrease with increasing oxygen abundance in both types of nebulae, with\npositive correlation coefficients larger than 0.75. The correlations suggest\ndifferent enrichment mechanisms for oxygen and neon in the ISM, in the sense\nthat the growth of neon is delayed compared to oxygen. The differences of\nabundances between PNe and HII regions, are mainly attributed to the results of\nnucleosynthesis and dredge-up processes that occurred in the progenitor stars\nof PNe. We find that both these alpha-elements are significantly enriched at\nlow metallicity (initial oxygen abundance <= 8.0) but not at metallicity higher\nthan the SMC. The fact that Ne/O ratios measured in PNe are almost the same as\nthose in HII regions, regardless of the metallicity, suggests a very similar\nproduction mechanism of neon and oxygen in intermediate mass stars (IMS) of low\ninitial metallicities and in more massive stars, a conjecture that requires\nverification by further theoretical studies.

The two\nmassive star-formation regions in IC 4662 are excited by stellar populations\nwith ages of ~ 4 million years and masses of ~ 3 x 10^5 M_sun (assuming a\nKroupa IMF). They have high excitation and sub-solar abundances, and they may\nactually be comprised of several massive clusters rather than the single\nmonolithic massive compact objects known as Super Star Clusters (SSCs). Mid-IR\nspectra reveal that these clusters have very high extinctions, A_V ~ 20-25 mag,\nand that the dust in IC 4662 is well-mixed with the emitting gas, not in a\nforeground screen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2008 18:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-04"}

The total mass distribution\nin each of the subclusters is clearly offset (at >4sigma significance) from the\npeak of the hot X-ray emitting gas (the main baryonic component), but aligned\nwith the distribution of galaxies. We measure the fractions of mass in hot gas\n(0.09^{+0.07}_{-0.03}) and stars (0.010^{+0.007}_{-0.004}), consistent with\nthose of typical clusters, finding that dark matter is the dominant contributor\nto the gravitational field.

Cusp\nelliptical envelopes are formed by violent relaxation in mergers acting on\nstars in progenitor disks, while their centers are structured by dissipational\nstarbursts. Core ellipticals are formed by subsequent merging of (now gas-poor)\ncusp ellipticals, with the fossil starburst components combining to preserve a\ncompact component in the remnant (although the 'transition' is smoothed).\nComparing hydrodynamical simulations and observed profiles, we show how to\nobservationally isolate the relic starburst components in core ellipticals.

The typical degree of dissipation is a strong\nfunction of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gas fractions.

Apart from insensitivity of the spin-chain\nfeature to volume expansion, the characteristic features of geometrical\nfrustration interestingly appear at the same temperatures for all compositions,\nin sharp contrast to the response to Y substitution for Ca (reported\npreviously). Interestingly, huge frequency dependence of ac susceptibility\nknown for the parent compound persists for all compositions. We do not find a\nchange in the properties under external pressure. The stability of the magnetic\nanomalies of this compound to the volume change (about 4%) is puzzling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2008 22:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Many cluster galaxies have\nSFR(24 um)/SFR([O II]) >> 1, indicative of star formation highly obscured by\ndust. We focus on the substantial minority of A851 cluster members where strong\nBalmer absorption points to a starburst on a 10^{8-9} year timescale. As is\ntypical, A851 galaxies with strong Balmer absorption occur in two types: with\noptical emission (starforming), and without (post-starburst). Our principal\nresult is the former, so-called e(a) galaxies, are mostly detected (9 out of\n12) at 24 um -- for these we find typically SFR(24 um)/SFR([O II]) ~ 4. Strong\nBalmer absorption and high values of SFR(24 um)/SFR([O II]) both indicate\nmoderately active starbursts and support the picture that e(a) galaxies are the\nactive starbursts that feed the post-starburst population. While 24 um\ndetections are frequent with Balmer-strong objects (even 6 out of 18 of the\nsupposedly \"post-starburst'' galaxies are detected) only 2 out of 7 of the\ncontinuously starforming `e(c)' galaxies (with weak Balmer absorption) are\ndetected -- for them, SFR(24 um)/SFR([O II]) ~ 1. Their optical spectra\nresemble present-epoch spirals that dominate today's universe; we strengthen\nthis association by that SFR(24 um)/SFR([O II]) ~ 1 is the norm today. That is,\nnot just the amount of star formation, but its mode, has evolved strongly from\nz ~ 0.4 to the present. By fitting spectrophotometric models we measure the\nstrength and duration of the bursts to quantify the evolutionary sequence from\nactive- to post-starburst, and to harden the evidence that moderately active\nstarbursts are the defining feature of starforming cluster galaxies at z ~ 0.4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2008 22:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 22:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

X-rays originate\nfrom optically thin shock-heated plasma deep inside the wind and propagate\noutwards throughout absorbing cool material. Recent analyses of the line ratios\nfrom He-like ions in the X-ray spectra of O-stars highlighted problems with\nthis general paradigm: the measured line ratios of highest ions are consistent\nwith the location of the hottest X-ray emitting plasma very close to the base\nof the wind, perhaps indicating the presence of a corona, while measurements\nfrom lower ions conform with the wind-embedded shock model. Generally, to\ncorrectly model the emerging X-ray spectra, a detailed knowledge of the cool\nwind opacities based on stellar atmosphere models is prerequisite. A nearly\ngrey stellar wind opacity for the X-rays is deduced from the analyses of\nhigh-resolution X-ray spectra. This indicates that the stellar winds are\nstrongly clumped. Furthermore, the nearly symmetric shape of X-ray emission\nline profiles can be explained if the wind clumps are radially compressed. In\nmassive binaries the orbital variations of X-ray emission allow to probe the\nopacity of the stellar wind; results support the picture of strong wind\nclumping. In high-mass X-ray binaries, the stochastic X-ray variability and the\nextend of the stellar-wind part photoionized by X-rays provide further strong\nevidence that stellar winds consist of dense clumps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2008 22:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-17"}

One such\ndefinition is given in [1], where an extensive consideration of Stirling\nnumbers is presented. In this paper an alternative definition of Stirling\nnumbers of both kind is given. Namely, Stirling numbers of the first kind\nappear in the closed formula for the n-th derivative of ln x. In the same way\nStirling numbers of the second kind appear in the formula for the n-th\nderivative of f(e^x), where f(x) is an arbitrary smooth real function. This\nfacts allow us to define Stirling numbers within the frame of differential\ncalculus. These definitions may be interesting because arbitrary functions\nappear in them. Choosing suitable function we may obtain different properties\nof Stirling numbers by the use of derivatives only. Using simple properties of\nderivatives we obtain here three important properties of Stirling numbers.\nFirst are so called two terms recurrence relations, from which one can easily\nderive the combinatorial meaning of Stirling numbers. Next we obtain expansion\nformulas of powers into falling factorials, and vise versa. These expansions\nusually serve as the definitions of Stirling numbers, as in [1]. Finally, we\nobtain the exponential generating functions for Stirling and Bell numbers. As a\nby product the closed formulas for the $n$-th derivative of the functions\nf(e^x) and f(ln x) are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 2008 09:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-17"}

To\ncomputationally study the zinc coupled folding of the zinc-fingers, charge\ntransfer and metal induced protonation/deprotonation effects have to be\nconsidered. Here, by attempting to implicitly account for such effects in\nclassical molecular dynamics and performing intensive simulations with explicit\nsolvent for the peptides with and without zinc binding, we investigate the\nfolding of the Cys2His2 type zinc-finger motif and the coupling between the\npeptide folding and zinc binding. We find that zinc ion not only stabilizes the\nnative structure, but also participates in the whole folding process. It binds\nto the peptide at early stage of folding, and directs or modulates the folding\nand stabilizations of the component beta-hairpin and alpha-helix. Such a\ncrucial role of zinc binding is mediated by the packing of the conserved\nhydrophobic residues. We also find that the packing of the hydrophobic residues\nand the coordination of the native ligands are coupled. Meanwhile, the\nprocesses of zinc binding, mis-ligation, ligand exchange and zinc induced\nsecondary structure conversion, as well as the water behaviour, due to the\ninvolvement of zinc ion are characterized. Our results are in good agreement\nwith related experimental observations, and provide significant insight into\nthe general mechanisms of the metal-cofactor dependent protein folding and\nother metal induced conformational changes of biological importance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 2008 10:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-17"}
