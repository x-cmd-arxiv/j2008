The new observations revealed that the\nmorphology and symmetry suggested by Chandra observations (torus and jet-like\nfeatures) are basically preserved in the radio range in spite of the rich\nstructure observed in the radio emission of this PWN, including several arcs,\nbright knots, extensions and filaments. The reprocessed X-ray images show for\nthe first time that the X-ray plasma fills almost the same volume as the radio\nPWN. Notably the X-ray maximum does not coincide with the radio maximum and the\nneutron star candidate CXOU J174722.8-280915 lies within a small depression in\nthe radio emission. From the new radio data we have refined the flux density\nestimates, obtaining S(PWN) ~ 1.57 Jy, almost constant between 3.6 and 20 cm.\nFor the whole SNR (compact core and shell), a flux density S(at 20 cm)= 11.5 Jy\nwas estimated.

This leads to a linear scaling of disk heating with\nsatellite mass: disk heights and velocity dispersions scale ~M_sat/M_disk. In\nturn, observed disk thicknesses present strong constraints on merger histories:\nthe implication for the Milky Way is that <5% of its mass could come from\nmergers since z~2, in conflict with cosmological predictions. More\nrealistically, satellites merge on nearly radial orbits, and once near the\ndisk, resonant interactions efficiently remove angular momentum while tidal\neffects strip mass, leading to rapid merger/destruction in a couple of\nfree-fall plunges. Under these conditions the proper heating efficiency is\nnon-linear in mass ratio, ~(M_sat/M_disk)^2. We derive the scaling of disk\nscale heights and velocity dispersions as a function of mass ratio and disk gas\ncontent in this regime, and show this accurately describes the results of\nsimulations with proper 'live' halos and disks.

We find\nthat a large dust-to-gas ratio, a relatively small starburst disk, a\nsignificant gas mass fraction, and efficient angular momentum transport are all\nimportant to produce a starburst disk that can potentially obscure an AGN. The\ntypical maximum star-formation rate in the disks is ~10 solar masses per year.\nAssuming no mass-loss due to outflows, the starburst disks feed gas onto the\nblack hole at rates sufficient to produce hard X-ray luminosities of\n10^{43}-10^{44} erg s^{-1}.

Supernovae and AGN feedback\nplay an important role in the evolution of these systems. At high redshifts,\nwhen the potential wells of the MW progenitors are shallower, winds driven by\nsupernovae explosions blow out a large fraction of the gas and metals. As the\nsystems grow in mass, SN feedback effects decrease and AGN feedback takes over,\nplaying a more important role in the regulation of the star formation activity\nat lower redshifts. Although model Milky Way galaxies have been selected to lie\nin a narrow range of maximum circular velocities, they nevertheless exhibit a\nsignificant dispersion in the final stellar masses and metallicities. Our\nanalysis suggests that this dispersion results from the different accretion\nhistories of the parent dark matter haloes. Statically, we also find evidences\nto support the Milky Way as a typical Sb/Sc galaxy in the same mass range,\nproviding a suitable benchmark to constrain numerical models of galaxy\nformation\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 21:12:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2009 23:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

While recent\nsurveys have uncovered large numbers of OB stars in the area around Cyg OB2,\ndetailed study of the optically brightest among them suggests that most are not\npart of the association. We observed an additional sample of optically faint OB\nstar candidates, with the aim of checking if more obscured candidates are\ncorrespondingly more likely to be members of Cyg OB2. Low resolution spectra of\n9 objects allow the rejection of one foreground star and the selection of four\nO-type stars, which were later observed at higher resolution. In a subsequent\nrun, we observed three more stars in the classification region and three other\nstars in the far red. We identify five (perhaps six) new evolved very massive\nstars and three main sequence O-type stars, all of which are likely to be\nmembers of Cyg OB2. The new findings allow a much better definition of the\nupper HR diagram, suggesting an age ~2.5Myr for the association and hinting\nthat the O3-5 supergiants in the association are blue stragglers, either\nyounger or following a different evolutionary path from other cluster members.\nThough the bulk of the early stars seems to belong to an (approximately)\nsingle-age population, there is ample evidence for the presence of somewhat\nolder stars at the same distance.

They are\nserendipitously motivated by various extensions of the standard model of\nparticle physics such as Supersymmetry and Universal Extra Dimensions (UED).\nWith its unprecedented sensitivity and its very large energy range (20 MeV to\nmore than 300 GeV) the main instrument on board the GLAST satellite, the Large\nArea Telescope (LAT), will open a new window of discovery. As our estimates\nshow, the LAT will be able to detect an indirect DM signature for a large class\nof WIMP models given a cuspy profile for the DM distribution. Using the current\nstate of the art Monte Carlo and event reconstruction software developed within\nthe LAT collaboration, we present preliminary sensitivity studies for several\npossible sources inside and outside the Galaxy.

Previous attempts to measure robust temperatures at cluster\nvirial radii failed. Aims: The goal of this work is to measure the temperature\nprofile of the very relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2204 out to large radii,\npossibly reaching the virial radius. Methods: Taking advantage of its low\nparticle background due to its low-Earth orbit, Suzaku data are used to measure\nthe outer temperature profile of Abell 2204. These data are combined with\nChandra and XMM-Newton data of the same cluster in order to make the connection\nto the inner regions, unresolved by Suzaku, and to determine the smearing due\nto Suzaku's PSF. Results: The temperature profile of Abell 2204 is determined\nfrom 10 kpc to 1800 kpc, close to an estimate of r200 (the approximation to the\nvirial radius). The temperature rises steeply from below 4 keV in the very\ncenter up to more than 8 keV in the intermediate range and then decreases again\nto about 4 keV at the largest radii. Varying the measured particle background\nnormalization artificially by +-10 percent does not change the results\nsignificantly. Predictions for outer temperature profiles based on hydrodynamic\nsimulations show good agreement. In particular, we find the observed\ntemperature profile to be slightly steeper but consistent with a drop of a\nfactor of 0.6 from 0.3 r200 to r200, as predicted by simulations. Conclusions:\nTemperature measurements up to the virial radius seem feasible with Suzaku,\nwhen a careful analysis of the different background components and the effects\nof the PSF is performed. The result obtained here indicates that numerical\nsimulations capture the intracluster gas physics well in cluster outskirts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 08:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 07:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The main scope here is to demonstrate and\nespecially quantify the effect of sedimentation on vertical displacements of\nthe seabed due to an underwater earthquake. The fault is modelled as a\nVolterra-type dislocation in an elastic half-space. The elastodynamics\nequations are integrated with a finite element method. A comparison between two\ncases is performed. The first one corresponds to the classical situation of an\nelastic homogeneous and isotropic half-space, which is traditionally used for\nthe generation of tsunamis. The second test case takes into account the\npresence of a sediment layer separating the oceanic column from the hard rock.\nSome important differences are revealed. We conjecture that deformations in the\ngeneration region may be amplified by sedimentary deposits, at least for some\nparameter values. The mechanism of amplification is studied through careful\nnumerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 09:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2008 06:31:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 07:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

The variability of an\nEBLUP is traditionally measured by the mean squared prediction error (MSPE),\nand interval estimates are generally constructed using estimates of the MSPE.\nSuch methods have shortcomings like under-coverage or over-coverage, excessive\nlength and lack of interpretability. We propose a parametric bootstrap approach\nto estimate the entire distribution of a suitably centered and scaled EBLUP.\nThe bootstrap histogram is highly accurate, and differs from the true EBLUP\ndistribution by only $O(d^3n^{-3/2})$, where $d$ is the number of parameters\nand $n$ the number of observations.

It is important to make maximum use of the available\nphysical constraints on such models, particularly given the large extrapolation\nfrom current high energy data to LHC energies. In eikonal models, the rate of\nmultiparton interactions is coupled to the energy dependence of the total cross\nsection. Using a Monte Carlo implementation of such a model, we study the\nconnection between the total cross section, the jet cross section, and the\nunderlying event. By imposing internal consistency on the model, we derive\nconstraints on its parameters at the LHC. By imposing internal consistency on\nthe model and comparing to current data we constrain the allowed range of its\nparameters. We show that measurements of the total proton-proton cross-section\nat the LHC are likely to break this internal consistency, and thus to require\nan extension of the model. Likely such extensions are that hard scatters probe\na denser matter distribution inside the proton in impact parameter space than\nsoft scatters, a conclusion also supported by Tevatron data on double-parton\nscattering, and/or that the basic parameters of the model are energy dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 10:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2009 12:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-30"}

Specifically, the\nspacing between two consecutive order statistics is the region which bridges\nthe two order statistics, in the sense that the region contains all the points\nwhose depth values fall between the depth values of the two consecutive order\nstatistics. These multivariate spacings can be viewed as a data-driven\nrealization of the so-called ``statistically equivalent blocks.'' These\nspacings assume a form of center-outward layers of ``shells'' (``rings'' in the\ntwo-dimensional case), where the shapes of the shells follow closely the\nunderlying probabilistic geometry. The properties and applications of these\nspacings are studied. In particular, the spacings are used to construct\ntolerance regions. The construction of tolerance regions is nonparametric and\ncompletely data driven, and the resulting tolerance region reflects the true\ngeometry of the underlying distribution. This is different from most existing\napproaches which require that the shape of the tolerance region be specified in\nadvance. The proposed tolerance regions are shown to meet the prescribed\nspecifications, in terms of $\\beta$-content and $\\beta$-expectation. They are\nalso asymptotically minimal under elliptical distributions. Finally, a\nsimulation and comparison study on the proposed tolerance regions is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 11:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Our agents\ninvest according to their opinion on future price movements, which is based on\nthree sources of information, (i) public information, i.e. news, (ii)\ninformation from their \"friendship\" network and (iii) private information. Our\nbounded rational agents continuously adapt their trading strategy to the\ncurrent market regime by weighting each of these sources of information in\ntheir trading decision according to its recent predicting performance. We find\nthat bubbles originate from a random lucky streak of positive news, which, due\nto a feedback mechanism of these news on the agents' strategies develop into a\ntransient collective herding regime. After this self-amplified exuberance, the\nprice has reached an unsustainable high value, being corrected by a crash,\nwhich brings the price even below its fundamental value. These ingredients\nprovide a simple mechanism for the excess volatility documented in financial\nmarkets. Paradoxically, it is the attempt for investors to adapt to the current\nmarket regime which leads to a dramatic amplification of the price volatility.\nA positive feedback loop is created by the two dominating mechanisms\n(adaptation and imitation) which, by reinforcing each other, result in bubbles\nand crashes. The model offers a simple reconciliation of the two opposite\n(herding versus fundamental) proposals for the origin of crashes within a\nsingle framework and justifies the existence of two populations in the\ndistribution of returns, exemplifying the concept that crashes are\nqualitatively different from the rest of the price moves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 13:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2010 17:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-12"}

While the conversion of\nobserved velocities into true recession velocities has only a small effect on\nthe result, the derivation of unbiased distances which rest on a solid zero\npoint and cover a useful range of about 4-30 Mpc is crucial. A list of 279 such\ngalaxy distances within v<2000 km/s is given which are derived from the tip of\nthe red-giant branch (TRGB), from Cepheids, and from supernovae of type Ia (SNe\nIa). Their random errors are not more than 0.15 mag as shown by\nintercomparison. They trace a linear expansion field within narrow margins from\nv=250 to at least 2000 km/s. Additional 62 distant SNe Ia confirm the linearity\nto at least 20,000 km/s. The dispersion about the Hubble line is dominated by\nrandom peculiar velocities, amounting locally to <100 km/s but increasing\noutwards. Due to the linearity of the expansion field the Hubble constant H_0\ncan be found at any distance >4.5 Mpc. RR Lyr star-calibrated TRGB distances of\n78 galaxies above this limit give H_0=63.0+/-1.6 at an effective distance of 6\nMpc. They compensate the effect of peculiar motions by their large number.\nSupport for this result comes from 28 independently calibrated Cepheids that\ngive H_0=63.4+/-1.7 at 15 Mpc. This agrees also with the large-scale value of\nH_0=61.2+/-0.5 from the distant, Cepheid-calibrated SNe Ia. A mean value of\nH_0=62.3+/-1.3 is adopted. Because the value depends on two independent zero\npoints of the distance scale its systematic error is estimated to be 6%.\nTypical errors of H_0 come from the use of a universal, yet unjustified P-L\nrelation of Cepheids, the neglect of selection bias in magnitude-limited\nsamples, or they are inherent to the adopted models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 14:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this note we discuss the possible effects of such a\nscheme on the flavor ratio of high-energy cosmic neutrinos from cosmologically\ndistant astrophysical sources. It is shown that in principle there is still a\nchance to observe deviation from the standard three flavor scenario in the\nflavor ratio of the high-energy cosmic neutrinos.

Although the statistics of data from\none source in the next generation of neutrino telescopes are estimated not to\nbe sufficient to distinguish the three and four family schemes, if we can gain\nstatistics by, e.g., summing over data from many sources, then it might be\npossible to have a signature for the (3+1)-scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 15:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-19"}

Both pure heptane drops and\ndiluted crude oil drops are considered (in the second case the interface is\ncovered by amphiphilic species, natural components of crude oil). Shadowgraph\nimages of the drops are taken by means of a high speed camera and the drop\ncontour is detected by image processing. The axisymmetric drop shape is then\ndecomposed into spherical harmonics, which constitute the eigenmodes of\noscillations predicted by the Rayleigh-Lamb theory. Time evolution of each mode\nis then obtained. The frequency and the damping rate of the principal mode\n(n=2) are accurately determined and compared with theoretical values for an\nimmobile clean drop oscillating around spherical shape. For pure heptane drops,\ntheoretical value of the frequency agrees well with experiments whereas the\ndamping rate is significantly underestimated by theory. The experimental\nresults clearly show that the different modes are coupled. Energy is thus\ntransfered from mode n=2 to n=3, which probably explains the observed\nenhancement of the damping rate. The effect of the interface viscoelastic\nbehaviour, induced by adsorbed amphiphilic species on the free oscillations was\nexamined. No significant effect was observed in the experiments conditions\n(small amplitude oscillations and moderate aging).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 15:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

It is based this approach on a multi-agent concept and on the\nprinciple of distributed network of enterprises. For this purpose, each\nenterprise is defined as autonomous and performs simultaneously at the local\nand global levels. The basic component of our approach is a so-called Virtual\nEnterprise Node (VEN), where the enterprise network is represented as a set of\ntiers (like in a product breakdown structure). Within the network, each partner\nconstitutes a VEN, which is in contact with several customers and suppliers.\nExchanges between the VENs ensure the autonomy of decision, and guarantiee the\nconsistency of information and material flows. Only two complementary VEN\nagents are necessary: one for external interactions, the Negotiator Agent (NA)\nand one for the planning of internal decisions, the Planner Agent (PA). If\nsupply problems occur in the network, two other agents are defined: the Tier\nNegotiator Agent (TNA) working at the tier level only and the Supply Chain\nMediator Agent (SCMA) working at the level of the enterprise network. These two\nagents are only active when the perturbation occurs. Otherwise, the VENs\nprocess the flow of information alone. With this new approach, managing\nenterprise network becomes much more transparent and looks like managing a\nsimple enterprise in the network. The use of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) allows\nphysical distribution of the decisional system, and procures a heterarchical\norganization structure with a decentralized control that guaranties the\nautonomy of each entity and the flexibility of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 15:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
