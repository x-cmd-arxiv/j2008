It is also known that the permittivity of ferroelectric polydomain films\nis controlled by the sum of two contributions: the crystal lattice (intrinsic)\ncontribution and the domain wall movement (extrinsic) contribution. It is the\nlatter one, which is very sensitive to the aforementioned phenomena and which\nplays a key role in the deterioration of the dielectric response of the\nferroelectric polydomain films. In this Article, there is presented a method\nfor the identification of the process, which is responsible for the\nferroelectric ageing. The method is based on the analysis of the evolution of\nboth the linear and nonlinear permittivity during ageing. Applicability of the\nmethod is theoretically demonstrated on four ageing scenarios in two\nqualitatively different systems where the evolution of the nonlinear\npermittivity is controlled, first, by a redistribution of the pinning centers\non the domain wall and, second, by microstructural changes at the interface\nbetween the ferroelectric layer and the electrode. It is shown that each ageing\nscenario is characterized by unique trend in the evolution between the linear\nand nonlinear part of the permittivity, which can be verified experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 14:13:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2008 11:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-12"}

We find\nthat dN/dt depends on the ratio R=r_h/r_j, where r_h is the half-mass radius\nand r_j the radius of the zero-velocity surface. For R>0.05, the \"tidal\nregime\", there is almost no dependence of dN/dt on R. To first order this is\nbecause the fraction of escapers per relaxation time, t_rh, scales\napproximately as R^1.5, which cancels out the r_h^1.5 term in t_rh. For R<0.05,\nthe \"isolated regime\", dN/dt scales as R^-1.5. Clusters that start with their\ninitial R, Ri, in the tidal regime dissolve completely in this regime and their\nt_dis is insensitive to the initial r_h. We predicts that clusters that start\nwith Ri<0.05 always expand to the tidal regime before final dissolution. Their\nt_dis has a shallower dependence on Ri than what would be expected when t_dis\nis a constant times t_rh. For realistic values of Ri, the lifetime varies by\nless than a factor of 1.5 due to changes in Ri. This implies that the\n\"survival\" diagram for globular clusters should allow for more small clusters\nto survive. We note that with our result it is impossible to explain the\nuniversal peaked mass function of globular cluster systems by dynamical\nevolution from a power-law initial mass function, since the peak will be at\nlower masses in the outer parts of galaxies. Our results finally show that in\nthe tidal regime t_dis scales as N^0.65/w, with w the angular frequency of the\ncluster in the host galaxy.

One powerful method for inferring these sequence\nattributes is through comparison of a query sequence with reference sequences\nthat contain significant homology and whose structure, function, and/or\nevolutionary relationships are already known. In spite of decades of concerted\nwork, there is no simple framework for deducing structure, function, and\nevolutionary (SF&E) relationships directly from sequence information alone,\nespecially when the pair-wise identity is less than a threshold figure ~25%\n[1,2].

For the other two regions, IRAS 20126+4104 and IRAS\n22172+5549, the former has the lowest number of YSOs in the sample and shows no\nobvious cluster, and the latter appears to be part of a larger, potentially\nmore evolved cluster. The deep IRAC imaging reveals at least twelve outflows in\neight out of the nine regions, with nine outflows prominent in the 4.5 $\\mu$m\nband most probably attributed to shocked H$_2$ emission, two outflows dominated\nby scattered light in the 3.6 and 4.5 $\\mu$m bands, and one outflow standing\nout from its hydrocarbon emission in the 8.0 $\\mu$m band. In comparison with\nprevious ground-based observations, our IRAC observations reveal new outflow\nstructures in five regions. The dramatically different morphologies of detected\noutflows can be tentatively interpreted in terms of possible evolution of\nmassive outflows. The driving sources of these outflows are deeply embedded in\ndense dusty cores revealed by previous millimeter interferometric observations.\nWe detect infrared counterparts of these dusty cores in the IRAC or MIPS 24\n$\\mu$m bands. Reflection nebulae dominated by the emission from UV heated\nhydrocarbons in the 8 $\\mu$m band can be found in most regions and they may\nimply the presence of young B stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 03:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the random link model, at discrete time\nsteps, the walker moves to the nearest site, which has not been visited in the\nlast $\\mu$ steps (memory), producing a deterministic partially self avoiding\nwalk (the tourist walk). We have obtained analitically the distribution of the\nnumber $n$ of points explored by a walker with memory $\\mu = 2$, as well as the\ntransient and period joint distribution.

For simplicity we\nchoose a $^{208}$Pb target, which is a spin-saturated spherical nucleus for\nwhich reliable nuclear structure models exist. Microscopic scalar and vector\noptical potentials are generated by folding invariant scalar and vector\nscattering nucleon-nucleon (NN) amplitudes, based on our recently developed\nrelativistic meson-exchange model, with Lorentz scalar and vector densities\nresulting from the accurately calibrated PK1 relativistic mean field model of\nnuclear structure. It is seen that phenomenological Pauli blocking (PB) effects\nand density-dependent corrections to $\\sigma$N and $\\omega$N meson-nucleon\ncoupling constants modify the RIA microscopic scalar and vector optical\npotentials so as to provide a consistent and quantitative description of all\nelastic scattering observables, namely total reaction cross sections,\ndifferential cross sections, analyzing powers and spin rotation functions. In\nparticular, the effect of PB becomes more significant at energies lower than\n200 MeV, whereas phenomenological density-dependent corrections to the NN\ninteraction {\\it also} play an increasingly important role at energies lower\nthan 100 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 13:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Moreover, the spherically symmetric setting\nof inhomogeneity illustrates several non-trivial properties of lattice\nrefinements of discrete quantum gravity.

Moreover, the bispectral involution on these operators has dynamical\nsignificance for the spin Calogero particles system whose phase space such\npairs represent. In the case $r=1$, this reproduces well-known results of\nWilson and others from the 1990's relating (spinless) Calogero-Moser systems to\nthe bispectrality of (scalar) differential operators. This new class of pairs\n$(L, \\Lambda)$ of bispectral matrix differential operators is different than\nthose previously studied in that $L$ acts from the left, but $\\Lambda$ from the\nright on a common $r\\times r$ eigenmatrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 15:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Ultraviolet and infrared\ndivergencies are both treated in dimensional regularization. Analytical\nexpressions for the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha)$ corrections to the invariant Compton\nscattering amplitudes, $A(s,u)$ and $B(s,u)$, are presented for 11 classes of\ncontributing one-loop diagrams. Infrared finiteness of the virtual radiative\ncorrections is achieved (in the standard way) by including soft photon\nradiation below an energy threshold $\\lambda$, and its relation to the\nexperimental detection threshold is discussed. We find that the radiative\ncorrections are maximal in backward directions, reaching e.g. -2.4% for a\ncenter-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=4m_\\pi$ and $\\lambda=5 $MeV. Furthermore, we\nextend our calculation of the radiative corrections by including the leading\npion structure effect (at low energies) in form of its electric and magnetic\npolarizability difference, $\\alpha_\\pi - \\beta_\\pi \\simeq 6\\cdot 10^{-4}\n$fm$^3$. We find that this structure effect does not change the relative size\nand angular dependence of the radiative corrections to pion Compton scattering.\nOur results are particularly relevant for analyzing the COMPASS experiment at\nCERN which aims at measuring the pion electric and magnetic polarizabilities\nwith high statistics using the Primakoff effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 15:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2008 16:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
