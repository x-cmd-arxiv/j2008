Although the spatial extent of\nthe 4$d$ orbitals is quite large, many experimental results have suggested that\nelectron-electron correlations play an important role in determining this\nmaterial's electronic structure. In order to investigate the importance of\ncorrelation, we use two approaches which go beyond the conventional local\ndensity approximation to density functional theory (DFT): the local spin\ndensity approximation + Hubbard $U$ (LSDA+$U$) and the pseudopotential\nself-interaction correction (pseudo-SIC) methods. We find that the details of\nthe electronic structure predicted with the LSDA do not agree with the\nexperimental spectroscopic data for bulk and thin film SrRuO$_3$. Improvement\nis found by including electron-electron correlations, and we suggest that bulk\northorhombic SrRuO$_3$ is a {\\it weakly strongly-correlated} ferromagnet whose\nelectronic structure is best described by a 0.6 eV on-site Hubbard term, or\nequivalently with corrections for the self-interaction error. We also perform\n{\\it ab initio} transport calculations that confirm that SrRuO$_3$ has a\nnegative spin polarization at the Fermi level, due to the position of the\nminority Ru 4$d$ band center. Even with correlations included in our\ncalculations we are unable to reproduce the experimentally observed\nmetal-insulator transition, suggesting that the electronic behavior of\nSrRuO$_3$ ultra-thin films might be dominated by extrinsic factors such as\nsurface disorder and defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2008 08:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-08"}

Yet, there are examples that are claimed\nto violate this assumption. The apparent paradox presented by such examples, if\nnot settled, would demonstrate the inconsistency and/or incompleteness of the\nBayesian approach and without eliminating this inconsistency, the approach\ncannot be regarded as scientific.\n  The Sleeping Beauty Problem is just such an example.

The observation of\nspectral lines with strong coupling with hyperfine structure, like the observed\nMnI line at 553.7 nm, allows such differentiation.\n  The main aim is to analyse the distribution of field strengths in the network\nand intranetwork of the solar photosphere through inversion of the MnI line at\n553.7 nm.\n  An inversion code for the magnetic field using the Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) has been developed. Statistical tests are run on the code to\nvalidate it. The code has to draw information from the small-amplitude spectral\nfeature oppearing in the core of the Stokes V profile of the observed line for\nfield strengths below a certain threshold, coinciding with lower limit of the\nPaschen-Back effect in the fine structure of the involved atomic levels.\n  The inversion of the observed profiles, using the circular polarization (V)\nand the intensity (I), shows the presence of magnetic fields strengths in a\nrange from 0 to 2 kG, with predominant weak strength values. Mixed regions with\nmean strength field values of 1130 and 435 Gauss are found associated with the\nnetwork and intranetwork respectively.\n  The MnI line at 553 nm probes the field strength distribution in the quiet\nsun and shows the predominance of weak, hectoGauss fields in the intranetwork,\nand strong, kiloGauss fields in the network. It also shows that both network\nand intranetwork are to be understood at our present spatial resolutions as\nfield distributions of which we hint the mean properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2008 13:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A Liouville structure is an essential ingredient of every\nvariational formulation of a physical theory. For reasons of interpretation the\nLiouville structure can not be replaced by the corresponding cotangent\nfibration. We give a precise definition of Liouville structures, study their\nproperties, and give examples used in variational formulations of mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2008 15:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-10"}

A feature selection procedure is applied during\nlearning to accelerate recognition. We introduce a simple attention-like\nfeedback mechanism, significantly improving recognition and robustness in\nmultiple-object scenes. In experiments, the proposed algorithm achieves or\nexceeds state-of-the-art success rate on object recognition, texture and\nsatellite image classification, language identification and sound\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2008 10:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-10"}
