Unitary dynamics is given by point-form\ninteraction picture, with minimal-coupling Hamiltonian constructed from fields\nthat are free on the null-cone boundary of the Milne universe. SL(2,C)\ntransformations and dynamics are represented unitarily in positive-norm Hilbert\nspace describing $N$ four-dimensional oscillators. Vacuum is a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate of the $N$-oscillator gas. Both the form of $A_a(x)$ and its\ntransformation properties are determined by an analogue of the twistor\nequation. The same equation guarantees that the subspace of vacuum states is,\nas a whole, Poincar\\'e invariant. The formalism is tested on quantum fields\nproduced by pointlike classical sources. Photon statistics is well defined even\nfor pointlike charges, with UV/IR regularizations occurring automatically as a\nconsequence of the formalism.

The first aim of the work is to test how the present Langevin model is\nable to describe this phenomenon and to outline the physical as- pects which\nplay a major role in particle deposition. The general features and\ncharacteristics of the present stochastic model are first recalled. Then,\nresults obtained with the standard form of the model are presented along with\nan analysis which has been carried out to check the sensitivity of the\npredictions on different mean fluid quantities. These results show that the\nphysical repre- sentation of the near-wall physics has to be improved and that,\nin particular, one possible route is to introduce specific features related to\nthe near-wall coherent structures. In the following, we propose a simple\nphenomenological model that introduces some of the effects due to the presence\nof turbulent coherent structures on particles in a thin layer close to the\nwall. The results obtained with this phenomenological model are in good\nagreement with experimental evidence and this suggests to pursue in that\ndirection, towards the development of more general and rigorous stochastic\nmodels that provide a link between a geometrical description of turbulent flow\nand a statistical one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jun 2008 16:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-27"}

Using a\nlarge sample of 37 short and 421 long GRBs, we find a strong correlation\nbetween the afterglow brightness measured after 11 hours and the observed\nfluence of the prompt emission. Both the optical (R band) and X-ray flux\ndensities (F_R and F_X) scale with the gamma-ray fluence, F_gamma. For bursts\nwith a known redshift, a tight correlation exists between the afterglow flux\ndensities at 11 hours (rest-frame) and the total isotropic gamma-ray energy,\nEgi: F_{R,X} ~ Egi^{alpha}, with alpha ~ 1. The constant of proportionality is\nnearly identical for long and short bursts, when Egi is obtained from the Swift\ndata. Additionally, we find that for short busts with F_gamma >10^{-7} erg\ncm^{-2}, optical afterglows are nearly always detected by reasonably deep early\nobservations. Finally, we show that the ratio F_R/F_X has very similar values\nfor short and long bursts. These results are difficult to explain in the\nframework of the standard scenario, since they require that either (1) the\nnumber density of the surrounding medium of short bursts is typically\ncomparable to, or even larger than the number density of long bursts; (2) short\nbursts explode into a density profile, n(r)\\alpha r^{-2} or (3) the prompt\ngamma-ray fluence depends on the density of the external medium. We therefore\nfind it likely that either basic assumptions on the properties of the\ncircumburst environment of short GRBs or else the standard models of GRB\nemission must be re-examined. We believe that the most likely solution is that\nthe ambient density surrounding typical short bursts is higher than has\ngenerally been expected: a typical value of ~1 per cm^{-3} is indicated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2008 03:32:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 May 2009 20:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-05"}

The\nparameter space of the halo is optimized so as to match the observed HI\nthickness distribution as well as the rotation curve on an equal footing,\nunlike the previous studies of M31 which were based on rotation curves alone.\nWe show that an oblate halo, with an isothermal density profile, provides the\nbest fit to the observed data. This gives a central density of 0.011 M_sun\n/pc^3, a core radius of 21 kpc, and an axis ratio of 0.4. The main result from\nthis work is the flattened dark matter halo for M31, which is required to match\nthe outer galactic HI scale height data.

QRS has the advantage of\nhaving equal diagonal value for the decomposed channel, but the subchannels are\nnot fully parallelized, hence requiring successive interference cancellation or\nother techniques to perform decoding. We consider a closed-loop system where\nthe feedback information is a unitary beamforming matrix. Due to the discrete\nand limited modulation set, SVD may have inferior performance to QRS when no\nmodulation set selection is performed. However, if the selection of modulation\nset is performed optimally, we show that SVD can outperform QRS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2008 07:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-24"}

Since a free surface cannot support\nshear stress, adhesive locomotion is not a viable propulsion mechanism for\nwater snails that travel inverted beneath the free surface. Nevertheless, the\nmotion of the freshwater snail, Sorbeoconcha physidae, is reminiscent of that\nof its terrestrial counterparts, being generated by the undulation of the snail\nfoot that is separated from the free surface by a thin layer of mucus. Here, a\nlubrication model is used to describe the mucus flow in the limit of small\namplitude interfacial deformations. By assuming the shape of the snail foot to\nbe a traveling sine wave and the mucus to be Newtonian, an evolution equation\nfor the interface shape is obtained and the resulting propulsive force on the\nsnail is calculated. This propulsive force is found to be non-zero for moderate\nvalues of Capillary number but vanishes in the limits of high and low Capillary\nnumbers.

In this scenario, we exploit the fact that under\npower constraints, although each radio maximizes independently its rate by\nwater-filling on their channel transfer matrix singular values, frequently, not\nall of them are used.

Our key result is that braidability implies\nspreadability and thus conditional independence, according to the\nnoncommutative extended de Finetti theorem (of C. K\\\"{o}stler). This endows the\nbraid groups $B_n$ with a new intrinsic (quantum) probabilistic interpretation.\nWe underline this interpretation by a braided extension of the Hewitt-Savage\nZero-One Law.\n  Furthermore we use the concept of product representations of endomorphisms\n(of R.

This\ntechnique is based on the angular momentum alignment of atoms and ions in their\nground or metastable states. As the life-time of atoms in such states is long,\nthe alignment induced by anisotropic radiation is susceptible to weak magnetic\nfields ($1{\\rm G}\\gtrsim B\\gtrsim0.1\\mu$G). The alignment reveals itself in\nterms of the polarization of the absorbed and emitted light. A variety of atoms\nwith fine or hyperfine splitting of the ground or metastable states exhibit the\nalignment and the resulting polarization degree in some cases exceeds 20%. We\nshow that in the case of absorption the polarization direction is either\nparallel or perpendicular to magnetic field, while more complex dependencies\nemerge for the case of emission of aligned atoms. We show that the\ncorresponding studies of magnetic fields can be performed with optical and UV\npolarimetry. A unique feature of these studies is that they can reveal the 3D\norientation of magnetic field.\n  In addition, we point out that the polarization of the radiation arising from\nthe transitions between fine and hyperfine states of the ground level can\nprovide yet another promising diagnostics of magnetic fields, including the\nmagnetic fields in the Early Universe. We mention several cases of\ninterplanetary, circumstellar and interstellar magnetic fields for which the\nstudies of magnetic fields using ground state atomic alignment effect are\npromising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2008 15:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-24"}

METODS: [...] Within the fireshell\nmodel [...] We can then build two sets of ``gedanken'' GRBs varying the total\nenergy of the electron-positron plasma E^{e^\\pm}_{tot} and keeping the same\nbaryon loading B of GRB050315. The first set assumes for the effective CBM\ndensity the one obtained in the fit of GRB050315. The second set assumes\ninstead a constant CBM density equal to the average value of the GRB050315\nprompt phase. RESULTS: For the first set of ``gedanken'' GRBs we find a\nrelation E_p\\propto (E_{aft})^a, with a = 0.45 \\pm 0.01, whose slope strictly\nagrees with the Amati one. Such a relation, in the limit B \\to 10^{-2},\ncoincides with the Amati one. Instead, in the second set of ``gedanken'' GRBs\nno correlation is found. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis excludes the Proper-GRB\n(P-GRB) from the prompt emission, extends all the way to the latest afterglow\nphases and is independent on the assumed cosmological model, since all\n``gedanken'' GRBs are at the same redshift. The Amati relation, on the other\nhand, includes also the P-GRB, focuses on the prompt emission only, and is\ntherefore influenced by the instrumental threshold which fixes the end of the\nprompt emission, and depends on the assumed cosmology. This may well explain\nthe intrinsic scatter observed in the Amati relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2008 15:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-06"}
