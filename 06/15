These models are more challenging than those considered in\narXiv:0712.2041 [hep-ph]; although they produce a new light resonance which\ndecays to heavy standard model fermions, they exhibit no light dilepton\nresonance. A heavy $Z'$ decaying to v-hadrons, which in turn decay mainly to\nbottom quarks and tau leptons, is considered; six case studies are\ninvestigated, using a new Monte Carlo simulation package. It is found that the\none-to-one correspondence of jets and partons is badly broken, and the\nhigh-multiplicity heavy-flavor signal probably cannot be isolated by counting\njets, with or without heavy-flavor tags. Instead, other measures, such as\ncounting and correlating vertices or displaced tracks, and possibly counting of\n(non-isolated) muons and use of event-shape variables, should be combined with\nscalar transverse energy and/or missing transverse energy to reduce\nbackgrounds. Within the resulting sample, searches for the v-pion mass\nresonance in both di-jet and single-jet invariant mass can help confirm a\nsignal. The best observable in a perfect calorimeter seems to be single-jet\ninvariant mass for jets of larger radius ($R$=0.7), although this needs further\nstudy in a realistic setting.

This study analyses the most prominent sources of\nuncertainty. The diffusive nature of the process makes the inversion relatively\nrobust against incomplete knowledge of the thermal diffusivity. Similarly the\ninfluence of heat production is small. It turns out that for investigations of\nthe last 1000 to 100000 years the maximum depth of the temperature log is\ncrucial. More than 3000 m are required for an optimal inversion.\nReconstructions of the last one or two millennia require only modestly deep\nlogs (>300 m) but suffer severely from noisy data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 2008 19:38:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-17"}

Gas metallicities are measured, for an initial\nsample of nine star forming galaxies at z~3.5, by means of optical nebular\nlines redshifted into the near-IR. Stellar masses are accurately determined by\nusing Spitzer-IRAC data, which sample the rest-frame near-IR stellar light in\nthese distant galaxies. When compared with previous surveys, the\nmass-metallicity relation inferred at z~3.5 shows an evolution much stronger\nthan observed at lower redshifts. The evolution is prominent even in massive\ngalaxies, indicating that z~3 is an epoch of major action in terms of star\nformation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. There are also\nindications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is stronger\nrelative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemical\nversion of the galaxy downsizing. The mass-metallicity relation observed at\nz~3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchical\nevolutionary models.

In a canonical example of a two-path interferometer with a\nwhich-path detector, observation of interference and obtaining which-path\ninformation are mutually exclusive. Such duality has been demonstrated in\noptics with a pair of correlated photons and in solid-state devices with\nphase-coherent electrons. In the latter case, which-path information was\nprovided by a charge detector embedded near one path of a two-path electron\ninterferometer. Note that suppression of interference can always be understood\neither as obtaining path information or as unavoidable back action by the\ndetector. The present study reports on dephasing of an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring\ninterferometer via a coupled charge detector adjacent to the ring. In contrast\nto the two-path interferometer, charge detection in the ring does not always\nprovide path information. Indeed, we found that the interference was suppressed\nonly when path information could be acquired, even if only in principle. This\ndemonstrates that dephasing does not always take place by coupling the\n`environment' to the interfering particle: path information of the particle\nmust be available too. Moreover, this is valid regardless of the strength of\nenvironment-interferometer coupling, which refutes the general notion of the\neffect of strong interaction with the environment. In other words, it verifies\nthat an acquisition of which-path information is more fundamental than the\nback-action in understanding quantum mechanical complementarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 2008 05:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-17"}
