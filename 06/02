Spatial derivatives of the linear density correlation, which were\nignored in the calculation of Bardeen, Bond, Kaiser & Szalay (1986), are\nincluded in our analysis. These functions exhibit large oscillations around the\nsound horizon scale for generic CDM power spectra. We derive the exact\nleading-order expression for the correlation of density peaks and demonstrate\nthe contribution of those spatial derivatives. In particular, we show that\nthese functions can modify significantly the baryon acoustic signature of\ndensity maxima relative to that of the linear density field. The effect depends\nupon the exact value of the peak height, the filter shape and size, and the\nsmall-scale behaviour of the transfer function. In the LambdaCDM cosmology, for\nmaxima identified in the density field smoothed at mass scale M\\approx\n10^{12}-10^{14}M_sun/h and with linear threshold height \\nu=1.673/\\sigma(M),\nthe contrast of the BAO can be a few tens of percent larger than in the linear\nmatter correlation. Overall, the BAO is amplified (damped) for threshold\nheights larger (less) than unity. Density maxima thus behave quite differently\nthan linearly biased tracers of the density field, whose acoustic signature is\na simple scaled version of the linear baryon acoustic oscillation. We also\ncalculate the mean streaming of peak pairs in the quasi-linear regime. We show\nthat the leading-order 2-point correlation and pairwise velocity of density\npeaks are consistent with a nonlinear, local biasing relation involving\ngradients of the density field. Biasing will be an important issue in\nascertaining how much of the enhancement of the BAO in the primeval correlation\nof density maxima propagates into the late-time clustering of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 07:43:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 21:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2008 22:23:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2008 14:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Adopting a bottom up\napproach, the assumption that the dynamics of the GUT model can in principle\ndecouple from Planck scale physics leads to a surprisingly predictive\nframework. An internal U(1) hypercharge flux Higgses the GUT group directly to\nthe MSSM or to a flipped GUT model, a mechanism unavailable in heterotic\nmodels. This new ingredient automatically addresses a number of puzzles present\nin traditional GUT models. The internal U(1) hyperflux allows us to solve the\ndoublet-triplet splitting problem, and explains the qualitative features of the\ndistorted GUT mass relations for lighter generations due to the Aharanov-Bohm\neffect. These models typically come with nearly exact global symmetries which\nprevent bare mu terms and also forbid dangerous baryon number violating\noperators. Strong curvature around our brane leads to a repulsion mechanism for\nLandau wave functions for neutral fields. This leads to large hierarchies of\nthe form exp(-c/B^(2*g)) where c and g are order one parameters and B ~\nM_(GUT)/(M_(pl)*alpha_(GUT)). This effect can simultaneously generate a viably\nsmall mu term as well as an acceptable Dirac neutrino mass on the order of 0.5\n* 10^(-2 +/- 0.5) eV. In another scenario, we find a modified seesaw mechanism\nwhich predicts that the light neutrinos have masses in the expected range while\nthe Majorana mass term for the heavy neutrinos is ~ 3 * 10^(12 +/- 1.5) GeV.\nCommunicating supersymmetry breaking to the MSSM can be elegantly realized\nthrough gauge mediation. In one scenario, the same repulsion mechanism also\nleads to messenger masses which are naturally much lighter than the GUT scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 10:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 21:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2009 03:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In contrast to the model known as the Kuznetsov equation, the\nproposed nonlinear wave equation preserves the Hamiltonian structure of the\nfundamental fluid dynamical equations in the non-dissipative limit. An exact\ntraveling front solution is obtained from a generalized traveling wave\nassumption. This solution is, in an overall sense, equivalent to the Taylor\nshock solution of the Burgers equation. However, in contrast to the Burgers\nequation, the model equation considered here is capable to describe waves\npropagating in opposite directions. Owing to the Hamiltonian structure of the\nproposed model equation, the front solution is in agreement with the classical\nRankine-Hugoniot relations. The exact front solution propagates at supersonic\nspeed with respect to the fluid ahead of it, and subsonic speed with respect to\nthe fluid behind it, similarly to the fluid dynamical shock. Linear stability\nanalysis reveals that the front is stable when the acoustic pressure belongs to\na critical interval, and is otherwise unstable. These results are verified\nnumerically.

It is an approach based on\nanother known universal dynamics: The evolutionary dynamics first conceived by\nDarwin and Wallace, referring to as Darwinian dynamics in the present paper,\nhas been found to be universally valid in biology; The statistical mechanics\nand thermodynamics, while enormously successful in physics, have been in an\nawkward situation of wanting a consistent dynamical understanding; Here we\npresent from a formal point of view an exploration of the connection between\nthermodynamics and Darwinian dynamics and a few related topics. We first show\nthat the stochasticity in Darwinian dynamics implies the existence temperature,\nhence the canonical distribution of Boltzmann-Gibbs type. In term of relative\nentropy the Second Law of thermodynamics is dynamically demonstrated without\ndetailed balance condition, and is valid regardless of size of the system. In\nparticular, the dynamical component responsible for breaking detailed balance\ncondition does not contribute to the change of the relative entropy. Two types\nof stochastic dynamical equalities of current interest are explicitly discussed\nin the present approach: One is based on Feynman-Kac formula and another is a\ngeneralization of Einstein relation. Both are directly accessible to\nexperimental tests. Our demonstration indicates that Darwinian dynamics\nrepresents logically a simple and straightforward starting point for\nstatistical mechanics and thermodynamics and is complementary to and consistent\nwith conservative dynamics that dominates the physical sciences. Present\nexploration suggests the existence of a unified stochastic dynamical framework\nboth near and far from equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jun 2008 23:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-03"}

Using the general quantum-mechanical\nprinciples, we show that, due to interatomic interaction, each atom of He-II\nacquires a small fluctuating induced dipole moment. A directed flux of\nmicroscopic vortex rings -- which, together with phonons, are thermal\nexcitations of He II -- forms in the second-sound standing halfwave. This flux\npartially orders the chaotically oriented dipole moments of the atoms, which\nresults in volume polarization of He II. The observed electric induction can be\nexplained theoretically under the assumption that each vortex ring possesses a\ndipole moment of the order of ten atomic moments. It is shown also that the\ntheoretical value of the voltage U induced in He II by the volume system of\ndipoles strongly depends on the dimensions of the resonator for dipoles of any\norigin. The experimental value of U is the same for two resonators of different\nsize; therefore, this voltage may be not connected with the volume polarization\nof He II.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 10:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-14"}

With the exception of MgB2\n(Tc =39 K), however, Tc is generally far lower than desired. Recently,\nbreakthrough has been made in a new class of oxypnictide compounds. Following\nthe initial discovery of superconductivity in LaO1-x FxFeAs (Tc =26 K), Tc\nonset has been raised to 55 K in ReO1-xFxFeAs (Re: Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm). Meanwhile,\nunravelling the nature of the energy associated with the formation of\ncurrent-carrying pairs (Cooper pairs), referred to as the superconducting\nenergy gap, is the first and vital step towards understanding why the\nsuperconductivity occurs at such high temperature and is also important for\nfinding superconductors with still higher Tc. Here we show that, on the basis\nof the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in PrO0.89F0.11FeAs (Tc\n=45 K), the Cooper pair is in the spin-singlet state (two spins are\nanti-paralleled), with two energy gaps opening below Tc.

In a\nsample of sixteen quasars at z(QSO) between 2.14 and 2.87 observed at 6.6 km/s\nresolution with VLT/UVES, we detect 35 OVI absorption-line systems lying within\n8000 km/s of z(QSO). The systems can be categorized into 9 strong and 26 weak\nOVI absorbers. The strong absorbers are defined by the presence of either\nbroad, fully saturated OVI absorption or partial coverage of the continuum\nsource, and have log N(OVI)>~15.0; these systems are intrinsic to the AGN. The\nweak (narrow) systems show no partial coverage or saturation, and are\ncharacterized by log N(OVI)<14.5 and have a median total velocity width of only\n42 km/s. The incidence dN/dz of weak OVI systems within 2000 km/s of the quasar\nis 42+/-12. Between 2000 and 8000 km/s, dN/dz falls to 14+/-4, equal to the\nincidence of intervening OVI absorbers. Whereas the accompanying H I and C IV\ncolumn densities are significantly lower (by a mean of ~1 dex) in the weak OVI\nabsorbers within 2000 km/s of z(QSO) than in those at larger velocities, the\nOVI column densities display no dependence on proximity. Furthermore,\nsignificant offsets between the HI and OVI centroids in ~50% of the weak\nabsorbers imply that (at least in these cases) the HI and OVI are not formed in\nthe same phase of gas. In summary, we find no firm evidence that quasar\nradiation influences the OVI-bearing gas, suggesting the OVI is collisionally\nionized rather than photoionized, possibly in the multi-phase halos of\nforeground galaxies. Non-equilibrium collisional ionization models are needed\nto explain the low temperatures in the absorbing gas, which are implied by\nnarrow line widths (b<14 km/s) in over half of the observed OVI components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 15:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
