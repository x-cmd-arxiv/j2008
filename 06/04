Methods: We consider\ncases where the magnetic Reynolds number is either marginal or moderately\nsupercritical with respect to small-scale dynamo action in the absence of shear\nand rotation. The effects of magnetic helicity fluxes are studied by comparing\nresults for the magnetic field with open and closed boundaries. Results:\nWithout shear no large-scale dynamos are found even if the ingredients\nnecessary for the alpha-effect (rotation and stratification) are present in the\nsystem. When uniform horizontal shear is added, a large-scale magnetic field\ndevelops, provided the boundaries are open. In this case the mean magnetic\nfield contains a significant fraction of the total field. For those runs where\nthe magnetic Reynolds number is between 60 and 250, small-scale dynamo is\nexpected to be excited, but the field distribution is found to be similar to\ncases with smaller magnetic Reynolds number where the small-scale dynamo is not\nexcited. In the case of closed (perfectly conducting) boundaries, magnetic\nhelicity fluxes are suppressed and no large-scale fields are found. Similarly,\npoor large-scale field development is seen when vertical shear is used in\ncombination with periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions. If,\nhowever, open (normal-field) boundary conditions are used in the x-direction, a\nlarge-scale field develops. These results support the notion that shear not\nonly helps to generate the field, but it also plays a crucial role in driving\nmagnetic helicity fluxes out of the system along the isocontours of shear,\nthereby allowing efficient dynamo action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2008 18:05:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 16:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-10"}

In this paper we propose a new\nscheme for reconstructing multiband sparse signals using a small number of\nsampling channels. The scheme, which we call synchronous multirate sampling\n(SMRS), entails gathering samples synchronously at few different rates whose\nsum is significantly lower than the Nyquist sampling rate. The signals are\nreconstructed by solving a system of linear equations. We have demonstrated an\naccurate and robust reconstruction of signals using a small number of sampling\nchannels that operate at relatively high rates. Sampling at higher rates\nincreases the signal to noise ratio in samples. The SMRS scheme enables a\nsignificant reduction in the number of channels required when the sampling rate\nincreases. We have demonstrated, using only three sampling channels, an\naccurate sampling and reconstruction of 4 real signals (8 bands). The matrices\nthat are used to reconstruct the signals in the SMRS scheme also have low\ncondition numbers. This indicates that the SMRS scheme is robust to noise in\nsignals. The success of the SMRS scheme relies on the assumption that the\nsampled signals are sparse. As a result most of the sampled spectrum may be\nunaliased in at least one of the sampling channels. This is in contrast to\nmulticoset sampling schemes in which an alias in one channel is equivalent to\nan alias in all channels.

We show how to derive the laws of crack motion either by\nusing solvability conditions in a perturbative treatment for slight departure\nfrom the Griffith threshold, or by generalizing the Eshelby tensor to\nphase-field models. The analysis provides a simple physical interpretation of\nthe second component of the classic Eshelby integral in the limit of vanishing\ncrack propagation velocity: it gives the elastic torque on the crack tip that\nis needed to balance the Herring torque arising from the anisotropic interface\nenergy. This force balance condition reduces in this limit to the principle of\nlocal symmetry in isotropic media and to the principle of maximum energy\nrelease rate for smooth curvilinear cracks in anisotropic media. It can also be\ninterpreted physically in this limit based on energetic considerations in the\ntraditional framework of continuum fracture mechanics, in support of its\ngeneral validity for real systems beyond the scope of phase-field models.\nAnalytical predictions of crack paths in anisotropic media are validated by\nnumerical simulations.

We explore the implementation of these\ntechniques in optical quantum processing and show that linear optical circuits\ncould operate with much higher probabilities of success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2008 22:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is assumed that the\nCR protects the PR transmission by applying the so-called\ninterference-temperature constraint, whereby the CR is allowed to transmit\nregardless of the PR's on/off status provided that the resultant interference\npower level at the PR receiver is kept below some predefined threshold. For the\nfading PR and CR channels, the interference-power constraint at the PR receiver\nis usually one of the following two types: One is to regulate the average\ninterference power (AIP) over all the fading states, while the other is to\nlimit the peak interference power (PIP) at each fading state. From the CR's\nperspective, given the same average and peak power threshold, the AIP\nconstraint is more favorable than the PIP counterpart because of its more\nflexibility for dynamically allocating transmit powers over the fading states.\nOn the contrary, from the perspective of protecting the PR, the more\nrestrictive PIP constraint appears at a first glance to be a better option than\nthe AIP. Some surprisingly, this paper shows that in terms of various forms of\ncapacity limits achievable for the PR fading channel, e.g., the ergodic and\noutage capacities, the AIP constraint is also superior over the PIP. This\nresult is based upon an interesting interference diversity phenomenon, i.e.,\nrandomized interference powers over the fading states in the AIP case are more\nadvantageous over deterministic ones in the PIP case for minimizing the\nresultant PR capacity losses. Therefore, the AIP constraint results in larger\nfading channel capacities than the PIP for both the CR and PR transmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 01:33:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2008 07:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-12"}

The model also\nuses a closure model, the Closure Model with Plumes (CMP hereafter), that takes\nthe asymmetry between the up- and down-flows (i.e. the granules and plumes,\nrespectively) into account.

We run the dynamics on\n$\\L_\\b$ starting from a random initial configuration where all the droplets (=\nclusters of plus-spins, respectively, clusters of particles)are small. For\nlarge $\\b$, and for interaction parameters that correspond to the metastable\nregime, we investigate how the transition from the metastable state (with only\nsmall droplets) to the stable state (with one or more large droplets) takes\nplace under the dynamics. This transition is triggered by the appearance of a\nsingle \\emph{critical droplet} somewhere in $\\L_\\b$. Using potential-theoretic\nmethods, we compute the \\emph{average nucleation time} (= the first time a\ncritical droplet appears and starts growing) up to a multiplicative factor that\ntends to one as $\\b\\to\\infty$. It turns out that this time grows as\n$Ke^{\\Gamma\\b}/|\\L_\\b|$ for Glauber dynamics and $K\\b e^{\\Gamma\\b}/|\\L_\\b|$ for\nKawasaki dynamics, where $\\Gamma$ is the local canonical, respectively,\ngrand-canonical energy to create a critical droplet and $K$ is a constant\nreflecting the geometry of the critical droplet, provided these times tend to\ninfinity (which puts a growth restriction on $|\\L_\\b|$). The fact that the\naverage nucleation time is inversely proportional to $|\\L_\\b|$ is referred to\nas \\emph{homogeneous nucleation}, because it says that the critical droplet for\nthe transition appears essentially independently in small boxes that partition\n$\\L_\\b$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 12:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-05"}

We investigate the question if the present-day data\nare consistent with the assumption that O-stars have formed in groups\n(clusters, associations), or in isolation. Methods: We apply the epicycle\ntheory for back-tracing the orbits of O-type stars and of candidate parent open\nclusters. Results: From the 370 O-stars in the ``Galactic O star catalog v\n2.0'' (GOSV2) we have investigated 93 stars classified as \"field\", and found\nthe origin for 73 of them in 48 open clusters younger than 30 Myrs. Only for 32\nstars or about 9% of all O-stars from this catalogue, the question of their\norigin in groups is not solved; some of them may have originated in isolation\nor may have disintegrated the group in which they formed. Fifty percent of the\nyoung open clusters (age < 30 Myr) in the ``Catalogue of Open Cluster Data''\n(COCD) have O-stars as members, or have ejected at least one O-star in the\nfirst 10 Myrs of their life, or both. During this period the average mass loss\nfrom open clusters by ejecting O-stars is found to be 3 to 5 M_Sun per Myr. We\nprove that zeta Pup had its origin in the open cluster Trumpler 10 which it\nleft about 2.5 Myrs ago, and that its present-day distance is 300 pc (compared\nto 440 pc before).

In this\nmethod the sharp fluid interface is replaced by a thin, yet finite, transition\nlayer where the interfacial forces vary smoothly. This is achieved by\nintroducing an order parameter (the phase field) whose variation is continuous\nacross the interfacial layers and is uniform in the bulk region. The phase\nfield model obeys a Cahn--Hilliard equation and is two-way coupled to the\nstandard Navier--Stokes equations. Starting from this system of equations we\nhave first performed a linear analysis from which we have analytically\nrederived the known gravity-capillary dispersion relation in the limit of\nvanishing mixing energy density and capillary width. We have performed\nnumerical simulations and identified a region of parameters in which the known\nproperties of the linear phase (both stable and unstable) are reproduced in a\nvery accurate way. This has been done both in the case of negligible viscosity\nand in the case of nonzero viscosity. In the latter situation only upper and\nlower bounds for the perturbation growth-rate are known. Finally, we have also\ninvestigated the weakly-nonlinear stage of the perturbation evolution and\nidentified a regime characterized by a constant terminal velocity of\nbubbles/spikes. The measured value of the terminal velocity is in perfect\nagreement with available theoretical prediction. The phase-field approach thus\nappears to be a valuable tecnhique for the dynamical description of the stages\nwhere hydrodynamic turbulence and wave-turbulence enter into play.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 14:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2008 14:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We construct an ad\nhoc modification of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation wherein pressure's\nself-gravity is parameterized by a constant, $\\chi$, with $0 \\le \\chi \\le 1$.\nThe full general relativistic contribution to the gravity of pressure is\nrecovered with $\\chi = 1$, and is eliminated when $\\chi = 0$. This formulation\nis not proposed as an alternative theory of gravity, but is merely used to\nquantify the extent to which the self-gravity of pressure contributes to the\nstructure of dense objects. As can be surmised qualitatively, neutron star\nmasses can be quite sensitive to $\\chi$, with higher values of neutron-star\nmass (by $\\sim$20--25%) allowed for smaller values of $\\chi$. However, for a\ngiven equation of state, neither the range of neutron star radii nor the radii\nat fixed central density depend sensitively on $\\chi$. Over the neutron star\nmass range measured so far, the presence or absence of pressure's self-gravity\nyields a nearly immeasurable change in radius -- much smaller than the\nvariations in radius due to the uncertainty in the equation of state. In\ncontrast to the result for BBN, we thus find that neutron stars are not likely\nto be useful testbeds for examining the self-gravity of pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 15:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-05"}

We investigate the Gibbs\nproperties of systems arising from an initial mean-field Gibbs measure by\napplication of given local transition kernels. This generalizes previous\ncase-studies made for spins taking finitely many values to the first step in\ndirection to a general theory, containing the following parts: (1) A formula\nfor the limiting conditional probability distributions of the transformed\nsystem. It holds both in the Gibbs and non-Gibbs regime and invokes a\nminimization problem for a \"constrained rate-function\". (2) A criterion for\nGibbsianness of the transformed system for initial Lipschitz-Hamiltonians\ninvolving concentration properties of the transition kernels. (3) A continuity\nestimate for the single-site conditional distributions of the transformed\nsystem. While (2) and (3) have provable lattice-counterparts, the\ncharacterization of (1) is stronger in mean-field. As applications we show\nshort-time Gibbsianness of rotator mean-field models on the (q-1)-dimensional\nsphere under diffusive time-evolution and the preservation of Gibbsianness\nunder local coarse-graining of the initial local spin space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 15:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

After introducing the abstract framework, we discuss\nthe massless conformally coupled Klein Gordon field theory, showing that its\nquantization corresponds to a functor between two certain categories. At the\nabstract level, the ordinary fields, could be thought as natural\ntransformations in the sense of category theory. We show that, the Wick\nmonomials without derivatives (Wick powers), can be interpreted as fields in\nthis generalized sense, provided a non trivial choice of the renormalization\nconstants is given. A careful analysis shows that the transformation law of\nWick powers is characterized by a weight, and it turns out that the sum of\nfields with different weights breaks the conformal covariance. At this point\nthere is a difference between the previously given picture due to the presence\nof a bigger group of covariance. It is furthermore shown that the construction\ndoes not depend upon the scale mu appearing in the Hadamard parametrix, used to\nregularize the fields. Finally, we briefly discuss some further examples of\nmore involved fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 15:24:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2009 09:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-12"}
