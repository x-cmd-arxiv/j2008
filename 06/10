Thermal ionization of this hot gas couples the disk to the\nmagnetic field, allowing the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) to generate\nturbulence and transport angular momentum. Further from the central star the\nionization fraction decreases, decoupling the disk from the magnetic field and\nreducing the efficiency of angular momentum transport.

The spherical model follows closely a twisted magnetic\nflux tube Riemannian geometrical model or flux rope in solar physics, presented\npreviously by Ricca [Solar Physics (1997)]. The spherical model presented here\npresent new and interesting feature concerning its connection with spherical\nsteady solar dynamos. One of this new feature is represented by the fact that\nthe by considering poloidal magnetic field component much weaker than its\ntoroidal counterpart, one obtains a stretch dynamo action where the Riemannian\nsolar spherical line element is proportional to differential rotation. This\nresult is obtained also by using the Vainshtein-Zeldovich stretch, twist and\nfold (STF) method to generate dynamos. One notes that for high magnetic\nReynolds of $R{m}=O({10^{7}})$ the dynamo action is present for a corresponding\nsmall stretching factor of $K^{2}=1.6$ where $K^{2}=1$ represents the\nunstretched dynamo. The constant stretched dynamos considered here are shown to\nbe Riemann-flat, where the Riemann curvature tensor vanishes.

For a set of evolving active regions (ARs) observed with {\\it Solar\nand Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)} Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) in the high\nresolution mode, the dissipation spectrum, $k^2E(k)$, and the spatial structure\nof dissipation, i.e., the Stokes dissipation function $\\epsilon(x,y)$, were\ncalculated from the observed $B_z$ component of the magnetic field. These\nfunctions allowed us to calculate (a part of) the horizontal electric current\ndensity in the photosphere. It was shown that as an active region emerges,\nlarge-scale horizontal electric currents are gradually generated and determine\na bulk of dissipation. When an active region decays, the large-scale horizontal\ncurrents decay faster than the small-scale ones. The density of horizontal\ncurrents in active regions is in the range of $<j_h > \\sim (0.008 - 0.028)$\nA/m$^2$, that is compatible with the density of vertical currents in active\nregions. We suggest two possible mechanisms for generation of such horizontal\ncurrents in the photosphere. One of them is the drift motions of charged\nparticles in the medium of varying plasma pressure gradient in a horizontal\nplane at the periphery of a sunspot. Such a drift can produce quasi-circular\nclosed horizontal currents around sunspots. Another possibility could be an\nexistence of horizontal axial current inside a highly twisted horizontal\nmagnetic structure laying in the photosphere along the magnetic neutral line.\nThe horizontal currents may contribute significantly to the dynamics of the\nphotosphere/corona coupling, as well as the estimation of non-potentiality of\nARs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2008 23:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-11"}

DFT shows that the electric dipole transitions do not\ncontribute to the features visible in the pre-edge and provides a clear vision\nof the assignment of the 1s-->3d transitions.

The most relevant factors\ndetermining the dichroism of Cr K pre-edge are identified as the site\ndistortion and 3d-3d electronic repulsion. From this combined DFT, LFM approach\nis concluded that when the pre-edge features are more intense than 4 % of the\nedge jump, pure quadrupole transitions cannot explain alone the origin of the\npre-edge. Finally, the shape of the dichroic signal is more sensitive than the\nisotropic spectrum to the trigonal distortion of the substitutional site.

We discover a remarkable geometry of the minimum energy surface in\nthe N-spin space. The classical ground states, called Cartesian or CN-ground\nstates, whose number grows exponentially with the number of spins N, form a set\nof points in the N-spin space. These points are connected by a network of flat\nvalleys in the N-spin space, giving rise to a continuous family of classical\nground states. Further, the CN-ground states have a correspondence with dimer\ncoverings and with self avoiding walks on a honeycomb lattice. The zero point\nenergy of our spin wave theory picks out a subset from a continuous family of\nclassically degenerate states as the quantum ground states; the number of these\nstates also grows exponentially with N. In the second part, we present some\nexact results. For arbitrary spin-S, we show that localized Z_2 flux\nexcitations are present by constructing plaquette operators with eigenvalues\n\\pm 1 which commute with the Hamiltonian.

Recent observations suggest the\npossibility that the beating results from the Berry-phase pickup by the\nconducting electrons in materials with the strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI).\nIn this study, we also observed beats in the AB oscillations in a gate-defined\nclosed-loop interferometer fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional\nelectron-gas heterostructure. Since this heterostructure has very small SOI,\nthe picture of the Berry-phase pickup is ruled out. The observation of beats in\nthis study, with the controllability of forming a single transverse subband\nmode in both arms of our gate-defined interferometer, also rules out the\noften-claimed multiple transverse subband effect. It is observed that nodes of\nthe beats with an h/2e period exhibit a parabolic distribution for varying the\nside gate. These results are shown to be well interpreted, without resorting to\nthe SOI effect, by the existence of two-dimensional multiple longitudinal modes\nin a single transverse subband. The Fourier spectrum of measured conductance,\ndespite showing multiple h/e peaks with the magnetic-field dependence that are\nvery similar to that from strong-SOI materials, can also be interpreted as the\ntwo-dimensional multiple-longitudinal-modes effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2008 09:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-11"}

In an almost laminar\nregion close to the midplane, the relative velocities of the turbulent\nparticles are comparatively small, which decreases the probability of\ndestructive particle collisions. Second, turbulence is not the only source of\nviolent relative particle velocities, because high radial drift speeds can also\nlead to boulder fragmentation. For this reason, we focus additionally on the\nsnow line. Evaporation fronts can be associated with gas pressure maxima in\nwhich radial drift basically vanishes. This implies that particle fragmentation\nbecomes even less likely. Our simulation results suggest that particles can\novercome the fragmentation barrier.

At larger distances, reflecting the Fanaroff-Riley radio\nsource classification, we observe an abrupt deceleration in FR-I jets while\nrelativistic motions persist up to Mpc scale in FR-II. Moreover, VLBI\nobservations of some object like B2 1144+35, Mrk501 and M87 show limb\nbrightening of the jet radio emission at the parsec scale. This effect is\ninterpreted kinematically as due to the presence of a deboosted central spine\nat high Lorentz factor and of a weakly relativistic external layer. In this\npaper we investigate whether these effects can be interpreted by a breaking of\nthe collimated flow by external medium entrainment favored by shear\ninstabilities, namely Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.

We study how the collapse of gas\nclouds is altered by the addition of metals to the star-forming environment by\nperforming a series of simulations of pre-enriched star formation at various\nmetallicities. For metallicities below the critical metallicity, Z_cr, collapse\nproceeds similarly to the metal-free case, and only massive objects form. For\nmetallicities well above Z_cr, efficient cooling rapidly lowers the gas\ntemperature to the temperature of the CMB. The gas is unable to radiatively\ncool below the CMB temperature, and becomes thermally stable. For high\nmetallicities, Z >= 10^-2.5 Zsun, this occurs early in the evolution of the gas\ncloud, when the density is still relatively low. The resulting cloud-cores show\nlittle or no fragmentation, and would most likely form massive stars. If the\nmetallicity is not vastly above Z_cr, the cloud cools efficiently but does not\nreach the CMB temperature, and fragmentation into multiple objects occurs. We\nconclude that there were three distinct modes of star formation at high\nredshift (z >= 4): a `primordial' mode, producing massive stars (10s to 100s\nMsun) at very low metallicities (Z <= 10^-3.75 Zsun); a CMB-regulated mode,\nproducing moderate mass (10s of Msun) stars at high metallicites (Z >= 10^-2.5\nZsun at redshift z ~ 15-20); and a low-mass (a few Msun) mode existing between\nthose two metallicities. As the universe ages and the CMB temperature\ndecreases, the range of the low mass mode extends to higher metallicities,\neventually becoming the only mode of star formation.

For the undoped samples, strong Hall effect and magnetoresistance with\nstrong temperature dependence were found below about 150 K. The\nmagnetoresistance was found to be as large as 30% at 15 K at a magnetic field\nof 9 T. From the transport data we found that the transition near 155 K was\naccomplished in two steps: first one occurs at 155 K which may be associated\nwith the structural transition, the second one takes place at about 140 K which\nmay correspond to the spin-density wave like transition. In the superconducting\nsample with $T_c$ = 50 $ $K, it is found that the Hall coefficient also reveals\na strong temperature dependence with a negative sign. But the magnetoresistance\nbecomes very weak and does not satisfy the Kohler's scaling law. These\ndilemmatic results (strong Hall effect and very weak magnetoresistance) prevent\nto understand the normal state electric conduction by a simple multi-band model\nby taking account the electron and hole pockets.

It is commonly regarded as genuinely quantum\nand essentially paradoxical. Although a common approach to teleportation\namongst physicists nowadays is a somewhat operational one, some researchers are\nmaking an effort to deflate the above views.\n  On the one hand, it was recently argued that the paradox of information\ntransfer taking place in teleportation is dissolved (Timpson, 2006) by\nappealing the very notion of information. On the other hand, it was\ndemonstrated that some classical versions of teleportation retain its important\nfeatures, which hitherto were considered genuinely quantum (Cohen, 2003;\nCollins&Popescu, 2002; Hardy, 1999; Mor, 2006; Spekkens, 2007).\n  I will present a special version of a quantum teleportation protocol which is\nin a sense split into classical and quantum steps. This description provides us\nwith a unified picture of teleportation in both domains. It will be explicitly\nshown how classical teleportation is embedded in the quantum protocol.\nMoreover, the classical step can be successfully accomplished even if the state\nshared by the parties is completely disentangled [this is consistent with the\nresult obtained in (Wang, 2005)]. Yet, all the (apparent) paradoxical features\nusually associated with quantum teleportation are clearly present in this step.\nIn particular, this demonstrates that entanglement cannot be ultimately\nresponsible and not necessary for the (paradoxical?) information transfer.\n  Thus, even if one considers teleportation as mysterious, all its mysteries\nare shifted from quantum domain into purely classical one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2008 14:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-11"}

Surprisingly, many-body effects have been found to increase at\nsodium-rich compositions of NaxCoO2 where one expects a simple, nearly free\nmotion of the dilute S=1/2 holes doped into a band insulator NaCoO2. Here we\ndiscuss the origin of enigmatic correlations that turn a doped NaCoO2 into a\nstrongly correlated electronic system. A minimal model including orbital\ndegeneracy is proposed and its predictions are discussed. The model is based on\na key property of cobalt oxides - the spin-state quasidegeneracy of CoO6\noctahedral complex - which has been known, e.g., in the context of an unusual\nphysics of LaCoO3 compound. Another important ingredient of the model is the\n90-degree Co-O-Co bonding in NaxCoO2 which allows nearest-neighbor $t_{2g}-e_g$\nhopping. This hopping introduces a dynamical mixture of electronic\nconfigurations $t_{2g}^6, S=0$ and $t_{2g}^5e_g^1, S=1$ of neighboring cobalt\nions. We show that scattering of charge carriers on spin-state fluctuations\nsuppresses their coherent motion and leads to the spin-polaron physics at\n$x\\sim 1$. At larger doping when coherent fermionic bands are formed, the model\npredicts singlet superconductivity of extended s-wave symmetry.

For a purpose of comparison, we also consider the homogeneous and\n$r^{-1}$ profiles for dark matter in a truncated spherical halo. Assuming for\nsimplicity that the dark matter distribution is not affected by mass loss from\ndiscs and the change of baryonic disc matter distribution is homologous, we\nevaluate the effects of dynamical response in the resulting discs. We found\nthat the dynamical response only for an adiabatic approximation of mass loss\ncan simultaneously account for the rotation velocity and disc size as observed\nparticularly in dwarf spiral galaxies, thus reproducing the Tully-Fisher\nrelation and the size versus magnitude relation over the full range of\nmagnitude. Furthermore, we found that the mean specific angular momentum in\ndiscs after the mass loss becomes larger than that before the mass loss,\nsuggesting that the mass loss would occur most likely from the central disc\nregion where the specific angular momentum is low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2008 15:12:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Aug 2008 17:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
