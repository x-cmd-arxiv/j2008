In this letter, we present\ndirect measurements of the saturation length performed in a wind tunnel\nexperiment.

Using the linear\nstability analysis of dune formation, it is then possible to deduce the\nsaturation length from field data.

This extraction has two steps: segmentation and splitting.\nFor the segmentation step, if there is a sufficient contrast between the\ndifferent components, a classical threshold procedure followed by a succession\nof morphological filters can be applied. If not, and if the boundary needs to\nbe localized precisely, a watershed transformation controlled by labels is\napplied. The basement of this transformation is to localize a label included in\nthe component and another label in the component complementary. A \"soft\"\nthreshold following by an opening is applied on the initial image to localize a\nlabel in a component. For any segmentation procedure, the visualisation shows a\nproblem: some groups of two grains, close one to each other, become connected.\nSo if a classical cluster procedure is applied on the segmented binary image,\nthese numerical connected grains are considered as a single grain. To overcome\nthis problem, we applied a procedure introduced by L. Vincent in 1993.

The Athena results agree well with similar studies that used different\nnumerical algorithms. We conduct analyses to study the flow of energy from\ndifferential rotation to turbulent fluctuations to thermalization. A study of\nthe temporal correlation between the time derivatives of volume-averaged energy\ncomponents shows that energy injected into turbulent fluctuations dissipates on\na timescale of $\\Omega^{-1}$, where $\\Omega$ is the orbital frequency of the\nlocal domain. Magnetic dissipation dominates over kinetic dissipation, although\nnot by as great a factor as the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy. We\nFourier-transform the magnetic and kinetic energy evolution equations and,\nusing the assumption that the time-averaged energies are constant, determine\nthe level of numerical dissipation as a function of length scale and\nresolution. By modeling numerical dissipation as if it were physical in origin,\nwe characterize numerical resistivity and viscosity in terms of effective\nReynolds and Prandtl numbers. The resulting effective magnetic Prandtl number\nis $\\sim 2$, independent of resolution or initial field geometry. MRI\nsimulations with effective Reynolds and Prandtl numbers determined by numerical\ndissipation are not equivalent to those where these numbers are set by physical\nresistivity and viscosity. These results serve, then, as a baseline for future\nshearing box studies where dissipation is controlled by the inclusion of\nexplicit viscosity and resistivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2008 20:03:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2008 20:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

With a\ndynamical temperature, given by the mean kinetic energy of the cluster stars,\nand a dynamical luminosity, which is defined as the kinetic energy of the stars\nleaving the cluster in analogy to the energy of photons emitted by a star, the\ndissolution of star clusters is studied using a new dynamical\ntemperature-luminosity diagram for star clusters. The investigation contains a\nparameter-space study of open clusters of up to N = 32768 single-mass stars\nwith different initial density distributions, half-mass radii, tidal conditions\nand binary fractions. The clusters show a strong correlation between dynamical\ntemperature and dynamical luminosity and most of the investigated cluster\nfamilies share a common sequence in such a dynamical temperature-luminosity\ndiagram. Deviations from this sequence are analyzed and discussed. After core\ncollapse, the position of a cluster within this diagram can be defined by three\nparameters: the mass, the tidal conditions and the binary fraction. Due to core\ncollapse all initial conditions are lost and the remaining stars adjust to the\ngiven tidal conditions. Binaries as internal energy sources influence this\nadjustment. A further finding concerns the Lagrange radii of star clusters:\nThroughout the investigated parameter space nearly all clusters show a constant\nhalf-mass radius for the time after core collapse until dissolution.\nFurthermore, the ratio of half-mass radius to tidal radius evolves onto a\ncommon sequence which only depends on the mass left in the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2008 20:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The FP 'tilt' implies lower-mass ellipticals have a higher ratio\nof stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii. Models argue\nthat mergers between more gas-rich (typically lower-mass) disks yield larger\nmass fractions formed in compact starbursts, giving a smaller stellar R_e and\nhigher M_stellar/M_tot within that R_e. Such starbursts leave a characteristic\nimprint in the surface brightness profile: a central excess above an outer\nprofile established by the dissipationless violent relaxation of disk stars. In\nprevious work, we developed empirical methods to decompose the observed\nprofiles of ellipticals and robustly estimate the amount of dissipation in the\noriginal spheroid-forming merger(s). Applying this to a large sample of\nobserved ellipticals, we test whether or not their location on the FP and its\ntilt are driven by dissipation. At fixed mass, ellipticals formed in more\ndissipational events are smaller and have higher M_stellar/M_tot. At fixed\ndegree of dissipation, there is no tilt in the FP. We show that the dynamical\nmass estimator R_e*sigma^2/G is a good estimator of the true mass: the observed\nFP tilt cannot primarily owe to other forms of non-homology. Removing the\neffects of dissipation, observed ellipticals obey the same FP correlations as\ndisks: unusual progenitors are not required to make typical ellipticals.\nDissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the FP tilt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2008 20:08:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2008 00:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

While this is an effective estimation\nstrategy, it tempts the practitioner to ignore the role of the stimulus and the\nmeaning of mutual information. We show here that, as the number of trials\nincreases indefinitely, the direct (or ``plug-in'') estimate of marginal\nentropy converges (with probability 1) to the entropy of the time-averaged\nconditional distribution of the response, and the direct estimate of the\nconditional entropy converges to the time-averaged entropy of the conditional\ndistribution of the response. Under joint stationarity and ergodicity of the\nresponse and stimulus, the difference of these quantities converges to the\nmutual information. When the stimulus is deterministic or non-stationary the\ndirect estimate of information no longer estimates mutual information, which is\nno longer meaningful, but it remains a measure of variability of the response\ndistribution across time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2008 20:13:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2008 23:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-19"}

The aim is to assign computational resources\nwhere and when they matter most for maintaining or improving the predictive\npower of the algorithm, onto specific tumor areas and at particular times.\nUsing a previously described 2D brain tumor model, we have developed four\ndifferent computational methods for achieving the multi-resolution scheme,\nthree of which are designed to dynamically train on the high-resolution\nsimulation that serves as control. To quantify the algorithms' performance, we\nrank them by weighing the distinct computational time savings of the simulation\nruns versus the methods' ability to accurately reproduce the high-resolution\nresults of the control.

In the framework of a recently developed\nformalism with variable brane tension one can pose the question, whether it was\nalways that high? In analogy with fluid membranes, in this paper we allow for\ntemperature dependent brane tension, according to the corresponding law\nestablished by E\\\"otv\\\"os. For cosmological branes this assumption leads to\nseveral immediate consequences: (a) The brane Universe was created at a finite\ntemperature $T_{c}$ and scale factor $a_{\\min}$. (b) Both the brane tension and\nthe 4-dimensional gravitational coupling 'constant' increase with the scale\nfactor from zero to asymptotic values. (c) The 4-dimensional cosmological\n'constant' evolves with $a$, starting with a huge negative value, passing\nthrough zero, finally reaching a small positive value. Such a scale-factor\ndependent cosmological constant is able to generate a surplus of attraction at\nsmall $a$ (as dark matter does) and a late-time repulsion at large $a$ (dark\nenergy). In the particular toy model discussed here the evolution of the brane\ntension is compensated by energy interchange between the brane and the fifth\ndimension, such that the continuity equation holds for the cosmological fluid.\nThe resulting cosmology closely mimics the standard model at late times, a\ndecelerated phase being followed by an accelerated expansion. The energy\nabsorption of the brane drives the 5D space-time towards maximal symmetry,\nbecoming Anti de Sitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2008 01:02:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 12:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The Kodaira-Spencer classes\non the Jacobian are invariant under the action of the group. Thus they form a\nbasis of Kodaira-Spencer classes on the CY manifold. Since the bracket of any\nKodaira-Spencer classes on the Jacobian are zero, then they will be zero on the\nCY manifold.

We thus aim at performing computations of\ncompositionally inhomogeneous aggregates composed of irregularly shaped\nconstituents. In addition we aim at developing an empirical recipe to compute\nthe optical properties of such aggregates in a fast and accurate manner. We\nperformed CDA computations for aggregates of irregularly shaped particles with\nvarious compositions.

Using specific simulations, we test this approach and\ncompare it to other published approaches. We show that convolution in shapelet\nspace leads to a shapelet model of order $n_{max}^h = n_{max}^g + n_{max}^f$\nwith $n_{max}^f$ and $n_{max}^g$ being the maximum orders of the intrinsic\ngalaxy and the PSF models, respectively. Deconvolution is hence a\ntransformation which maps a certain number of convolved coefficients onto a\ngenerally smaller number of deconvolved coefficients.

Methods: We obtained high accuracy\ninterferometric observations in the infrared K' band, using the CHARA/FLUOR\ninstrument. We then computed evolutionary models of 61 Cyg A & B with the\nCESAM2k code. As model constraints, we used a combination of observational\nparameters from classical observation methods (photometry, spectroscopy) as\nwell as our new interferometric radii.

According to previous studies, while gas drag can\nreduce the $\\triangle V$ between bodies of the same sizes by forcing orbital\nalignment to planetesimals, it increases the $\\triangle V$ among bodies of\ndifferent sizes. In this paper, focusing on the $\\gamma$ Cephei binary system,\nwe propose a mechanism that can overcome this difficulty. We show that in a\ndissipating gas disk (with a typical dissipating timescale of $\\sim 10^5-10^6$\nyears), all the planetesimals eventually converge towards the same forced\norbits regardless of their sizes, leading to much lower impact velocities among\nthem. These $\\triangle V$ decrease processes progressively increase net mass\naccretion and even trigger runaway growth for large bodies (radius $>15$ km).\nThe effect of size distribution of planetesimals is discussed, and found to be\none of the dominant factors that determine the outcome of collisional\nevolution. Anyway, it can be concluded that by including the gas dissipation in\nthe early stage of disk evolution, the conditions for planetesimal accretion\nbecome much better, and the process from planetesimal to planet-embryo can be\ncarried out in close binary systems like $\\gamma$ Cephei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2008 12:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25"}

It typically involves a large number of variables\nand a cost function depending on these variables. Optimization problems in the\nNP-complete class are particularly difficult, it is believed that the number of\noperations required to minimize the cost function is in the most difficult\ncases exponential in the system size. However, even in an NP-complete problem\nthe practically arising instances might, in fact, be easy to solve. The\nprincipal question we address in this thesis is: How to recognize if an\nNP-complete constraint satisfaction problem is typically hard and what are the\nmain reasons for this? We adopt approaches from the statistical physics of\ndisordered systems, in particular the cavity method developed originally to\ndescribe glassy systems. We describe new properties of the space of solutions\nin two of the most studied constraint satisfaction problems - random\nsatisfiability and random graph coloring. We suggest a relation between the\nexistence of the so-called frozen variables and the algorithmic hardness of a\nproblem. Based on these insights, we introduce a new class of problems which we\nnamed \"locked\" constraint satisfaction, where the statistical description is\neasily solvable, but from the algorithmic point of view they are even more\nchallenging than the canonical satisfiability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2008 14:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-08"}

The protostellar evolution is followed starting from small\ninitial cores until their arrival at the stage of the Zero-Age Main Sequence\n(ZAMS) stars. An emphasis is put on evolutionary features different from those\nwith a low accretion rate of 10^-5 M_sun/yr, which is presumed in the standard\nscenario for low-mass star formation. With the high accretion rate of 10^-3\nM_sun/yr, the protostellar radius becomes very large and exceeds 100 R_sun. It\nis not until the stellar mass reaches 40 M_sun that hydrogen burning begins and\nthe protostar reaches the ZAMS phase, and this ZAMS arrival mass increases with\nthe accretion rate. At a very high accretion rate of > 3 x 10^-3 M_sun/yr, the\ntotal luminosity of the protostar becomes so high that the resultant radiation\npressure inhibits the growth of the protostars under steady accretion before\nreaching the ZAMS stage. Therefore, the evolution under the critical accretion\nrate 3 x 10^-3 M_sun/yr gives the upper mass limit of possible\npre-main-sequence stars at 60 M_sun. The upper mass limit of MS stars is also\nset by the radiation pressure onto the dusty envelope under the same accretion\nrate at 250 M_sun.

Here, we first recall that according to quantum field theory ideas\ngravitation is described by a Lagrangian theory of a possible massive graviton\nfield (generated by matter fields and coupling also to itself) living in\nMinkowski spacetime. The graviton field is moreover supposed to be represented\nby a symmetric tensor field h carrying the representations of spin two and zero\nof the Lorentz group. Such a field, then (as it is well known), must\nnecessarily satisfy the gauge condition given by Eq.(3) below. Next, we\nintroduce an ansatz relating h to the 1-form fields g^a. Then, using the\nClifford bundle formalism we derive, from our Lagrangian theory, the exact wave\nequation for the graviton and investigate the role of the gauge condition given\nby Eq.(3) in obtaining a reliable conservation law for the energy-momentum\ntensor of the gravitational plus the matter fields in Minkowski spacetime.\nFinally we ask the question: does Eq.(3) fix any gauge condition for the field\ng of the effective Lorentzian spacetime structure that represents the field h\nin our theory? We show that no gauge condition is fixed a priory, as is the\ncase in General Relativity. Moreover we investigate under which conditions we\nmay fix Logunov gauge condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2008 15:29:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 19:27:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2009 17:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 17:34:26 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 20:26:05 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 13:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-15"}

We show that satisfiability over\ntransitive frames for the hybrid language extended with the downarrow operator\nis NEXPTIME-complete. This is in contrast to undecidability of satisfiability\nover arbitrary frames for this language (Areces, Blackburn, Marx 1999). It is\nalso shown that adding the @ operator or the past modality leads to\nundecidability over transitive frames. This is again in contrast to the case of\ntransitive trees and linear frames, where we show these languages to be\nnonelementarily decidable. Moreover, we establish 2EXPTIME and EXPTIME upper\nbounds for satisfiability over transitive frames and transitive trees,\nrespectively, for the hybrid Until/Since language. An EXPTIME lower bound is\nshown to hold for the modal Until language over both frame classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2008 15:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

We found new X-ray binary pulsars\nwith periods of 202 s (XMMU J005929.0-723703), 342 s (XMMU J005403.8-722632),\n645 s (XMMU J005535.2-722906) and 325 s (XMMU J005252.1-721715), in the latter\ncase confirming the independent discovery in Chandra data. In addition we\ndetected sixteen known Be/X-ray binary pulsars and six ROSAT-classified\ncandidate high mass X-ray binaries. From one of the candidates, RX\nJ0058.2-7231, we discovered X-ray pulsations with a period of 291 s which makes\nit the likely counterpart of XTE J0051-727. From the known pulsars, we revise\nthe pulse period of CXOU J010206.6-714115 to 967 s, and we detected the 18.37 s\npulsar XTE J0055-727 (= XMM J004911.4-724939) in outburst, which allowed us to\nlocalise the source. The pulse profiles of the X-ray pulsars show a large\nvariety of shapes from smooth to highly structured patterns and differing\nenergy dependence. For all the candidate high mass X-ray binaries optical\ncounterparts can be identified with magnitudes and colours consistent with Be\nstars. Twenty of the Be/X-ray binaries were detected with X-ray luminosities in\nthe range 1.5x10^35 erg/s - 5.5x10^36 erg/s. The majority of the spectra is\nwell represented by an absorbed power-law with an average power-law index of\n0.93. The absorption (in addition to the Galactic foreground value) varies over\na wide range between a few 10^20 H cm^-2 and several 10^22 H cm^-2. An overall\ncorrelation of the absorption with the total SMC HI column density suggests\nthat the absorption seen in the X-ray spectra is often largely caused by\ninterstellar gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2008 15:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We develop a new `irrevocable' heuristic for this\nproblem. In particular, we do not allow recourse to arms that were pulled at\nsome point in the past but then discarded. This irrevocable property is highly\ndesirable from a practical perspective. As a consequence of this property, our\nheuristic entails a minimum amount of `exploration'. At the same time, we find\nthat the price of irrevocability is limited for a broad useful class of bandits\nwe characterize precisely. This class includes one of the most common\napplications of the bandit model, namely, bandits whose arms are `coins' of\nunknown biases. Computational experiments with a generative family of large\nscale problems within this class indicate losses of up to 5 to 10% relative to\nan upper bound on the performance of an optimal policy with no restrictions on\nexploration. We also provide a worst-case theoretical analysis that shows that\nfor this class of bandit problems, the price of irrevocability is uniformly\nbounded: our heuristic earns expected rewards that are always within a factor\nof 1/8 of an optimal policy with no restrictions on exploration. In addition to\nbeing an indicator of robustness across all parameter regimes, this analysis\nsheds light on the structural properties that afford a low price of\nirrevocability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2008 15:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-26"}

It is attributed either to incoherent Cooper pairing setting\nin above the superconducting transition temperature Tc, or to a hidden order\nparameter competing with superconductivity. Here we use inelastic neutron\nscattering from underdoped YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6.6) to show that the dispersion\nrelations of spin excitations in the superconducting and pseudogap states are\nqualitatively different. Specifically, the extensively studied \"hour glass\"\nshape of the magnetic dispersions in the superconducting state is no longer\ndiscernible in the pseudogap state and we observe an unusual \"vertical\"\ndispersion with pronounced in-plane anisotropy. The differences between\nsuperconducting and pseudogap states are thus more profound than generally\nbelieved, suggesting a competition between these two states. Whereas the\nhigh-energy excitations are common to both states and obey the symmetry of the\ncopper oxide square lattice, the low-energy excitations in the pseudogap state\nmay be indicative of collective fluctuations towards a state with broken\norientational symmetry predicted in theoretical work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2008 15:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-26"}
