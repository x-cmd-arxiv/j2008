In a viscous regime at low fields the wall moves rigidly\nwith a velocity proportional to the field. Above a critical field the viscous\nmotion breaks down giving way to oscillations accompanied by a slow drift of\nthe wall. At still higher fields the drift velocity starts rising with the\nfield again but with a much lower mobility dv/dH than in the viscous regime. To\ndescribe the dynamics of the wall we use the method of collective coordinates\nthat focuses on soft modes of the system. By retaining two soft modes,\nparametrized by the coordinates of the vortex core, we obtain a simple\ndescription of the wall dynamics at low and intermediate applied fields that\ndescribes both the viscous and oscillatory regimes below and above the\nbreakdown. The calculated dynamics agrees well with micromagnetic simulations\nat low and intermediate values of the driving field. In higher fields,\nadditional modes become soft and the two-mode approximation is no longer\nsufficient. We explain some of the significant features of vortex domain wall\nmotion in high fields through the inclusion of additional modes associated with\nthe half-antivortices on the strip edge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2008 19:46:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2008 21:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-16"}

Using first-principles full-potential\nelectronic structure calculations, we investigate this sensitive dependence,\ncontrasting in particular LaOFeAs and LaOFeP. The width of the Fe-bands is\nsignificantly larger for LaOFeP, indicating a better metal and weaker\nelectronic correlations. When calculated at their experimental crystal\nstructure these two materials have significantly different low-energy band\nstructure. The topology of the Fermi surface changes when going from LaOFeP to\nLaOFeAs, with a three-dimensional hole pocket present in the former case\ntransforming into a tube with two-dimensional dispersion. We show that the\nlow-energy band structure of LaOFeAs evolves towards that of LaOFeP as the As\natom is lowered closer to the Fe plane with respect to its experimental\nposition. The physical origin of this sensitivity to the iron-pnictogen\ndistance is the covalency of the iron-pnictogen bond, leading to strong\nhybridization effects. To illustrate this, we construct Wannier functions,\nwhich are found to have a large spatial extension when the energy window is\nrestricted to the bands with dominant iron character. Finally, we show that the\nFe bandwidth slightly increases as one moves along the rare-earth series in\nReOFeAs and discuss the physical origin of this effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2008 16:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The hopping and the hybridization parameters\nbetween the Fe $d$ and As $s$ and $p$-orbitals are obtained by fitting the\nresults of our density-functional-theory calculations to a tight-binding model\nwith nearest-neighbor interactions and a minimal orbital basis.

Despite its universality,\nthe physical origin of this profile has not yet been well understood.\nSemi--analytic models by Barnes et al. (2005) have suggested that the density\nstructure of dark matter halos is determined by the onset of the radial orbit\ninstability (ROI). We have tested this hypothesis using N-body simulations of\ncollapsing dark matter halos with a variety of initial conditions. For\ndynamically cold initial conditions, the resulting halo structures are triaxial\nin shape, due to the mild aspect of the instability. We examine how variations\nin initial velocity dispersion affect the onset of the instability, and find\nthat an isotropic velocity dispersion can suppress the ROI entirely, while a\npurely radial dispersion does not. The quantity sigma^2/vc^2 is a criterion for\ninstability, where regions with sigma^2/vc^2 <~1 become triaxial due to the ROI\nor other perturbations. We also find that the radial orbit instability sets a\nscale length at which the velocity dispersion changes rapidly from isotropic to\nradially anisotropic. This scale length is proportional to the radius at which\nthe density profile changes shape, as is the case in the semi--analytic models;\nhowever, the coefficient of proportionality is different by a factor of ~2.5.\nWe conclude that the radial orbit instability is likely to be a key physical\nmechanism responsible for the nearly universal profiles of simulated dark\nmatter halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2008 19:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This\nphenomenon known as nuclear multifragmentation was under intensive\ninvestigation last 20 years. It was established that multifragmentation is an\nuniversal process taking place in all reactions when the excitation energy\ntransferred to nuclei is high enough, more than 3 MeV per nucleon,\nindependently on the initial dynamical stage of the reactions. Very known\ncompound nucleus decay processes (sequential evaporation and fission), which\nare usual for low energies, disappear and multifragmentation dominates at high\nexcitation energy. For this reason, calculation of multifragmentation must be\ncarried on in all cases when production of highly excited nuclei is expected,\nincluding spallation reactions. From the other hand, one can consider\nmultifragmentation as manifestation of the liquid-gas phase transition in\nfinite nuclei. This gives way for studying nuclear matter at subnuclear\ndensities and for applications of properties of nuclear matter extracted from\nmultifragmentation reactions in astrophysics. In this contribution, the\nStatistical Multifragmentation Model (SMM), which combines the compound nucleus\nprocesses at low energies and multifragmentation at high energies, is\ndescribed.

Existence of the energy minimizer has been known\nin literature for some time but it was only recently when the Thomas-Fermi\napproximation was rigorously justified. The spectrum of linearization of the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation at the ground state consists of an unbounded sequence\nof positive eigenvalues. We analyze convergence of eigenvalues in the\nhydrodynamics limit. Convergence in norm of the resolvent operator is proved\nand the convergence rate is estimated. We also study asymptotic and numerical\napproximations of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues using Airy functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jun 2008 15:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-24"}
