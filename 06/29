Rather than\ntwo-dimensional rotation curves, we observe complete velocity fields by placing\nthree adjacent and parallel FORS2 MXU slits on each object, yielding several\nemission and absorption lines. The gas velocity fields are reconstructed and\ndecomposed into circular rotation and irregular motions using kinemetry. To\nquantify irregularities in the gas kinematics, we define three parameters:\nsigma_{PA} (standard deviation of the kinematic position angle), Delta phi (the\naverage misalignment between kinematic and photometric position angles) and\nk_{3,5} (squared sum of the higher order Fourier terms). Using local,\nundistorted galaxies from SINGS, these can be used to establish the regularity\nof the gas velocity fields. Here we present the analysis of 22 distant galaxies\nin the MS0451.6-0305 field with 11 members at z=0.54. In this sample we find\nboth field (4 out of 8) and cluster (3 out of 4) galaxies with velocity fields\nthat are both irregular and asymmetric. We show that these fractions are\nunderestimates of the actual number of galaxies with irregular velocity fields.\nThe values of the (ir)regularity parameters for cluster galaxies are not very\ndifferent from those of the field galaxies, implying that there are isolated\nfield galaxies that are as distorted as the cluster members. None of the\ndeviations in our small sample correlate with photometric/structural properties\nlike luminosity or disk scale length in a significant way.\n  Our 3D-spectroscopic method successfully maps the velocity field of distant\ngalaxies, enabling the importance and efficiency of cluster specific\ninteractions to be assessed quantitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2008 18:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

An example of such\nsystems are tunnel junctions -- single-barrier planar junctions or more complex\nones. In this review we present and discuss recent theoretical results on\nelectron and spin transport through ferromagnetic mesoscopic junctions\nincluding two or more barriers. Such systems are also called ferromagnetic\nsingle-electron transistors. We start from the situation when the central part\nof a device has the form of a magnetic (or nonmagnetic) metallic nanoparticle.\nTransport characteristics reveal then single-electron charging effects,\nincluding the Coulomb staircase, Coulomb blockade, and Coulomb oscillations.\nSingle-electron ferromagnetic transistors based on semiconductor quantum dots\nand large molecules (especially carbon nanotubes) are also considered. The main\nemphasis is placed on the spin effects due to spin-dependent tunnelling through\nthe barriers, which gives rise to spin accumulation and tunnel\nmagnetoresistance. Spin effects also occur in the current-voltage\ncharacteristics, (differential) conductance, shot noise, and others. Transport\ncharacteristics in the two limiting situations of weak and strong coupling are\nof particular interest. In the former case we distinguish between the\nsequential tunnelling and cotunneling regimes. In the strong coupling regime we\nconcentrate on the Kondo phenomenon, which in the case of transport through\nquantum dots or molecules leads to an enhanced conductance and to a pronounced\nzero-bias Kondo peak in the differential conductance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2008 19:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

I use the criterion that the\nfeedback cycle period must be longer than the radiative cooling time of dense\nblobs for large quantities of gas to cool to low temperature. The falling time\nof the dense blobs is parameterized by the ratio of the infall velocity to the\nsound speed. Another parameter is the ratio of the blobs' density to that of\nthe surrounding ICM. By taking the values of the parameters as in previous\npapers on the cold feedback model, I derive an expression that gives the right\nvalue of the entropy threshold.

For $N$ subject to the $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry, we find that\nneutrinos show the normal mass hierarchy and obtain the general phase structure\nthat contains only two phases which arise from $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry breaking\nterms. To perform similar consideration for $N$ blind to the $\\mu-\\tau$\nsymmetry necessarily giving the inverted mass hierarchy, we assume the same\nphase structure. Our phases consist of six phases that need to take care of\ngeneric phases of flavor neutrino masses, from which one can obtain one Dirac\nphase and one Majorana phase as observable phases (because one neutrino is\nmassless). The Dirac CP violating phase $\\delta_{CP}(=\\delta+\\rho)$ depends on\nthe $\\nu_e-\\nu_{\\tau}$ ($\\nu_e-\\nu_{\\mu}$) mixing phase $\\delta$ ($\\rho$). The\nMajorana CP violating phase is suppressed because it depend on $\\rho$, which is\nfound to be associated with almost real quantity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2008 15:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-01"}
