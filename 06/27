Within the latter, the very concepts of geometry and gravitational\ninteraction are not seen as elementary aspects of Nature but rather as\ncollective phenomena associated to the dynamics of more fundamental objects. In\nthis paper we want to further explore this possibility by proposing a model of\nemergent Lorentzian signature and scalar gravity. Assuming that the dynamics of\nthe fundamental objects can give rise in first place to a Riemannian manifold\nand a set of scalar fields we show how time (in the sense of hyperbolic\nequations) can emerge as a property of perturbations dynamics around some\nspecific class of solutions of the field equations. Moreover, we show that\nthese perturbations can give rise to a spin-0 gravity via a suitable\nredefinition of the fields that identifies the relevant degrees of freedom. In\nparticular, we find that our model gives rise to Nordstrom gravity. Since this\ntheory is invariant under general coordinate transformations, this also shows\nhow diffeomorphism invariance (albeit of a weaker form than the one of general\nrelativity) can emerge from much simpler systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 18:46:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 11:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-08"}

However, the spatial isotropy of the FRW Universe\nis not compatible with the presence of large-scale magnetic fields. Therefore,\nin this article we use the general-relativistic (GR) version of the\n(linearized) perturbed magnetohydrodynamic equations with and without\nresistivity, to discuss a generalized Jeans criterion and the potential\nformation of density condensations within a class of homogeneous and\nanisotropically expanding, self-gravitating, magnetized fluids in curved\nspace-time.

On the other hand, in a\nresistive medium, the critical wave-numbers so obtained, exhibit a delicate\ndependence on resistivity, resulting in the reduction of the corresponding\nJeans lengths to smaller scales (well bellow the horizon) than the\nnon-resistive ones, while increasing the range of cosmological models which\nadmit such an instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 19:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

It is also important for finding de Sitter vacua in\nflux compactifications and KKLT scenarios, since failure of the decoupling\ncondition invalidates the implicit assumption that the stabilization and\nuplifting potentials have a low energy supergravity description.\n  We derive a sufficient condition for supersymmetric decoupling, namely, that\nthe Kahler invariant function G = K + log |W|^2 is of the form G = L(light,\n(heavy)) with H and L arbitrary functions, which includes the particular case G\n= L(light) + H(heavy).

Charge-current neutrino reactions lead to the\nformation of a thermally-driven bipolar wind with <$\\dot{M}$> ~10$^{-3}$\nMsun/s, baryon-loading the polar regions, and preventing any production of a\nGRB prior to black-hole formation. The large budget of rotational free energy\nsuggests magneto-rotational effects could produce a much greater polar mass\nloss. We estimate that ~10$^{-4}$ Msun of material with electron fraction in\nthe range 0.1-0.2 become unbound during this SMNS phase as a result of neutrino\nheating. We present a new formalism to compute the $\\nu_i\\bar{\\nu}_i$\nannihilation rate based on moments of the neutrino specific intensity computed\nwith our multi-angle solver. Cumulative annihilation rates, which decay as\n$t^{-1.8}$, decrease over our 100 ms window from a few 10$^{50}$ to ~10$^{49}$\nerg/s, equivalent to a few 10$^{54}$ to ~10$^{53}$ $e^-e^+$ pairs per second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 20:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Most research from the\nalgorithms and numerical linear algebra communities focuses on a variant called\nrank-revealing {\\sf QR}, which seeks a well-conditioned collection of columns\nthat spans the (numerical) range of the matrix. The functional analysis\nliterature contains another strand of work on column selection whose\nalgorithmic implications have not been explored. In particular, a celebrated\nresult of Bourgain and Tzafriri demonstrates that each matrix with normalized\ncolumns contains a large column submatrix that is exceptionally well\nconditioned. Unfortunately, standard proofs of this result cannot be regarded\nas algorithmic.\n  This paper presents a randomized, polynomial-time algorithm that produces the\nsubmatrix promised by Bourgain and Tzafriri. The method involves random\nsampling of columns, followed by a matrix factorization that exposes the\nwell-conditioned subset of columns. This factorization, which is due to\nGrothendieck, is regarded as a central tool in modern functional analysis. The\nprimary novelty in this work is an algorithm, based on eigenvalue minimization,\nfor constructing the Grothendieck factorization. These ideas also result in a\nnovel approximation algorithm for the $(\\infty, 1)$ norm of a matrix, which is\ngenerally {\\sf NP}-hard to compute exactly. As an added bonus, this work\nreveals a surprising connection between matrix factorization and the famous\n{\\sc maxcut} semidefinite program.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 23:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

However, for\nturbulent discs these symmetries only apply to averaged quantities and do not\napply locally. The local asymmetries can induce local imbalances in outflow\npower across the disc mid-plane, which can in turn induce local tilting\ntorques. Here we calculate the effect of the resulting stochastic torques on\ndisc annuli that are a consequence of standard mean field accretion disc\nmodels. The torques induce a random walk of the vector perpendicular to the\nplane of each averaged annulus. This random walk is characterized by a radially\ndependent diffusion coefficient which we calculate for small angle tilt. We use\nthe coefficient to calculate a radially dependent time scale for annular tilt\nand associated jet wobble. The wobble time depends on the square of the wander\nangle so the age of a given system determines the maximum wobble angle. We\napply this to examples of blazars, young stellar objects and binary engines of\npre-planetary nebulae and microquasars. It is noteworthy that for an averaging\ntime $t_w\\sim 3$ days, we estimate a wobble angle for jets in SS433 of\n$\\theta\\sim 0.8$ degrees, not inconsistent with observational data.

Firstly, we study features of the main phase of the flare, when\nthe strongest emissions from microwaves up to 200 MeV gamma-rays were observed.\nSecondly, we relate our results to a long-standing controversy on the origin of\nSEPs arriving at Earth, i.e., acceleration in flares, or shocks ahead of CMEs.\nAll emissions from microwaves up to 2.22 MeV line gamma-rays during the main\nflare phase originated within a compact structure located just above sunspot\numbrae. A huge radio burst with a frequency maximum at 30 GHz was observed,\nindicating the presence of a large number of energetic electrons in strong\nmagnetic fields. Thus, protons and electrons responsible for flare emissions\nduring its main phase were accelerated within the magnetic field of the active\nregion. The leading, impulsive parts of the GLE, and highest-energy gamma-rays\nidentified with pi^0-decay emission, are similar and correspond in time. The\norigin of the pi^0-decay gamma-rays is argued to be the same as that of lower\nenergy emissions. We estimate the sky-plane speed of the CME to be 2000-2600\nkm/s, i.e., high, but of the same order as preceding non-GLE-related CMEs from\nthe same active region. Hence, the flare itself rather than the CME appears to\ndetermine the extreme nature of this event. We conclude that the acceleration,\nat least, to sub-relativistic energies, of electrons and protons, responsible\nfor both the flare emissions and the leading spike of SEP/GLE by 07 UT, are\nlikely to have occurred simultaneously within the flare region. We do not rule\nout a probable contribution from particles accelerated in the CME-driven shock\nfor the leading GLE spike, which seemed to dominate later on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2008 10:47:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 08:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-30"}

However, since it allows mixing of information within the network, a\nsingle corrupted packet generated by a Byzantine attacker can easily\ncontaminate the information to multiple destinations.\n  In this paper, we study the transmission overhead associated with three\ndifferent schemes for detecting Byzantine adversaries at a node using network\ncoding: end-to-end error correction, packet-based Byzantine detection scheme,\nand generation-based Byzantine detection scheme. In end-to-end error\ncorrection, it is known that we can correct up to the min-cut between the\nsource and destinations. However, if we use Byzantine detection schemes, we can\ndetect polluted data, drop them, and therefore, only transmit valid data. For\nthe dropped data, the destinations perform erasure correction, which is\ncomputationally lighter than error correction. We show that, with enough\nattackers present in the network, Byzantine detection schemes may improve the\nthroughput of the network since we choose to forward only reliable information.\nWhen the probability of attack is high, a packet-based detection scheme is the\nmost bandwidth efficient; however, when the probability of attack is low, the\noverhead involved with signing each packet becomes costly, and the\ngeneration-based scheme may be preferred.

To do it in a convenient way, we describe the trion as one electron\ninteracting with one exciton, and we use the tools we have developed in the new\ncomposite-exciton many-body theory. The trion-electron scattering contains a\ndirect channel in which ``in'' and ``out'' trions are made with the same\nfermions, and an exchange channel in which the ``in'' free electron becomes one\nof the ``out'' trion components. As expected, momenta are conserved in these\ntwo channels. The direct scattering is found to read as the bare Coulomb\npotential between elementary particles multiplied by a form factor which\ndepends on the ``in'' and ``out'' trion relative motion indices $\\eta$ and\n$\\eta'$, this factor reducing to $\\delta_{\\eta\\eta'}$ in the zero momentum\ntransfer limit: In this direct channel, the trion at large distance reacts as\nan elementary particle, its composite nature showing up for large momentum\ntransfer. On the contrary, the fact that the trion is not elementary does\naffect the exchange channel for all momentum transfers. We thus conclude that a\n3-component fermion behaves as an elementary fermion for direct processes in\nthe small momentum transfer limit only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2008 08:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We consider a family of divergence\nmeasures (JD_alpha for alpha>0), the Jensen divergences of order alpha, which\ngeneralize JD as JD_1=JD. Using a result of Schoenberg, we prove that JD_alpha\nis the square of a metric for alpha lies in the interval (0,2], and that the\nresulting metric space of probability distributions can be isometrically\nembedded in a real Hilbert space. Quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence (QJD) is a\nsymmetrized and smoothed version of quantum relative entropy and can be\nextended to a family of quantum Jensen divergences of order alpha (QJD_alpha).\nWe strengthen results by Lamberti et al. by proving that for qubits and pure\nstates, QJD_alpha^1/2 is a metric space which can be isometrically embedded in\na real Hilbert space when alpha lies in the interval (0,2]. In analogy with\nBurbea and Rao's generalization of JD, we also define general QJD by\nassociating a Jensen-type quantity to any weighted family of states.\nAppropriate interpretations of quantities introduced are discussed and bounds\nare derived in terms of the total variation and trace distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2008 10:08:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2008 16:21:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 22:23:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 14:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-14"}

Interestingly, according to the\nrelativistic version of Bohmian mechanics using the Dirac equation, a massive\nparticle's speed is less than or equal to the speed of light, but not\nnecessarily less. That is, there are situations in which the particle actually\nreaches the speed of light---a very non-classical behavior. That leads us to\nthe question of whether such situations can be arranged experimentally. We\nprove a theorem, Theorem 5, implying that for generic initial wave functions\nthe probability that the particle ever reaches the speed of light, even if at\nonly one point in time, is zero. We conclude that the answer to the question is\nno. Since a trajectory reaches the speed of light whenever the quantum\nprobability current psi-bar gamma^mu psi is a lightlike 4-vector, our analysis\nconcerns the current vector field of a generic wave function and may thus be of\ninterest also independently of Bohmian mechanics. The fact that the current is\nnever spacelike has been used to argue against the possibility of\nfaster-than-light tunnelling through a barrier, a somewhat similar question.\nTheorem 5, as well as a more general version provided by Theorem 6, are also\ninteresting in their own right. They concern a certain property of a function\npsi: R^4 --> C^4 that is crucial to the question of reaching the speed of\nlight, namely being transverse to a certain submanifold of C^4 along a given\ncompact subset of space-time. While it follows from the known transversality\ntheorem of differential topology that this property is generic among smooth\nfunctions psi: R^4 --> C^4, Theorem 5 asserts that it is also generic among\nsmooth solutions of the Dirac equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2008 12:41:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 17:11:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2010 14:19:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 19:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-10"}

Our models are based on the assumption that\nthe stellar atmosphere consists of clumped matter, where the individual clumps\nhave a much larger optical thickness than the matter between the clumps. This\n`porosity' of the stellar atmosphere reduces the coupling between radiation and\nmatter, since photons tend to escape through the more tenuous gas between the\nclumps. This allows a star that formally exceeds the Eddington limit to remain\nstable, yet produce a steady outflow from the region where the clumps become\noptically thin. We have made a parameter study of wind models for a variety of\ninput conditions in order to explore the properties of continuum-driven winds.\n  The results show that the numerical simulations reproduce quite closely the\nanalytical scalings. The mass loss rates produced in our models are much larger\nthan can be achieved by line driving. This makes continuum driving a good\nmechanism to explain the large mass loss and flow speeds of giant outbursts, as\nobserved in eta Carinae and other luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. Continuum\ndriving may also be important in population III stars, since line driving\nbecomes ineffective at low metalicities. We also explore the effect of photon\ntiring and the limits it places on the wind parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2008 14:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We first test our model against the observed\nnumber density of AGNs with different intrinsic luminosity as a function of\nredshift. The model yields a ''downsizing'' behavior in close agreement with\nthe observed one for z<2. At higher redshifts, the model predicts an overall\nabundance of AGNs (including Compton-thick sources) larger than the observed\nCompton-thin sources by a factor around 2 for z>2 and L_X < 10^{44} erg/s.\nThus, we expect that at such luminosities and redshifts about 1/2 of the total\nAGN population is contributed by Compton-thick sources.
