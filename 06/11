Here, we\npresent deep (300ks) X-ray imagery of NGC604 obtained as part of the Chandra\nACIS Survey of M33 (ChASeM33), which show highly structured X-ray emission\ncovering ~70% of the full Halpha extent of NGC604. The main bubbles and\ncavities in NGC604 are filled with hot (kT=0.5keV) X-ray emitting gas and X-ray\nspectra extracted from these regions indicate that the gas is thermal. For the\nwestern part of NGC604 we derive an X-ray gas mass of ~4300M_sol and an\nunabsorbed (0.35-2.5keV) X-ray luminosity of L_X = 9.3E35 erg/s. These values\nare onsistent with a stellar mass loss bubble entirely powered by about 200\nOB-stars. This result is remarkable because the standard bubble model tends to\nunderpredict the luminosity of X-ray bright bubbles and usually requires\nadditional heating from SNRs. Given a cluster age of ~3Myr it is likely that\nthe massive stars have not yet evolved into SNe. We detect two discrete spots\nof enhanced and harder X-ray emission, which we consider to be fingerprints\nfrom a reverse shock produced by a supersonic wind after it collided with the\nshell wall. In the eastern part of NGC604 the X-ray gas mass amounts to\n~1750M_sol. However, mass loss from young stars cannot account for the\nunabsorbed X-ray luminosity of L_X = 4.8E35 erg/s. Off-center SNRs could\nproduce the additional luminosity. The bubbles in the east seem to be much\nolder and were most likely formed and powered by stars and SNe in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2008 16:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A major focus is the study of (n,k)-uniform BBC\ngames - those in which all link costs, link lengths and preference weights are\nequal (to 1) and all budgets are equal (to k).

Gas within some\ncharacteristic radius (a function of the orbital parameters, mass ratio, and\ngas fraction of the merging galaxies), will quickly lose angular momentum to\nthe stars sharing the perturbed disk, fall to the center and be consumed in a\nstarburst. A similar analysis predicts where violent relaxation of the stellar\ndisks is efficient. Our model allows us to predict the stellar and gas content\nthat will survive to re-form a disk in the remnant, versus being violently\nrelaxed or contributing to a starburst.

The disk torque\ndistribution per unit disk mass as a function of radius provides an important\ndiagnostic for the nature of the disk-planet interactions. We first consider\ntorque distributions for nonmigrating planets of fixed mass and show that there\nis general agreement with the expectations of resonance theory. We then present\nresults of simulations for mass-gaining, migrating planets. For planets with an\ninitial mass of 5 Earth masses, which are embedded in disks with standard\nparameters and which undergo run-away gas accretion to one Jupiter mass (Mjup),\nthe torque distributions per unit disk mass are largely unaffected by migration\nand accretion for a given planet mass. The migration rates for these planets\nare in agreement with the predictions of the standard theory for planet\nmigration (Type I and Type II migration). The planet mass growth occurs through\ngas capture within the planet's Bondi radius at lower planet masses, the Hill\nradius at intermediate planet masses, and through reduced accretion at higher\nplanet masses due to gap formation. During run-away mass growth, a planet\nmigrates inwards by only about 20% in radius before achieving a mass of ~1\nMjup. For the above models, we find no evidence of fast migration driven by\ncoorbital torques, known as Type III migration. We do find evidence of Type III\nmigration for a fixed mass planet of Saturn's mass that is immersed in a cold\nand massive disk. In this case the planet migration is assumed to begin before\ngap formation completes. The migration is understood through a model in which\nthe torque is due to an asymmetry in density between trapped gas on the leading\nside of the planet and ambient gas on the trailing side of the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2008 00:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-18"}

Calculations also suggest an upper bound of x~0.03 for oxygen\nclusters to start off. The volume change induced by point uranium defects is\nmonotonic but nonlinear, whereas for oxygen defects, increase x always reduces\nthe system volume linearly, except dimers that require extra space for\naccommodation, which has been identified as meta-stable ionic molecule. Though\noxygen dimers usually occupy Willis O'' sites and mimic a single oxygen in\nenergetics and charge state, they are rare at ambient conditions.

Methods: The fluxes of the far-infrared [O i] and [O iii] lines are\nextracted from the previously unpublished archival ISO data. The archival\nSpitzer data are used to determine the fluxes of the O, Ne, Si, S, Ar and Fe\nion fine-structure lines originating in the FMKs.

The comparisons\nprovide further evidence for asymmetry of physical processes in\nEarthward/tailward reconnection outflow regions. Variance anisotropy and\nspectral anisotropy angles estimated from the multi-scale magnetic fluctuations\nin the tailward outflow region show features which are characteristic for\nmagnetohydrodynamic cascading turbulence in the presence of a local mean\nmagnetic field. The multi-scale magnetic fluctuations in the Earthward outflow\nregion are exhibiting more power, lack of variance and scale dependent\nanisotropies, but also having larger anisotropy angles. In this region the\nmagnetic field is more dipolar, the main processes driving turbulence are flow\nbreaking/mixing, perhaps combined with turbulence ageing and non-cascade\nrelated multi-scale energy sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2008 10:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-12"}

The rationale for doing this lies in the\nfact that, as it is well known, the non-Maxwellian contributions to the\ndistribution function of the granular mixture become more important in the\nrange of strong dissipation we are interested in. The form of the transport\ncoefficients is quite common in both standard and modified Sonine\napproximations, the distinction appearing in the explicit form of the different\ncollision frequencies associated with the transport coefficients. Additionally,\nwe numerically solve by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method the\ninelastic Boltzmann equation to get the diffusion and the shear viscosity\ncoefficients for two and three dimensions.

Though there have been a\nvariety of insights into the combinatorial aspects of transcriptional control,\nthe mechanism of DNA looping as an agent of combinatorial control in both\nprokaryotes and eukaryotes remains unclear. We use single-molecule techniques\nto dissect DNA looping in the lac operon. In particular, we measure the\npropensity for DNA looping by the Lac repressor as a function of the\nconcentration of repressor protein and as a function of the distance between\nrepressor binding sites. As with earlier single-molecule studies, we find (at\nleast) two distinct looped states and demonstrate that the presence of these\ntwo states depends both upon the concentration of repressor protein and the\ndistance between the two repressor binding sites. We find that loops form even\nat interoperator spacings considerably shorter than the DNA persistence length,\nwithout the intervention of any other proteins to prebend the DNA.

A DNS of two dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence with an\ninverse energy cascade and a k^{-5/3} power law is used to investigate\nproperties of pair separation in two dimensional turbulence. A special focus\nlies on the time asymmetry observed between forward and backward separation.\nApplication of the present model to this data suffers from finite inertial\nrange effects and thus, conditional averaging on scales rather than on time has\nbeen employed to obtain values for the Richardson constants and their ratio.\nThe Richardson constants for the forward and backward case are found to be\n(1.066 +/- 0.020) and (0.999 +/- 0.007) respectively. The ratio of Richardson\nconstants for the backwards and forwards case is therefore g_b/g_f = (0.92 +/-\n0.03), and hence exhibits a qualitatively different behavior from pair\nseparation in three dimensional turbulence, where g_b > g_f (J Berg et al.,\n2006, Phys.Rev.E, 74(1), p.016304).

What makes results\nso sensitive and the system so different from simple local magnetic moments\ninteracting via basic superexchange mechanisms is the itinerant character of\nthe calculated magnetic ground state, where very soft magnetic moments and\nlong-range interactions are characterized by a particular structure in the\nreciprocal (as opposed to real) space. Therefore, unravelling the magnetic\ninteractions in their full richness remains a challenging, but utterly\nimportant task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2008 15:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2008 19:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The 13CO and C18O J=2-1 line emission is\nobserved from the disk with 1.4'' resolution using the Submillimeter Array. We\nadopt the disk physical structure derived from a model which fits the spectral\nenergy distribution of HD169142. We obtain the full three-dimensional\ninformation on the CO emission with the aid of a molecular excitation and\nradiative transfer code. This information is used for the analysis of our\nobservations and previous 12CO J=2-1 and 1.3 mm continuum data. The disk is in\nKeplerian rotation and seen at an inclination close to 13 deg from face-on. We\nconclude that the regions traced by different CO isotopologues are distinct in\nterms of their vertical location within the disk, their temperature and their\ncolumn densities. With the given disk structure, we find that freeze-out is not\nefficient enough to remove a significant amount of CO from gas phase. Both\nobserved lines match the model prediction both in flux and in the spatial\nstructure of the emission. Therefore we use our data to derive the 13CO and\nC18O mass and consequently the 12CO mass using standard isotopic ratios. We\nconstrain the total disk gas mass to (0.6-3.0)x10(-2) Msun.

A\ntotal of 96 early-type stars are identified in the targeted region, which\namounts to nearly half of the observed sample. Most of them have featureless\nnear-infrared spectra as expected from OB stars at the available resolution.\nAnother 18 stars that display Brackett emission lines can be divided between\nevolved massive stars (most likely Be stars) and Herbig Ae/Be stars based on\ntheir infrared excesses. A component associated with Cygnus OB9/NGC 6910 is\nclearly identified, as well as an enhancement in the surface density of\nearly-type stars at Cygnus X North. We also find a field population, consisting\nlargely of early B giants and supergiants, which is probably the same as\nidentified in recent studies of the inner 1-degree circle around Cygnus OB2.\nThe age and large extension of this population discards a direct relationship\nwith Cygnus OB2 or any other particular association. Earlier claims of the\npossible large extent of Cygnus OB2 beyond its central, very massive aggregate\nseem to be dismissed by our findings. The existence of a nearly ubiquitous\npopulation of evolved stars with massive precursors suggests a massive star\nformation history in Cygnus having started long before the formation of the\ncurrently observed OB associations in the region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2008 14:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
