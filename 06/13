For angular momentum near the maximum, they\nhave larger area than rotating AdS black holes. Thin black rings also exist in\ndeSitter space, with rotation velocities varying between zero and a maximum,\nand with a radius that is always strictly below the Hubble radius. Our general\nanalysis allows us to include black Saturns as well, which we discuss briefly.\nWe present a simple physical argument why supersymmetric AdS black rings must\nnot be expected: they do not possess the necessary pressure to balance the AdS\npotential.

We propose a novel method based on a pre-optics setup that\nbehaves partly as a low-efficiency coronagraph, and partly as a\nhigh-sensitivity wavefront aberration compensator (phase and amplitude). The\ncombination of the two effects results in a highly accurate corrected\nwavefront. First, an (intensity-) unbalanced nulling interferometer (UNI)\nperforms a rejection of part of the wavefront electric field. Then the\nrecombined output wavefront has its input aberrations magnified. Because of the\nunbalanced recombination scheme, aberrations can be free of phase singular\npoints (zeros) and can therefore be compensated by a downstream phase and\namplitude correction (PAC) adaptive optics system, using two deformable\nmirrors. In the image plane, the central star's peak intensity and the noise\nlevel of its speckled halo are reduced by the UNI-PAC combination: the\noutput-corrected wavefront aberrations can be interpreted as an improved\ncompensation of the initial (eventually already corrected) incident wavefront\naberrations. The important conclusion is that not all the elements in the\noptical setup using UNI-PAC need to reach the lambda/10000 rms surface error\nquality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 19:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Also, concerning the transport properties of turbulence, we find\nthat rotation affects only the transport of particle and only for rapid\nrotation, leading to an almost isotropic transport (whereas, in the case of\nperpendicular rotation and shear, rotation favors isotropic transport even for\nslow rotation).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 18:55:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2008 12:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-08"}

An analysis of time-dependent spin transport at a\nsemiconductor/ferromagnet junction provides a direct evidence of memristive\nbehaviour. Our scheme is fundamentally different from previously discussed\nschemes of memristive devices and broadens the possible range of applications\nof semiconductor spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 21:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-21"}

Specifically we find for Source 1 the\nlocation of the turn on and turn off points of activity, RON= -1.63+-0.03 AU,\nROFF= +1.49+-0.20 AU, TON= -87+-5 d, TOFF= +94+-15 d, the time lag, LAG(q)=\n6+-1 d, the total active time, TACTIVITY= 181+-16 d, and the amplitude of the\nsecular light curve, ASEC(1,1) = 4.8+-0.1 mag. c) From this information the\nphotometric age and the time-age defined in Ferrin (Icarus 178, 493-516, 2005a,\nand Icarus, 185, 523-543, 2006), can be calculated, and we find P-AGE=97+-8\ncomet years and T-AGE= 103+-9 comet years (cy).

The magnetic field of zeta Ori A is the weakest magnetic field ever\ndetected on a massive star. The measured field is lower than the thermal\nequipartition limit (about 100 G). By fitting NLTE model atmospheres to our\nspectra, we determined that zeta Ori A is a 40 Msun star with a radius of 25\nRsun and an age of about 5 - 6 Myr, showing no surface nitrogen enhancement and\nlosing mass at a rate of about 2x10^(-6) Msol/yr. The magnetic topology of zeta\nOri A is apparently more complex than a dipole and involves two main magnetic\npolarities located on both sides of the same hemisphere; our data also suggest\nthat zeta Ori A rotates in about 7.0 d and is about 40 degrees away from\npole-on to an Earth-based observer. Despite its weakness, the detected magnetic\nfield significantly affects the wind structure; the corresponding Alfven radius\nis however very close to the surface, thus generating a different rotational\nmodulation in wind lines than that reported on the two other known magnetic O\nstars. The rapid rotation of zeta Ori A with respect to theta^1 Ori C appears\nas a surprise, both stars having similar unsigned magnetic fluxes (once\nrescaled to the same radius); it may suggest that the sub-equipartition field\ndetected on zeta Ori A is not a fossil remnant (as opposed to that of theta^1\nOri C and HD 191612), but the result of an exotic dynamo action produced\nthrough MHD instabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 21:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Through physical argument from four physical pictures in\ndifferent aspects, we provide strong evidences that the persistent spin current\ndoes exist in a device with SOI in the absence of any magnetic materials. This\npersistent spin current is an analog of the persistent charge current in a\nmesoscopic ring threaded by a magnetic flux, and it describes the real spin\nmotion and can be measured experimentally. We then investigate the definition\nof the spin current. We point out that (i) the non-zero spin current in the\nequilibrium SOI device is the persistent spin current, (ii) the spin current is\nin general not conserved, and (iii) the Onsager relation is violated for the\nspin transport no matter what definition of the spin current is used. These\nissues, the non-zero spin current in the equilibrium case, the non-conserved\nspin current, and the violation of the Onsager relation, are intrinsic\nproperties of spin transport.

In addition,\nthe relationship between the persistent spin current and transport spin\ncurrent, the persistent linear and angular spin currents in the SOI region of\nthe hybrid ring, are discussed.

It can predict numerical values of physical quantities to a\nspectacular degree of accuracy. However, from the very early days it has been\nknown that, in QED, there are two important problems which are linked with the\nvery foundation of the theory. In 1952, Dyson put forward strong argumnts to\nsuggest that the perturbation seires in quantum electrodynamics can not be\nconvergent. Just three years latter, in 1955, Landau argued that the effective\nrunning coupling constant in QED has a pole (Landau singularity) albeit at some\nvery high energy scale. This paper addresses, in details, the question of\nstability of perturbative vacuum state of QED in the light of these two well\nknown problems.\n  Landau has been a cult-like figure for many of us who studied theoretical\nphysics in the former Soviet Union. As an undergraduate student in the\ndepartment of theoretical physics of People's Friendship University, Moscow, in\n1970's, I grew up hearing colourful stories about the legendary persona of Lev\nDavidovich from my teachers some of whom had known him at personal level.

Numerical\nsimulations of the nonlinear field theory are difficult to perform in\n(3+1)-dimensions, due to the existence of multiple length and time scales. In\nthis paper we study a (2+1)-dimensional analogue of cosmic vortons, which we\nrefer to as kinky vortons, where the cosmic string is replaced by a kink\nstring. Many of the expected qualitative aspects of cosmic vortons transfer to\nkinky vortons, with the advantage that several approximations used in the study\nof cosmic vortons can be replaced by exact results. Furthermore, the numerical\nstudy of kinky vortons requires less computational resources than cosmic\nvortons, so a number of issues can be addressed in some depth. The radius of\nthe kinky vorton is determined as a function of the charge and winding number,\nand it is shown that the chiral limit is a repulsive fixed point. Stability to\nboth axial and non-axial perturbations is demonstrated in the electric and\nchiral regimes, though surprisingly long lived ringing modes are observed.\nKinky vortons which are too magnetic are shown to suffer from a pinching\ninstability, which results in a reduction in the winding number and can convert\nmagnetic into electric solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2008 09:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Cardiac tissue and the Belousov-Zhabotinsky\nreaction are examples of such media. In cardiac tissue, chaotic behaviour is\nbelieved to underlie fibrillation which, without intervention, precedes cardiac\ndeath. In this study we investigate suppression of the turbulence using\nstimulation of two different types, \"modulation of excitability\" and \"extra\ntransmembrane current\". With cardiac defibrillation in mind, we used a single\npulse as well as repetitive extra current with both constant and feedback\ncontrolled frequency. We show that turbulence can be terminated using either a\nresonant modulation of excitability or a resonant extra current. The turbulence\nis terminated with much higher probability using a resonant frequency\nperturbation than a non-resonant one. Suppression of the turbulence using a\nresonant frequency is up to fifty times faster than using a non-resonant\nfrequency, in both the modulation of excitability and the extra current modes.\nWe also demonstrate that resonant perturbation requires strength one order of\nmagnitude lower than that of a single pulse, which is currently used in\nclinical practice to terminate cardiac fibrillation. Our results provide a\nrobust method of controlling complex chaotic spatio-temporal processes.\nResonant drift of spiral waves has been studied extensively in two dimensions,\nhowever, these results show for the first time that it also works in three\ndimensions, despite the complex nature of the scroll wave turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2008 14:48:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2008 12:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Below a critical temperature (typically <30\nK), the gyroscopes measure a significant deviation from their usual offset due\nto Earth's rotation. This deviation is proportional to the applied angular ring\nvelocity with maximum signals towards lower temperatures. The anomalous\ngyroscope signal is about 8 orders of magnitude smaller then the applied\nangular ring velocity, compensating about one third of the Earth rotation\noffset at an angular top speed of 420 rad/s. Moreover, our data shows a parity\nviolation as the effect appears to be dominant for rotation against the Earth's\nspin. No systematic effect was found to explain this effect including the\nmagnetic environment, vibration and helium gas friction suggesting that our\nobservation is a new low temperature phenomenon. Tests in various\nconfigurations suggest that the rotating low temperature helium may be the\nsource of our anomalous signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2008 15:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2008 09:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-17"}
