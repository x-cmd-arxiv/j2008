In response to this emerging standard, the database\ncommunity is currently exploring efficient storage techniques for RDF data and\nevaluation strategies for SPARQL queries. A meaningful analysis and comparison\nof these approaches necessitates a comprehensive and universal benchmark\nplatform. To this end, we have developed SP^2Bench, a publicly available,\nlanguage-specific SPARQL performance benchmark. SP^2Bench is settled in the\nDBLP scenario and comprises both a data generator for creating arbitrarily\nlarge DBLP-like documents and a set of carefully designed benchmark queries.\nThe generated documents mirror key characteristics and social-world\ndistributions encountered in the original DBLP data set, while the queries\nimplement meaningful requests on top of this data, covering a variety of SPARQL\noperator constellations and RDF access patterns. As a proof of concept, we\napply SP^2Bench to existing engines and discuss their strengths and weaknesses\nthat follow immediately from the benchmark results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 15:31:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2008 14:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-21"}

The 2\nsmallest representations of SU(2/1) adequately describe the electron, neutrino,\nup and down quarks and correlate their chiralities with their U(1) charges, and\nthe Higgs fields have the quantum numbers of the odd generators. But so far,\nthere was an apparent conflict with unitarity, because the quark representation\nis not Hermitian and the super-Killing metric is not positive definite. We\nsolve this paradox by assuming the existence of 2 complex Higgs doublets\nminimally coupled to the Fermions via the chiral projections of the odd\ngenerators of SU(2/1). We find that Lagrangian induced by the Fermion loops is\nunitary, thanks to the balance between the leptons and the quarks needed to\ncancel the triangle anomaly and that the super-Jacobi identity guarantees that\nthe photon remains massless after symmetry breaking. In addition, the\nLagrangian has a classical geometric interpretation in terms of the curvature\nof the corresponding Hermitian algebra. Assuming that the relative strength of\nthe scalar and vector couplings does not depend on the number of families\nconstrains the mass of the Higgs to $M^2_{H^0_1} + M^2_{H^0_2} = 32/9 M^2_W = 2\n(107.2 GeV)^2$. Contrary to grand-unified or Wess-Zumino super-symmetric\nmodels, the SU(2/1) internal super-unification does not predict any unobserved\nparticle besides the 2 Higgs doublets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2008 18:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-01"}

However, CTTS surveys reveal that accretion hot spots cover a\nsmall fraction of the stellar surface, and that the net field polarization on\nthe stellar surface is small. Both facts imply that the magnetic field\ngenerated by the star has a complex non-dipolar structure. To address this\ndiscrepancy between theory and observations, we re-examine X-wind theory\nwithout the dipole constraint. Using simple physical arguments based on the\nconcept of trapped flux, we show that a dipole configuration is in fact not\nessential. Independent of the precise geometry of the stellar magnetosphere,\nthe requirement for a certain level of trapped flux predicts a definite\nrelationship among various CTTS observables. Moreover, superposition of\nmultipole stellar fields naturally yield small observed hot-spot covering\nfractions and small net surface polarizations. The generalized X-wind picture\nremains viable under these conditions, with the outflow from a small annulus\nnear the inner disk edge little affected by the modified geometry, but with\ninflow highly dependent on the details of how the emergent stellar flux is\nlinked and trapped by the inner disk regions.

In Phase II, which\ncontinues until drop $H_2\\simeq68$m, or $T_2\\simeq3.8$s, the acceleration is\n$a\\simeq5$m/s$^2$, while in Phase III which continues for the remaining of the\ndata set, $a \\simeq -1$m/s$^2$. We propose that the collapse of WTC 7 is\ninitiated by a total and sudden annihilation of the base (section of the\nbuilding from the ground level to $H_1$), which then allows the top section\n(building above $H_1$) to free fall during Phase I, and then collide with the\nground in Phase II and III. The total duration of the collapse, assuming that\nPhase III continues to the end, is in the range $7.8-8.6$s. We derive a\nphysical model for collision of the building with the ground, in which we\ncorrect the \"crush-up\" model of Ba\\v{z}ant and Verdure, J. Engr. Mech. ASCE,\n{\\bf 133} (2006) 308, and estimate the magnitude of the resistive force in the\ntop section. We compare our findings to those of NIST investigators and find an\nagreement with respect to the distribution of damage in the primary zone. We\nconclude that the building was destroyed in a highly controlled fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2008 22:41:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2008 19:36:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2008 00:05:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2009 05:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-20"}

Multi-frequency VLBA\nobservations of 5 HFPs were carried out in both the optically thick and thin\npart of the spectrum to determine the spectral shape and angular size of the\ncomponents for which individual radio spectra were obtained. We find that the\nmagnetic fields measured using observations agree well with those obtained by\nassuming equipartition, which implies that these sources are in minimum energy\ncondition and the turnover in their spectra is due probably to SSA.

It is found that a proper treatment of\nFermi motion is essential for the two processes. While the average momentum\napproximation can partly simulate the Fermi motion in the process, the ``frozen\nnucleon'' assumption yields very different results, especially at lower\nenergies. The Coulomb effect induced by the interaction between the positively\ncharged kaon and the hypertriton is found to be negligible. The influence of\nhigher partial waves is also found to be relatively small, in contrast to the\nfinding of the previous work. The off-shell assumption is found to be very\nsensitive in the case of electroproduction rather than in photoproduction. It\nis shown that the few available experimental data favor the assumption that the\ninitial nucleon is off-shell and the final hyperon is on-shell. This seems to\nbe reasonable, since the hyperon in the hypertriton is less bound than the\nnucleon in the initial 3He nucleus. The effect of the missing resonance\nD_{13}(1895) is more profound in the longitudinal cross sections.

Several significant qualitative changes are found.

This concerns in particular the\nsearch of possible exact kinetic equations and, specifically, the conjecture\nproposed by Grad (Grad, 1972) and developed in a seminal work by Lanford\n(Lanford, 1974) that kinetic equations - such as the Boltzmann equation for a\ngas of classical hard spheres - might result exact in an appropriate asymptotic\nlimit, usually denoted as Boltzmann-Grad limit. The Lanford conjecture has\nactually had a profound influence on the scientific community, giving rise to a\nwhole line of original research in kinetic theory and mathematical physics.\nNevertheless, several aspects of the theory remain to be addressed and\nclarified. In fact, its validity has been proven for the Boltzmann equation\nonly at most in a weak sense, i.e., if the Boltzmann-Grad limit is defined\naccording to the weak * convergence. While it is doubtful whether the result\napplies for arbitrary times and for general situations (and in particular more\ngenerally for classical systems of particles interacting via binary forces), it\nremains completely unsolved the issue whether the conjecture might be valid\nalso in a stronger sense (\\textit{strong Lanford conjecture}). This paper will\npoint out a physical model providing a counter-example to the strong Lanford\nconjecture, representing a straightforward generalization of the classical\nmodel based on a gas of hard-smooth spheres.

Cooperation refers to the process of nodes\nworking together to relay data toward the destination.

We illustrate this trade-off by studying\ninformation-theoretic decode-forward based coding strategies for data\ntransmission in multi-terminal networks. Decode-forward strategies are usually\ndiscussed in the context of omniscient coding, in which all nodes in the\nnetwork fully cooperate with each other, both in encoding and decoding. In this\npaper, we investigate myopic coding, in which each node cooperates with only a\nfew neighboring nodes. We show that achievable rates of myopic decode-forward\ncan be as large as that of omniscient decode-forward in the low SNR regime. We\nalso show that when each node has only a few cooperating neighbors, adding one\nnode into the cooperation increases the transmission rate significantly.\nFurthermore, we show that myopic decode-forward can achieve non-zero rates as\nthe network size grows without bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 12:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

The\n\\Lambda(1405), as an I=0 quasi-bound state of Kbar and a nucleon, appears to\nsurvive in the ppK^- cluster. Estimates are given for the influence of p-wave\nKbarN interactions and for the width from two-nucleon absorption (KbarNN -> YN)\nprocesses. With inclusionof these effects and dispersive corrections from\nabsorption, the ppK^- binding energy is expected to be in the range 20 - 40\nMeV, while the total decay width can reach 100 MeV but with large theoretical\nuncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 15:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 08:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-18"}
