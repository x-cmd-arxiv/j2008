Here we study the\nrole of social networks in promoting content on Digg, a social news aggregator\nthat allows users to submit links to and vote on news stories. Digg's goal is\nto feature the most interesting stories on its front page, and it aggregates\nopinions of its many users to identify them. Like other social networking\nsites, Digg allows users to designate other users as ``friends'' and see what\nstories they found interesting. We studied the spread of interest in news\nstories submitted to Digg in June 2006. Our results suggest that pattern of the\nspread of interest in a story on the network is indicative of how popular the\nstory will become. Stories that spread mainly outside of the submitter's\nneighborhood go on to be very popular, while stories that spread mainly through\nsubmitter's social neighborhood prove not to be very popular. This effect is\nvisible already in the early stages of voting, and one can make a prediction\nabout the potential audience of a story simply by analyzing where the initial\nvotes come from.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2008 17:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

The receiver $R_i$ is interested in $x_i$, and has\nprior \\emph{side information} comprising some subset of the $n$ bits. This\ncorresponds to a directed graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, where $i j$ is an edge iff\n$R_i$ knows the bit $x_j$. An \\emph{index code} for $G$ is an encoding scheme\nwhich enables each $R_i$ to always reconstruct $x_i$, given his side\ninformation. The minimal word length of an index code was studied by\nBar-Yossef, Birk, Jayram and Kol (FOCS 2006). They introduced a graph\nparameter, $\\minrk_2(G)$, which completely characterizes the length of an\noptimal \\emph{linear} index code for $G$. The authors of BBJK showed that in\nvarious cases linear codes attain the optimal word length, and conjectured that\nlinear index coding is in fact \\emph{always} optimal.\n  In this work, we disprove the main conjecture of BBJK in the following strong\nsense: for any $\\epsilon > 0$ and sufficiently large $n$, there is an\n$n$-vertex graph $G$ so that every linear index code for $G$ requires codewords\nof length at least $n^{1-\\epsilon}$, and yet a non-linear index code for $G$\nhas a word length of $n^\\epsilon$. This is achieved by an explicit\nconstruction, which extends Alon's variant of the celebrated Ramsey\nconstruction of Frankl and Wilson.\n  In addition, we study optimal index codes in various, less restricted,\nnatural models, and prove several related properties of the graph parameter\n$\\minrk(G)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2008 17:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-12"}

The radio lobes in these\nsystems have created visible cavities in the surrounding hot, X-ray-emitting\ngas, which allow direct measurement of the mechanical jet power of radio\nsources over six decades of radio luminosity, independently of the radio\nproperties themselves. Using these measurements, we examine the ratio between\nradio power and total jet power (the radiative efficiency). We find that jet\n(cavity) power increases with radio synchrotron power approximately as P_jet ~\n(L_radio)^beta, where 0.35 < beta < 0.70 depending on the bandpass of\nmeasurement and state of the source. However, the scatter about these relations\ncaused by variations in radiative efficiency spans more than four orders of\nmagnitude. After accounting for variations in synchrotron break frequency\n(age), the scatter is reduced by ~ 50%, yielding the most accurate scaling\nrelation available between the lobe bolometric radio power and the jet (cavity)\npower. We place limits on the magnetic field strengths and particle content of\nthe radio lobes using a variety of X-ray constraints. We find that the lobe\nmagnetic field strengths vary between a few to several tens of microgauss\ndepending on the age and dynamical state of the lobes. If the cavities are\nmaintained in pressure balance with their surroundings and are supported by\ninternal fields and particles in equipartition, the ratio of energy in\nelectrons to heavy particles (k) must vary widely from approximately unity to\n4000, consistent with heavy (hadronic) jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2008 18:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-26"}

Cold cataract is\na phase separation effect that proceeds via spinodal decomposition of the lens\ncytoplasm with cooling. Intensity auto-correlation functions of the lens\nprotein content are analyzed with the aid of two methods providing information\non the populations and dynamics of the scattering elements associated with cold\ncataract. It is found that the temperature dependence of many measurable\nparameters changes appreciably at the characteristic temperature ~16+1 oC which\nis associated with the onset of cold cataract. Extending the temperature range\nof this work to previously inaccessible regimes, i.e. well below the phase\nseparation or coexistence curve at Tcc, we have been able to accurately\ndetermine the temperature dependence of the collective and self-diffusion\ncoefficient of proteins near the spinodal. The analysis showed that the\ndynamics of proteins bears some resemblance to the dynamics of structural\nglasses where the apparent activation energy for particle diffusion increases\nbelow Tcc indicating a highly cooperative motion.

The location of the shock is also dictated by the cooling efficiency\nin that higher the accretion rate (${\\dot m}$), the closer is the shock\nlocation.

The quiescent data show a photometric wave with\na cycle about 303(15)d. We analyzed the profile of the composite (or mean)\noutburst. We discovered however, that a variety of different outburst heights\nand durations had occurred, contrary to theoretical predictions. With\nincreasing maximum brightness, we find that the decay time also increases; this\nis in contrast to the model predictions, which indicate that outbursts should\nhave a constant shape. This is interpreted as representing the presence of\noutburst-to-outburst variability of the magnetospheric radius. A presence of a\nnumber of missed weak narrow outbursts is predicted from this statistical\nrelationship. A new type of variability is detected, during 3 subsequent nights\nin 2007: periodic (during one nightly run) oscillations with rapidly-decreasing\nfrequency from 86 to 47 cycles/day and a semi-amplitude increasing from 0.06 to\n0. 10, during a monotonic brightness increase from 14. 27 to 14. 13.

Jupiter\nand Saturn, for example, have several bands of alternating eastward (prograde)\nand westward (retrograde) jets relative to the angular velocity of their global\nmagnetic fields. These surface wind profiles are likely manifestations of the\nvariations in depth and latitude of angular velocity deep within the liquid\ninteriors of these planets. Two decades ago it was proposed that this\ndifferential rotation could be maintained by vortex stretching of convective\nfluid columns that span the interiors of these planets from the northern\nhemisphere surface to the southern hemisphere surface. This now classic\nmechanism explains the differential rotation seen in laboratory experiments and\nin computer simulations of, at best, weakly turbulent convection in rotating\nconstant-density fluid spheres. However, these experiments and simulations are\npoor approximations for the density-stratified strongly-turbulent interiors of\ngiant planets. The long thin global convective columns predicted by the classic\ngeostrophic theory for these planets would likely not develop. Here we propose\na much more robust mechanism for maintaining differential rotation in radius\nbased on the local generation of vorticity as rising plumes expand and sinking\nplumes contract. Our high-resolution two-dimensional computer simulations\ndemonstrate how this mechanism could maintain either prograde or retrograde\nsurface winds in the equatorial region of a giant planet depending on how the\ndensity scale height varies with depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 06:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this article we study the spectral theory of the\ncombinatorial Laplacian for sequences of discrete tori when the orders of the\ncyclic factors tend to infinity at comparable rates. First we show that the\nsequence of heat kernels corresponding to the degenerating family converges,\nafter re-scaling, to the heat kernel on an associated real torus. We then\nestablish an asymptotic expansion, in the degeneration parameter, of the\ndeterminant of the combinatorial Laplacian. The zeta-regularized determinant of\nthe Laplacian of the limiting real torus appears as the constant term in this\nexpansion. On the other hand, using a classical theorem by Kirchhoff the\ndeterminant of the combinatorial Laplacian of a finite graph divided by the\nnumber of vertices equals the number of spanning trees, called the complexity,\nof the graph. As a result, we establish a precise connection between the\ncomplexity of the Cayley graphs of finite abelian groups and heights of real\ntori. It is also known that spectral determinants on discrete tori can be\nexpressed using trigonometric functions and that spectral determinants on real\ntori can be expressed using modular forms on general linear groups. Another\ninterpretation of our analysis is thus to establish a link between limiting\nvalues of certain products of trigonometric functions and modular forms. The\nheat kernel analysis which we employ uses a careful study of I-Bessel\nfunctions. Our methods extend to prove the asymptotic behavior of other\nspectral invariants through degeneration, such as special values of spectral\nzeta functions and Epstein-Hurwitz type zeta functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 07:28:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 13:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-02"}

Thus far it has been proved difficult to reconcile such\ncorrelations with the empirically observed constituent quark number scaling\n(CQNS) at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). To address this problem\nwe combine our earlier developed quark recombination model with quark\nphase-space distributions computed from relativistic Langevin simulations in an\nexpanding Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Hadronization is based on resonance\nformation within a Boltzmann equation which recovers thermal equilibrium and\nobeys energy conservation in the quark-coalescence process, while the fireball\nbackground is adjusted to hydrodynamic simulations of semi-central Au-Au\ncollisions at RHIC. To facilitate the applicability of the Langevin process, we\nfocus on strange and charm quarks. Their interactions in the QGP are modeled\nusing leading-order perturbative QCD augmented by effective Lagrangians with\nresonances which smoothly merge into hadronic states formed at T_c. The\ninteraction strength is adjusted to reproduce the empirical saturation value\nfor the quark-elliptic flow, v_{2,q}^{sat}~7-8%. The resulting phi and J/\\psi\nelliptic flow recover CQNS over a large range in transverse momentum (p_T)\nwithin a few percent. As a function of transverse kinetic energy, both the\nquark spectra from the Langevin simulations and the meson spectra generated via\nresonance recombination recover CQNS from zero to at least 3 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 12:15:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 20:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-12"}

This is done in the light of the generalized sampling theory by\nusing the oversampling technique: more samples than strictly necessary are\nused. For a suitable choice of the sampling period, a necessary and sufficient\ncondition is given in terms of the Kronecker canonical form of a matrix pencil.\nComparing with other characterizations in the mathematical literature, the\ngiven here has an important advantage: it can be reliable computed by using the\nGUPTRI form of the matrix pencil.

In general, the underlying\nalgebra $A$ need not have an identity and the coproduct $\\Delta$ does not map\n$A$ into $A\\otimes A$ but rather into its multiplier algebra $M(A\\otimes A)$.\nIn this paper, we study {\\it some tools} that are frequently used when dealing\nwith such multiplier Hopf algebras and that are typical for working with\nalgebras without identity in this context.\n  The {\\it basic ingredient} is a unital left $A$-module $X$. And the basic\nconstruction is that of extending the module by looking at linear maps\n$\\rho:A\\to X$ satisfying $\\rho(aa')=a\\rho(a')$ where $a,a'\\in A$. We write the\nmodule action as multiplication. Of course, when $x\\in X$, and when\n$\\rho(a)=ax$, we get such a linear map. And if $A$ has an identity, all linear\nmaps $\\rho$ have this form for $x=\\rho(1)$. However, the point is that in the\ncase of a non-unital algebra, the space of such maps is in general strictly\nbigger than $X$ itself. We get an {\\it extended module}, denoted by $\\bar X$\n(for reasons that will be explained in the paper).\n  We study all sorts of more complicated situations where such extended modules\noccur and we illustrate all of this with {\\it several examples}, from very\nsimple ones to more complex ones where iterated extensions come into play. We\nrefer to cases that appear in the literature.\n  We use this basic idea of extending modules to explain, in a more rigorous\nway, the so-called {\\it covering technique}, which is needed when using {\\it\nSweedler notations} for coproducts and coactions.

The $^{13}$C species are\ndetected in two compact ($\\sim 2.3''$), hot (170 K) cores with a column density\nof $\\sim 3.8 \\times 10^{16}$ and $1.1 \\times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively.\nIn the main source, the so-called ``Large Molecule Heimat'', we derive an\nabundance of $2.9 \\times 10^{-9}$ for each $^{13}$C species relative to H$_2$.\nAn isotopic ratio $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C of 21 has been measured. Based on a\ncomparison to the column densities measured for the $^{13}$C species of ethyl\ncyanide also detected in this survey, it is suggested that the two hot cores of\nSgr B2(N) are in different evolutionary stages. Supplementary laboratory data\nfor the main isotopic species recorded between 92 and 342 GHz permitted an\nimprovement of its spectroscopic parameters as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 15:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

A\nq-query locally decodable quantum code encodes n classical bits in an m-qubit\nstate, in such a way that each of the encoded bits can be recovered with high\nprobability by a measurement on at most q qubits of the quantum code, even if a\nconstant fraction of its qubits have been corrupted adversarially. We show that\nsuch a quantum code can be transformed into a classical q-query locally\ndecodable code of the same length that can be decoded well on average (albeit\nwith smaller success probability and noise-tolerance). This shows, roughly\nspeaking, that q-query quantum codes are not significantly better than q-query\nclassical codes, at least for constant or small q.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 15:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-13"}
