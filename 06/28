The equality of all six CC bond lengths, despite the\nalternating double and single bonds, and the surplus (resonance) energy, led to\nthe suggestion of two resonanting structures.

We vary only\nthe jet's input power between P_{jet} = 10^{41}-10^{47} {\\rm erg/sec}.

During the active phase, when the jet is fed by the AGN,\nthe cloud is subject both to compression and stripping, which tend to increase\nits density and diminish its total mass. When the jet is switched off (i.e.\nduring the passive phase) the shocked cloud cools further and tends to become\nmore filamentary, under the action of a back-flow which develops within the\ncocoon.

HD40307 is a K2V metal-deficient star at a\ndistance of only 13 parsec, part of the HARPS GTO high-precision planet-search\nprogramme. The three planets on circular orbits have very low minimum masses of\nrespectively 4.2, 6.9 and 9.2 Earth masses and periods of 4.3, 9.6 and 20.5\ndays. The planet with the shortest period is the lightest planet detected\nto-date orbiting a main sequence star. The detection of the correspondingly low\namplitudes of the induced radial-velocity variations is completely secured by\nthe 135 very high-quality HARPS observations illustrated by the radial-velocity\nresiduals around the 3-Keplerian solution of only 0.85 m/s. Activity and\nbisector indicators exclude any significant perturbations of stellar intrinsic\norigin, which supports the planetary interpretation. Contrary to most\nplanet-host stars, HD40307 has a marked sub-solar metallicity ([Fe/H]=-0.31),\nfurther supporting the already raised possibility that the occurrence of very\nlight planets might show a different dependence on host star's metallicity\ncompared to the population of gas giant planets. In addition to the 3 planets\nclose to the central star, a small drift of the radial-velocity residuals\nreveals the presence of another companion in the system the nature of which is\nstill unknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2008 18:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Hence we conclude that, while the formation epoch of early-type\nonly depends on their mass, the environment does regulate the timescales of\ntheir star formation histories. Our deep $U$-band imaging strongly supports\nthis conclusions. It shows that cluster galaxies are at least 0.5 mag fainter\nthan their field contemporaries of similar mass and optical-to-infrared colors,\nimplying that the last episode of star formation must have happened more\nrecently in the field than in the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2008 19:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}

We find that the vast majority of non-power-law\nIRAC color-selected AGN candidates in GOODS-S have colors consistent with those\nof star-forming galaxies.

Finally, we show that the fraction of MIR sources dominated by\nan AGN decreases with decreasing MIR flux density, but only down to f_24 = 300\nuJy.

Our theory shows that the scattering mechanism is dominated\nby virtual transitions to negatively ionized donor levels.

To use of classical\ncontrol approach to formally solve a MIMO problem, one needs to come up with\nmultidimensional Root Locus diagram to tune the control parameters.

An atomic hydrogen hops around till it finds\nanother one with which it combines. This necessarily implies that the average\nrecombination time, or equivalently, the effective grain surface area depends\non the relative numbers of atomic hydrogen influx rate and the number of sites\non the grain. Our aim is to discover this dependency. We perform a numerical\nsimulation to study the recombination of hydrogen on grain surfaces in a\nvariety of cloud conditions. We use a square lattice (with a periodic boundary\ncondition) of various sizes on two types of grains, namely, amorphous carbon\nand olivine. We find that the steady state results of our simulation match very\nwell with those obtained from a simpler analytical consideration provided the\n`effective' grain surface area is written as $\\sim S^{\\alpha}$, where, $S$ is\nthe actual physical grain area and $\\alpha$ is a function of the flux of atomic\nhydrogen which is determined from our simulation. We carry out the simulation\nfor various astrophysically relevant accretion rates. For high accretion rates,\nsmall grains tend to become partly saturated with $H$ and $H_2$ and the\nsubsequent accretion will be partly inhibited. For very low accretion rates,\nthe number of sites to be swept before a molecular hydrogen can form is too\nlarge compared to the actual number of sites on the grain, implying that\n$\\alpha$ is greater than unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2008 09:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We\nalso find the time dependence, particularly when a grain is freshly injected\ninto the system. Apart from the fact that the recombination times seem to be\nfunctions of the grain parameters such as the activation barrier energy,\ntemperature etc, our result also shows the dependence on the number of sites in\nthe grain $S$ and the effective accretion rate per site $a_s$ of atomic\nhydrogen. Simply put, the average time that a pair of atomic hydrogens will\ntake to produce one molecular hydrogen depends on how heavily the grain is\nalready populated by atomic and molecular hydrogens and how fast the hopping\nand desorption times are. We show that if we write the average recombination\ntime as $T_r \\sim S^\\alpha/A_H$, where, $A_H$ is the hopping rate, then\n$\\alpha$ could be much greater than 1 for all astrophysically relevant\naccretion rates.

It was shown that in the case of the kinetic dynamics\ndetermined only by the WZNW term, half odd integer spin systems show a lack of\ntunneling phenomena whereas integer spin systems are subject to it \\cite{l} in\nthe case of potentials with easy-plane easy-axis symmetry. Here we prove, for\nthe theory with a normal quadratic kinetic term of arbitrary strength or the\nfirst order theory with azimuthal symmetry (which is equivalently the so-called\neasy-axis situation), that the tunneling is in fact suppressed for all non-zero\nvalues of spin. This model exemplifies the concept that in the presence of\ncomplex Euclidean action, it is necessary to use the ensuing complex critical\npoints in order to define the quantum (perturbation) theory \\cite{ampr}. In the\npresent example, if we do not do so, exactly the opposite, erroneous\nconclusion, that the tunneling is unsuppressed for all spins, is reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2008 15:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Compared to the widely adopted assumption of saturated network, the\nproposed criterion can be applied to general networks whereby the contending\nstations are characterized by specific packet arrival rates, $\\lambda_s$, and\ntransmission rates $R_d^{s}$.\n  The throughput allocation resulting from the proposed algorithm is able to\ngreatly increase the aggregate throughput of the DCF while ensuring fairness\nlevels among the stations of the same order of the ones available with the\nclassical PF criterion. Put simply, each station is allocated a throughput that\ndepends on a suitable normalization of its packet rate, which, to some extent,\nmeasures the frequency by which the station tries to gain access to the\nchannel. Simulation results are presented for some sample scenarios, confirming\nthe effectiveness of the proposed criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2008 15:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}
