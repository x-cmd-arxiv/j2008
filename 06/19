A new stochastic\nclassical approach to the quantum fluctuations of spacetime is developed. The\nwork extends conceptually Boyer's random electrodynamics to a theory of random\ngravity but has a considerably richer structure for inheriting nonlinearity\nfrom general relativity. Attention is drawn to subtleties in choosing boundary\nconditions for metric fluctuations in relation to their dynamical consequences.\nThose compatible with the observed Lorentz invariance must allow for\nspontaneous conformal fluctuations, in addition to stochastic gravitational\nwaves due to zero point gravitons. This is implemented through an effective\nmetric defined in terms of the random spacetime metric modulo a fluctuating\nconformal factor. It satisfies an effective Einstein equation coupled to an\neffective stress-energy tensor incorporating gravitational self energy of\nmetric fluctuations as well as matter fields. The effective Einstein equation\nis expanded up to second order nonlinearity. A UV-cutoff is introduced whose\nspecific value, however, does not enter into the resulting description of\nrandom gravity. The averaged effective metric satisfies the empty space\nEinstein equation with an effective cosmological constant. This vanishes when\nonly the massless matter fields are included. More generally, a finite\neffective cosmological constant compatible with the observational constraints\ncan be obtained as long as the bare masses of the massive matter fields are\nnearly zero, or the conformal invariance of matter is restored at some high\nenergy scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 16:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-19"}

There exists an overlap in the domains of validity of each\ndescription, and the black-hole and post-Newtonian metrics are matched in the\noverlap. The matching procedure produces the equations of motion for the black\nhole and the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic tidal fields acting on the\nblack hole.

For both protein models, the transition state ensemble is\nrather heterogeneous and splits-up into structurally different populations. For\nthe more complex geometry the identified subpopulations are actually\nstructurally disjoint. For the less complex native geometry we found a broad\ntransition state with microscopic heterogeneity. For both geometries, the\nidentification of the folding nucleus via the Pfold analysis agrees with the\nidentification of the folding nucleus carried out with the phi-value analysis.\nFor the most complex geometry, however, the apllied methodologies give more\nconsistent results than for the more local geometry. The study of the\ntransition state' structure reveals that the nucleus residues are not\nnecessarily fully native in the transition state. Indeed, it is only for the\nmore complex geometry that two of the five critical residues show a\nconsiderably high probability of having all its native bonds formed in the\ntransition state. Therefore, one concludes that in general the phi-value\ncorrelates with the acceleration/deceleration of folding induced by mutation,\nrather than with the degree of nativeness of the transition state, and that the\ntraditional interpretation of phi-values may provide a more realistic picture\nof the structure of the transition state only for more complex native\ngeometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 18:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-06"}

We have discovered\nin the Orion Nebula a pair of stellar twins in a newborn binary star system.\nEach star in the binary has a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses, identical to\nwithin 2 percent.

The difference between these approaches has evolved\ninto a systematic effect that does not go away as higher orders in the\nperturbative expansion are added. We attempt to clarify under which\ncircumstances one or the other approach provides a better approximation to the\ntrue result. To this end, we propose to describe the Adler function series by a\nmodel that includes the exactly known coefficients and theoretical constraints\non the large-order behaviour originating from the operator product expansion\nand the renormalisation group.

The entropy change\ndS is proportional to the change in horizon area while dQ and T are the energy\nflux across the horizon and Unruh temperature seen by an accelerating observer\njust inside the horizon. The internal entropy production term dS_i is\nproportional to the squared shear of the horizon and the ratio of the\nproportionality constant to the area entropy density is \\hbar/4\\pi. Here we\nwill show that this derivation can be reformulated in the language of\nhydrodynamics. We postulate that the vacuum thermal state in the Rindler wedge\nof spacetime obeys the holographic principle. Hydrodynamic perturbations of\nthis state exist and are manifested in the dynamics of a stretched horizon\nfluid at the horizon boundary.

This result implies that \\hbar/4\\pi is the shear\nviscosity to entropy density ratio of the local vacuum thermal state. The value\n\\hbar/4\\pi has attracted much attention as the shear viscosity to entropy\ndensity ratio for all gauge theories with an Einstein gravity dual.

The goal of this paper is to examine the effects of four realistic\ninstrument systematics in the 30 GHz frequency maps: non-axially-symmetric\nbeams, sample integration, sorption cooler noise, and pointing errors. We\nsimulated one year long observations of four 30 GHz detectors. The simulated\ntimestreams contained CMB, foreground components (both galactic and\nextra-galactic), instrument noise (correlated and white), and the four\ninstrument systematic effects. We made maps from the timelines and examined the\nmagnitudes of the systematics effects in the maps and their angular power\nspectra. We also compared the maps of different mapmaking codes to see how they\nperformed. We used five mapmaking codes (two destripers and three optimal\ncodes). None of our mapmaking codes makes an attempt to deconvolve the beam\nfrom its output map. Therefore all our maps had similar smoothing due to beams\nand sample integration. Temperature to polarization cross-coupling due to beam\nmismatch causes a detectable bias in the TE spectrum of the CMB map. The\neffects of cooler noise and pointing errors did not appear to be major concerns\nfor the 30 GHz channel.

Given an\ninitially smooth scalar distribution, the decay rate $d<\\theta^2>/dt$ of the\nscalar variance $<\\theta^2>$ is found to be bounded in terms of controlled\nphysical parameters. Furthermore, in the zero diffusivity limit, $\\kappa\\to0$,\nthis rate vanishes as $\\kappa^{\\alpha_0}$ if there exists an $\\alpha_0\\in(0,1]$\nindependent of $\\kappa$ such that $<|(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2}\\theta|^2><\\infty$ for\n$\\alpha\\le\\alpha_0$. This condition is satisfied if in the limit $\\kappa\\to0$,\nthe variance spectrum $\\Theta(k)$ remains steeper than $k^{-1}$ for large wave\nnumbers $k$. When no such positive $\\alpha_0$ exists, the scalar field may be\nsaid to become virtually singular. A plausible scenario consistent with\nBatchelor's theory is that $\\Theta(k)$ becomes increasingly shallower for\nsmaller $\\kappa$, approaching the Batchelor scaling $k^{-1}$ in the limit\n$\\kappa\\to0$. For this classical case, the decay rate also vanishes, albeit\nmore slowly -- like $(\\ln P_r)^{-1}$, where $P_r$ is the Prandtl or Schmidt\nnumber. Hence, diffusion anomaly is ruled out for a broad range of scalar\ndistribution, including power-law spectra no shallower than $k^{-1}$. The\nimplication is that in order to have a $\\kappa$-independent and non-vanishing\ndecay rate, the variance at small scales must necessarily be greater than that\nallowed by the Batchelor spectrum. These results are discussed in the light of\nexisting literature on the asymptotic exponential decay $<\\theta^2>\\sim\ne^{-\\gamma t}$, where $\\gamma>0$ is independent of $\\kappa$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2008 11:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We show that the $dcx$ order is preserved\nunder some of the natural operations considered on random measures and point\nprocesses, such as deterministic displacement of points, independent\nsuperposition and thinning as well as independent, identically distributed\nmarking. Further operations such as position dependent marking and displacement\nof points though do not preserve the $dcx$ order on all point processes, are\nshown to preserve the order on Cox point processes.

In our high-resolution\noptical spectra from 2000, however, we could not identify any HeI line. The\nobserved changes in spectral behaviour of S23 lead to different spectral\nclassifications at different observing epochs. The aim of this research is,\ntherefore, to find and discuss possible scenarios that might cause a\ndisappearance of the photospheric HeI absorption lines within a period of only\n11 years. From our high-resolution optical spectra, we perform a detailed\ninvestigation of the different spectral appearances of S23. We further\ndetermine the projected rotational velocities of S23 in the two epochs of\nobservations. Based on its spectral appearance in 2000, we classify S23 as A1Ib\nstar with an effective temperature of about 9000 K. Further, an interstellar\nextinction value of E(B-V) = 0.03 is derived. This is considerably lower than\nthe previously published value, which means that, if the circumstellar\nextinction due to the stellar wind is neglected, the interstellar extinction,\nand hence the luminosity of the star, are overestimated. We derive a rotation\nvelocity of v sin i = 150km/s, which means that S23 is rotating with about 75%\nof its critical speed. The object S23 is thus the fourth B[e] supergiant with\nconfirmed high projected rotational velocity. The most striking result is the\napparent cooling of S23 by more than 1500 K with a simultaneous increase of its\nrotation speed by about 35% within only 11 years.

They find that the arrival directions\nare not isotropic, but instead appear correlated with the positions of nearby\nAGNs. Our aim was to determine the sources of these UHECRs by comparing their\narrival directions with more comprehensive source catalogs.\n  Four (eight) of the 27 UHECRs with energy >56EeV detected by the Pierre Auger\nObservatory have arrival directions within 1.5deg (3.5deg) of the extended\n(>180kpc) radio structures of nearby radiogalaxies or the single nearby BLLac\nwith extended radio structure. Conversely the radio structures of three (six)\nof all ten nearest extended radiogalaxies are within 1.5deg (3.5deg) of a\nUHECR; three of the remaining four radiogalaxies are in directions with lower\nexposure times. This correlation between nearby extended radiogalaxies and a\nsubset of UHECRs is significant at the 99.9% level. This is the first direct\nobservational proof that radio galaxies are a significant source of UHECRs. For\nthe remaining ~20 UHECRs, an isotropic distribution cannot be ruled out at high\nsignificance. The correlation found by the Auger Collaboration between the 27\nUHECRs and AGNs in the Veron-Cetty & Veron catalog at D < 71Mpc has a much\nlower significance when one considers only the ~20 UHECRs not `matched' to\nnearby extended radiogalaxies. No correlation is seen between UHECRs and\nsupernovae, supernova remnants, nearby galaxies, or nearby groups and clusters\nof galaxies. The primary difference between the UHECR detections at the Pierre\nAuger Observatory and previous experiments may thus be that the Southern\nHemisphere is more privileged with respect to nearby extended radiogalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2008 15:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-18"}
