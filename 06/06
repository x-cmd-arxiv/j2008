With this method, light quark or gluon jets\nwith pT ~ 1 TeV can be rejected with an efficiency of around 99% while\nretaining up to 40% of top jets. This reduces the dijet background to heavy\nt-tbar resonances by a factor of ~10,000, thereby allowing resonance searches\nin t-tbar to be extended into the all-hadronic channel. In addition,\ntop-tagging can be used in t-tbar events when one of the tops decays\nsemi-leptonically, in events with missing energy, and in studies of b-tagging\nefficiency at high pT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2008 19:57:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2008 17:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Here I extend this analysis\nto higher temperatures approaching the point where the heterogeneities\ndisappear and thermal activation barriers become small.

The importance of our approach is to model\nthe Brownian motion more realistically than the usual one based on the\nclassical Langevin equation, in that it takes into account also the retarding\neffects due to hydrodynamic backflow, i.e. the added mass and the Basset memory\ndrag. On the basis of the two fluctuation-dissipation theorems and of the\ntechniques of the Fractional Calculus we have provided the analytical\nexpressions of the correlation functions (both for the random force and the\nparticle velocity) and of the mean squared particle displacement. The random\nforce has been shown to be represented by a superposition of the usual white\nnoise with a \"fractional\" noise. The velocity correlation function is no longer\nexpressed by a simple exponential but exhibits a slower decay, proportional to\n$t^{-3/2}$ as $t \\to \\infty$, which indeed is more realistic. Finally, the mean\nsquared displacement has been shown to maintain, for sufficiently long times,\nthe linear behaviour which is typical of normal diffusion, with the same\ndiffusion coefficient of the classical case. However, the Basset history force\ninduces a retarding effect in the establishing of the linear behaviour, which\nin some cases could appear as a manifestation of anomalous diffusion to be\ncorrectly interpreted in experimental measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2008 16:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-06"}

Our model relies on an existing angle-averaged prescription to\ncompute the absorption of starlight by dust in stellar birth clouds and in the\nambient ISM in galaxies. We compute the spectral energy distribution of the\npower reradiated by dust in stellar birth clouds as the sum of three\ncomponents: a component of PAHs; a mid-IR continuum characterising the emission\nfrom hot grains; and a component of warm grains in thermal equilibrium with\nadjustable temperature. In the ambient ISM, we fix for simplicity the relative\nproportions of these three components to reproduce the spectral shape of\ndiffuse cirrus emission in the Milky Way, and we include a component of cold\ngrains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature. Our model can be\nused to derive statistical constraints on the star formation histories and dust\ncontents of large samples of galaxies using UV, optical and IR observations. We\nillustrate this by deriving median-likelihood estimates of the star formation\nrates, stellar masses, effective dust optical depths, dust masses, and relative\nstrengths of different dust components of 66 well-studied nearby star- forming\ngalaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS). From this\nanalysis, we conclude that the mid- and far-IR colours of galaxies correlate\nstrongly with the specific star formation rate, as well as with other\ngalaxy-wide quantities connected to this parameter. Our model can be\nstraightforwardly applied to interpret UV, optical and IR spectral energy\ndistributions from any galaxy sample.

On large scales, the 21 cm and galaxy\nfields are anti-correlated during most of the reionization epoch. However, on\nscales smaller than the size of the H II regions around detectable galaxies,\nthe two fields become roughly uncorrelated. Consequently, the 21 cm-galaxy\ncross power spectrum provides a tracer of bubble growth during reionization,\nwith the signal turning over on progressively larger scales as reionization\nproceeds. The precise turnover scale depends on the minimum host mass of the\ndetectable galaxies, and the galaxy selection technique. Measuring the turnover\nscale as a function of galaxy luminosity constrains the characteristic bubble\nsize around galaxies of different luminosities. The cross spectrum becomes\npositive on small scales if ionizing photons fail to escape from low mass\ngalaxies, and these galaxies are detectable longward of the hydrogen ionization\nedge, because in this case some identifiable galaxies lie outside of ionized\nregions. LOFAR can potentially measure the 21 cm-galaxy cross spectrum in\nconjunction with mild extensions to the existing Subaru survey for $z=6.6$\nLyman-alpha emitters, while the MWA is slightly less sensitive for detecting\nthe cross spectrum. A futuristic galaxy survey covering a sizable fraction of\nthe MWA field of view ($\\sim 800$ deg$^2$) can probe the scale dependence of\nthe cross spectrum, constraining the filling factor of H II regions at\ndifferent redshifts during reionization, and providing other valuable\nconstraints on reionization models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2008 20:37:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Our results show that rotation enhances\nthe neutrino luminosities and the average energies of emitted neutrinos. This\nis because the thermalized inner core, which is the dominant neutrino source\nfrom Pop III stars, can be enlarged, due to rotational flattening, enough to\nextend the inner core outside the neutrinospheres. This is in sharp contrast to\nthe case of spherical collapse, in which the case of inner core shrinks deeper\ninside the neutrinospheres before black hole formation, which hinders the\nefficient neutrino emission. In the case of rotational core-collapse, the\nemitted neutrino energies are found to become larger in the vicinity near the\npole than the ones near the equatorial plane. These factors make the emergent\nneutrino spectrum broader and harder than the spherical collapse case. By\ncomputing the overall neutrino signals produced by the ensemble of individual\nrotating Pop III stars, we find that the amplitudes of the relic neutrinos,\ndepending on their star formation rates, can dominate over the contributions\nfrom ordinary core-collapse supernovae below a few MeV. A detection of this\nsignal could be an important tool to probe star formation history in the early\nuniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2008 00:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

This expansion is non-unique when 1 < beta <\n2, and the beta-encoder exploits this redundancy to correct inevitable errors\nmade by the quantizer component of its circuit design.\n  The multiplier element of the beta-encoder will also be imprecise;\neffectively, the true value beta at any time can only be specified to within an\ninterval [ beta_{low}, beta_{high} ]. This problem was addressed by the golden\nratio encoder, a close relative of the beta-encoder that does not require a\nprecise multiplier. However, the golden ratio encoder is susceptible to\nintegrator leak in the delay elements of its hardware design, and this has the\nsame effect of changing beta to an unknown value.\n  In this paper, we present a method whereby exponentially precise\napproximations to the value of beta in both golden ratio encoders and beta\nencoders can be recovered amidst imprecise circuit components from the\ntruncated beta-expansions of a \"test\" number x_{test} in [-1,1], and its\nnegative counterpart, -x_{test}.

The setup consists of a highly sensitive\nmagnetometer inside a superconducting shielding. This is then placed inside a\nstrong (but sub-critical) magnetic field. In ordinary electrodynamics the\nmagnetic field cannot permeate the superconductor and no field should register\non the magnetometer. However, photon -- hidden-sector photon -- photon\noscillations would allow to penetrate the superconductor and the magnetic field\nwould \"leak\" into the shielded volume and register on the magnetometer.\nAlthough this setup resembles a classic ``light shining though a wall\nexperiment'' there are two crucial differences. First, the fields are (nearly)\nstatic and the photons involved are virtual. Second, the magnetometer directly\nmeasures the field-strength and not a probability.

In this regime, the coherent-state-based\nprotocols start resembling single-photon-based repeater schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2008 13:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-14"}

We studied the properties of these \\emph{techni-O-helium} $tOHe$\n\"atoms\", which behave as warmer dark matter rather than cold. In this paper we\nextend our work on several different aspects. We study the possibility of a\nmixed scenario where both $tOHe$ and bound states between +2 and -2\nelectrically charged techniparticles coexist in the dark matter density. We\nargue that these newly proposed bound states solely made of techniparticles,\nalthough they behave as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), due to\ntheir large elastic cross section with nuclei, can only account for a small\npercentage of the dark matter density. Therefore we conclude that within the\nminimal WTC, composite dark matter should be mostly composed of $tOHe$.\nMoreover in this paper, we put cosmological bounds in the masses of the\ntechniparticles, if they compose the dark matter density. Finally we propose\nwithin this setup, a possible explanation of the discrepancy between the\nDAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA findings and the negative results of CDMS and other\ndirect dark matter searches that imply nuclear recoil measurement, which should\naccompany ionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2008 15:37:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2008 15:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this\ntheory the zeroth-order Hamiltonian describes the vibrational motion in a\nsingle random valley harmonically extended to infinity. This Hamiltonian is\ntractable, is evaluated a priori for monatomic liquids, and the same\nHamiltonian (the same set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) is used for\nequilibrium and nonequlibrium theory. Here, for the self intermediate\nscattering function Fself(q,t) we find the vibrational contribution is in near\nperfect agreement with molecular dynamics (MD) through short and intermediate\ntimes, at all q. This is direct confirmation that normal mode vibrational\ncorrelations are present in the motion of the liquid state. The primary transit\neffect is diffusive motion of the vibrational equilibrium positions, as the\nliquid transits rapidly among random valleys. This motion is modeled as a\nstandard random walk, and the resulting theoretical Fself(q,t) is in excellent\nagreement with MD results at all q and t. In the limit for q to infinity, the\ntheory automatically exhibits the correct approach to the free-particle limit.\nAlso in the limit for q to zero, the hydrodynamic limit emerges as well. In\ncontrast to the benchmark theories of generalized hydrodynamics and mode\ncoupling, the present theory is near a priori, while achieving modestly better\naccuracy. Therefore, in our view, it constitutes an improvement over the\ntraditional theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2008 15:42:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2008 21:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Moreover, self-collapse of such wormholes can only be\nprevented by the use of \"exotic matter,\" which, being rather problematical,\nshould be used in only minimal quantities. However, making the layer of exotic\nmatter arbitrarily thin leads to other problems, such as the need for extreme\nfine-tuning. This paper discusses a class of wormhole geometries that strike a\nbalance between reducing the proper distance across the exotic region and the\ndegree of fine-tuning required to achieve this reduction. Surprisingly, the\ndegree of fine-tuning appears to be a generic feature of the type of wormhole\ndiscussed. No particular restriction is placed on the throat size, even though\nthe proper thickness of the exotic region can indeed be quite small. Various\ntraversability criteria are shown to be met.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2008 15:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

IRAS 18151-1208 is a nearby massive region (d =\n3kpc, L ~ 20000 Lsun) which splits into three cores: MM1, MM2 and MM3\n(separated by 1'-2'). We aim at (1) studying the physical and chemical\nproperties of the individual MM1, MM2 and MM3 cores; (2) deriving their\nevolutionary stages; (3) using these results to improve our view of the\nevolutionary sequence of massive cores. The region was observed in the CS,\nC34S, H2CO, HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ lines at mm wavelengths with the IRAM 30m\nand Mopra telescopes. We use 1D and 2D modeling of the dust continuum to derive\nthe density and temperature distributions, which are then used in the RATRAN\ncode to model the lines and constrain the abundances of the observed species.\nAll the lines were detected in MM1 and MM2. MM3 shows weaker emission, or even\nis undetected in HCO+ and all isotopic species. MM2 is driving a newly\ndiscovered CO outflow and hosts a mid-IR-quiet massive protostar. The abundance\nof CS is significantly larger in MM1 than in MM2, but smaller than in a\nreference massive protostar such as AFGL2591. In contrast the N2H+ abundance\ndecreases from MM2 to MM1, and is larger than in AFGL2591. Both MM1 and MM2\nhost an early phase massive protostar, but MM2 (and mid-IR-quiet sources in\ngeneral) is younger and more dominated by the host protostar than MM1\n(mid-IR-bright). The MM3 core is probably in a pre-stellar phase. We find that\nthe N2H+/C34S ratio varies systematically with age in the massive protostars\nfor which the data are available. It can be used to identify young massive\nprotostars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2008 15:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
