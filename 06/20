In this work, we\nexplore the importance of negative UV radiative feedback on Tvir > 10^4 K halos\nduring the middle and late stages of reionization. We do not try to\nself-consistently model reionization; instead, we explore a large parameter\nspace in an attempt to draw general, robust conclusions. We do this using a\ntiered approach. Using 1-D hydrodynamical simulations, we model the collapse of\ngas onto halos of various masses under UVBs of various intensities. We then\ngenerate realistic, parametrized maps of the inhomogeneous UVB, using\nlarge-scale semi-numeric simulations. By combining these results, we find that\nunder all reasonably conservative scenarios, UV feedback on atomically-cooled\nhalos is not strong enough to notably delay the bulk of reionization. Such a\ndelay is only likely if ionizing efficiencies of z > 10 sources are much higher\n(~ two orders of magnitude) than z ~ 6 data seem to imply. We also find that\nfeedback is very strongly dependent on halo mass. Our results suggest that the\nnatural time-scale for the bulk of reionization is the growth of the global\ncollapsed fraction contained in Tvir > 10^4 K halos. Finally, our results\nunderscore the importance of taking into account extended dynamical ranges when\nmodeling reionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2008 17:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The junctions' conductance at room temperature and\ncurrent-voltage (I-V) characteristics at 4.2 K have been measured after the\nconsecutive stressing of the tunnel barrier at room temperature. Electrical\nstress was applied using current ramps with increasing amplitude ranging from 0\nto ~1000 Ic corresponding to voltages across the barrier up to 0.65 V where Ic\nis the Josephson critical current. A very soft breakdown has been observed with\npolarity-dependent breakdown current (voltage). A dramatic increase in subgap\nconductance of the junctions, the appearance of subharmonic current steps, and\ngradual increase in both the critical and the excess currents as well as a\ndecrease in the normal-state resistance have been observed. The observed\nchanges in superconducting tunneling suggest a model in which a progressively\nincreasing number of defects and associated additional conduction channels\n(superconducting quantum point contacts (SQPCs)) are induced by electric field\nin the tunnel barrier. By comparing the I-V characteristics of these conduction\nchannels with the nonstationary theory of current transport in SQPCs based on\nmultiple Andreev reflections by Averin and Bardas, the typical transparency D\nof the induced SQPCs was estimated as D ~ 0.7. The number of induced SQPCs was\nfound to grow with voltage across the barrier as sinh(V/V_0) with V_0 = 0.045\nV, in good agreement with the proposed model of defect formation by ion\nelectromigration.

However, previous derivations of these equations have\nmade a number of ad hoc assumptions and/or contain a number of unsatisfactory\nfeatures. For example, all previous derivations have invoked, without proper\njustification, the step of \"Lorenz gauge relaxation\", wherein the linearized\nEinstein equation is written down in the form appropriate to the Lorenz gauge,\nbut the Lorenz gauge condition is then not imposed--thereby making the\nresulting equations for the metric perturbation inequivalent to the linearized\nEinstein equations. In this paper, we analyze the issue of \"particle motion\" in\ngeneral relativity in a systematic and rigorous way by considering a\none-parameter family of metrics, $g_{ab} (\\lambda)$, corresponding to having a\nbody (or black hole) that is \"scaled down\" to zero size and mass in an\nappropriate manner. We prove that the limiting worldline of such a\none-parameter family must be a geodesic of the background metric, $g_{ab}\n(\\lambda=0)$. Gravitational self-force--as well as the force due to coupling of\nthe spin of the body to curvature--then arises as a first-order perturbative\ncorrection in $\\lambda$ to this worldline. No assumptions are made in our\nanalysis apart from the smoothness and limit properties of the one-parameter\nfamily of metrics. Our approach should provide a framework for systematically\ncalculating higher order corrections to gravitational self-force, including\nhigher multipole effects, although we do not attempt to go beyond first order\ncalculations here.

This deviation from\nbrownian motion is usually characterized by a sublinear time dependence of the\nmean square displacement (MSD). However, subdiffusive behavior can stem from\ndifferent microscopic scenarios, which can not be identified solely by the MSD\ndata. In this paper we present a theoretical framework which permits to\ncalculate analytically first-passage observables (mean first-passage times,\nsplitting probabilities and occupation times distributions) in disordered media\nin any dimensions. This analysis is applied to two representative microscopic\nmodels of subdiffusion: continuous-time random walks with heavy tailed waiting\ntimes, and diffusion on fractals. Our results show that first-passage\nobservables provide tools to unambiguously discriminate between the two\npossible microscopic scenarios of subdiffusion. Moreover we suggest experiments\nbased on first-passage observables which could help in determining the origin\nof subdiffusion in complex media such as living cells, and discuss the\nimplications of anomalous transport to reaction kinetics in cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2008 06:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this paper, we develop methods for low-rate\nsampling of continuous-time sparse signals in shift-invariant (SI) spaces,\ngenerated by m kernels with period T. We model sparsity by treating the case in\nwhich only k out of the m generators are active, however, we do not know which\nk are chosen. We show how to sample such signals at a rate much lower than m/T,\nwhich is the minimal sampling rate without exploiting sparsity. Our approach\ncombines ideas from analog sampling in a subspace with a recently developed\nblock diagram that converts an infinite set of sparse equations to a finite\ncounterpart. Using these two components we formulate our problem within the\nframework of finite compressed sensing (CS) and then rely on algorithms\ndeveloped in that context. The distinguishing feature of our results is that in\ncontrast to standard CS, which treats finite-length vectors, we consider\nsampling of analog signals for which no underlying finite-dimensional model\nexists.

The study of high redshift Tully-Fisher relations (TFRs) is limited\nby the use of long slit spectrographs, rest frame B band and star formation\nselected galaxies. Aims.

In this paper, we demonstrate our methods on our best case. This\ngalaxy, F257, at z=2.03, was selecte from a sample of candidate high redshift\nlarge disk galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field South that were selected with\nphotometric and morphological criteria. Methods. We used SINFONI at the VLT to\nobtain an integral field spectrum of the Halpha line and hence a velocity field\nand rotation curve. We also use UBVIJHK+IRAC band photometry to determine a\nstellar photometric mass. Results. We find that F257 is indistinguishable from\nlocal late type galaxies in many respects: it has a regular velocity field,\nincreasing velocity disperion towards its center, its rotation curve flattens\nat 1-2 disk scale lengths, it has the same specific angular momentum as local\ndisks, its properties are consistent with the local K band TFR. Although mainly\nrotationally supported, its gas component is dynamically heated with respect to\nlocal galaxies (V/sigma_z ~ 4) and it is offset from the local stellar mass TFR\nat the 2sigma level.

F257 is then a nearly (~75%) maximum\ndisk. The dynamical properties of F257 are more like those of local galaxies\nthan those of any other galaxy at similar redshift observed to date.

Also, in the\ncentral part of the double nuclei shell galaxy ESO 2400100 there is no\nsignificant polarization. We use the ionized gas velocity field of RR 24 to\ninterpret its linear polarization structure. In RR 24a the quite regular gas\nkinematics reflect the unperturbed spiral-like polarization structure. In RR\n24b a strong velocity gradient in ionized gas could be associated with the\npolarization structure. We suggest that the large-scale magnetic field of the\nRR 24 pair members still plays a role in shaping the polarization pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2008 13:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Phys. 110 (1999) 9785.] we\nunambiguously assign the fast initial decay signal to rotational dephasing of\nthe initial alignment created by the pump transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2008 14:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Here we review their 2003 analysis in light of additional experimental\nresults and theoretical understanding, which enable us to confirm, update and\nextend the conclusions of the LHC Safety Study Group. The LHC reproduces in the\nlaboratory, under controlled conditions, collisions at centre-of-mass energies\nless than those reached in the atmosphere by some of the cosmic rays that have\nbeen bombarding the Earth for billions of years. We recall the rates for the\ncollisions of cosmic rays with the Earth, Sun, neutron stars, white dwarfs and\nother astronomical bodies at energies higher than the LHC. The stability of\nastronomical bodies indicates that such collisions cannot be dangerous.\nSpecifically, we study the possible production at the LHC of hypothetical\nobjects such as vacuum bubbles, magnetic monopoles, microscopic black holes and\nstrangelets, and find no associated risks. Any microscopic black holes produced\nat the LHC are expected to decay by Hawking radiation before they reach the\ndetector walls. If some microscopic black holes were stable, those produced by\ncosmic rays would be stopped inside the Earth or other astronomical bodies. The\nstability of astronomical bodies constrains strongly the possible rate of\naccretion by any such microscopic black holes, so that they present no\nconceivable danger. In the case of strangelets, the good agreement of\nmeasurements of particle production at RHIC with simple thermodynamic models\nconstrains severely the production of strangelets in heavy-ion collisions at\nthe LHC, which also present no danger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2008 15:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2008 14:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Formulated as\nscalar-tensor theories, the f(R) theories imply the existence of a strong\ncoupling of the scalar field to matter. This would violate all experimental\ngravitational tests on deviations from Newton's law. Fortunately, the existence\nof a matter dependent mass and a thin shell effect allows one to alleviate\nthese constraints. The thin shell condition also implies strong restrictions on\nthe cosmological dynamics of the f(R) theories. As a consequence, we find that\nthe equation of state of dark energy is constrained to be extremely close to -1\nin the recent past. We also examine the potential effects of f(R) theories in\nthe context of the Eot-wash experiments. We show that the requirement of a thin\nshell for the test bodies is not enough to guarantee a null result on\ndeviations from Newton's law. As long as dark energy accounts for a sizeable\nfraction of the total energy density of the Universe, the constraints which we\ndeduce also forbid any measurable deviation of the dark energy equation of\nstate from -1.
