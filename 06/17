Such functions express how a non-linearly evolved Fourier\nmode depends on the full ensemble of modes in the initial density field. We\nidentify and resum the dominant diagrams in the large-$k$ limit, showing\nexplicitly that multi-point propagators decay into the nonlinear regime at the\nsame rate as the two-point propagator. These analytic results generalize the\nlarge-$k$ limit behavior of the two-point propagator to arbitrary order. We\nmeasure the three-point propagator as a function of triangle shape in numerical\nsimulations and confirm the results of our high-$k$ resummation. We show that\nany $n-$point spectrum can be reconstructed from multi-point propagators, which\nleads to a physical connection between nonlinear corrections to the power\nspectrum at small scales and higher-order correlations at large scales. As a\nfirst application of these results, we calculate the reduced bispectrum at\none-loop in renormalized perturbation theory and show that we can predict the\ndecrease in its dependence on triangle shape at redshift zero, when standard\nperturbation theory is least successful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 16:46:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2008 14:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-23"}

Even when the hydrodynamic processes, on\ntheir own, generate negligible levels of transport, they may still affect the\nevolution of the disk via their influence on the MRI. Here, we study the\ninteraction between the MRI and hydrodynamic turbulence using local MRI\nsimulations that include hydrodynamic forcing. As expected, we find that\nhydrodynamic forcing is generally negligible if it yields a saturated kinetic\nenergy density that is small compared to the value generated by the MRI. For\nstronger hydrodynamic forcing levels, we find that hydrodynamic turbulence\nmodifies transport, with the effect varying depending upon the spatial scale of\nhydrodynamic driving. Large scale forcing boosts transport by an amount that is\napproximately linear in the forcing strength, and leaves the character of the\nMRI (for example the ratio between Maxwell and Reynolds stresses) unchanged, up\nto the point at which the forced turbulence is an order of magnitude stronger\nthan that generated by the MRI. Low amplitude small scale forcing may modestly\nsuppress the MRI. We conclude that the impact of hydrodynamic turbulence on the\nMRI is generically ignorable in cases, such as convection, where the additional\nturbulence arises due to the accretion energy liberated by the MRI itself.\nHydrodynamic turbulence may affect (and either enhance or suppress) the MRI if\nit is both strong, and driven by independent mechanisms such as self-gravity,\nsupernovae, or solid-gas interactions in multiphase protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 20:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Providing an E-value calibration protocol, we\ndemonstrated earlier the feasibility of translating either the score or\nheuristic E-value reported by any method into the textbook-defined E-value,\nwhich may serve as the universal statistical standard. This protocol, although\nrobust, may lose spectrum-specific statistics and might require a new\ncalibration when changes in experimental setup occur. To mitigate these issues,\nwe developed a new MS/MS search tool, RAId_aPS, that is able to provide\nspectrum-specific E-values for additive scoring functions. Given a selection of\nscoring functions out of RAId score, K-score, Hyperscore and XCorr, RAId_aPS\ngenerates the corresponding score histograms of all possible peptides using\ndynamic programming. Using these score histograms to assign E-values enables a\ncalibration-free protocol for accurate significance assignment for each scoring\nfunction. RAId_aPS features four different modes: (i) compute the total number\nof possible peptides for a given molecular mass range, (ii) generate the score\nhistogram given a MS/MS spectrum and a scoring function, (iii) reassign\nE-values for a list of candidate peptides given a MS/MS spectrum and the\nscoring functions chosen, and (iv) perform database searches using selected\nscoring functions.

However, the recent results of the long-term\nmulti-epoch observations of quasars, active galaxies, tracing the structure\nfurther along the jets and following the motion of individual features for\nlonger time, rise questions that are difficult to understand by the standard\nballistic model. I.e., the ejecta are aligned with the local jet direction,\ninstead of the core; and within individual jets apparently inward-moving\nfeatures are observed. Here we show that these unexpected phenomena, although\nonly a small fraction among large samples, indicate the existence of\nnon-ballistic jet motion, in which a continuous jet produces a discrete hot\nspot. And the precession of such a hot spot in the plane of the sky appears\nsuperluminal. Therefore, an unified and simple interpretation to the new\nresults is obtained, which can be further tested through its predictions on the\nevolution of ejecta. The study is of importance in the understanding of the\nnature of superluminal motion, the interaction of jets and surrounding\nmaterials, as well as the common physics underlying quasars and microquasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 06:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Quantum turbulence (QT) was discovered in superfluid $^4$He in the\n1950s, and the research has tended toward a new direction since the mid 90s.\nThe similarities and differences between quantum and classical turbulence have\nbecome an important area of research. QT is comprised of quantized vortices\nthat are definite topological defects, being expected to yield a model of\nturbulence that is much simpler than the classical model. The general\nintroduction of the issue and a brief review on classical turbulence are\nfollowed by a description of the dynamics of quantized vortices. Then, we\ndiscuss the energy spectrum of QT at very low temperatures. At low wavenumbers,\nthe energy is transferred through the Richardson cascade of quantized vortices,\nand the spectrum obeys the Kolmogorov law, which is the most important\nstatistical law in turbulence; this classical region shows the similarity to\nconventional turbulence. At higher wavenumbers, the energy is transferred by\nthe Kelvin-wave cascade on each vortex. This quantum regime depends strongly on\nthe nature of each quantized vortex. The possible dissipation mechanism is\ndiscussed. Finally, important new experimental studies, which include\ninvestigations into temperature-dependent transition to QT, dissipation at very\nlow temperatures, QT created by vibrating structures, and visualization of QT,\nare reviewed. The present article concludes with a brief look at QT in atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 09:40:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2008 02:01:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

As people made the claim they have ignored the\nselection biases which must be important since GRB observations are strongly\nfluence or flux-limited. In this paper we show that, when the selection effects\nare considered, the intrinsic distribution of the GRB energy can be very broad.\nThe number of faint GRBs has been significantly underestimated because of the\nfluence or flux limit. The bright part of the distribution has been affected by\nanother important selection effect arising from the beaming of GRB jets, which\nis instrument-independent and caused by the fact that brighter GRBs tend to\nhave smaller jet angles and hence smaller probabilities to be detected. Our\nfinding indicates that GRBs are not a standard energy reservoir, and challenges\nthe proposal that GRBs can be used as standard candles to probe cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 12:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-16"}

These Si-based nanostructures\nrepresent the p-type high mobility silicon quantum well (Si-QW) confined by the\ndelta - barriers heavily doped with boron. The ESR studies show that the delta\n- barriers appear to consist of the trigonal dipole centers, B(+)-B(-), which\nare caused by the negative-U reconstruction of the shallow boron acceptors,\n2B(0)=>B(+)-B(-). The temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the\nresistance, thermo-emf, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility demonstrate\nthat the high temperature superconductivity observed seems to result from the\ntransfer of the small hole bipolarons through these negative-U dipole centers\nof boron at the Si-QW - delta - barrier interfaces. The value of the\nsuperconductor energy gap obtained is in a good agreement with the data derived\nfrom the oscillations of the conductance in normal state and of the\nzero-resistance supercurrent in superconductor state as a function of the bias\nvoltage. These oscillations appear to be correlated by on- and off-resonance\ntuning the two-dimensional subbands of holes with the Fermi energy in the\nsuperconductor delta - barriers. Finally, the proximity effect in the S- Si-QW\n-S structure is revealed by the findings of the multiple Andreev reflection\n(MAR) processes and the quantization of the supercurrent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 14:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The focus of our survey was to monitor the\nso-called WNL stars for radial-velocity (RV) variability in order to identify\nthe short- to intermediate-period ($P \\la 200$ days) binaries among them. Our\nresults are in line with results of previous studies of other WR subtypes, and\nshow that the binary frequency among LMC WNL stars is statistically consistent\nwith that of WNL stars in the Milky Way. We have identified four previously\nunknown binaries, bringing the total number of known WNL binaries in the LMC to\nnine. Since it is very likely that none but one of the binaries are classical,\nhelium-burning WNL stars, but rather superluminous, hence extremely massive,\nhydrogen-burning objects, our study has dramatically increased the number of\nknown binaries harbouring such objects, and thus paved the way to determine\ntheir masses through model-independent, Keplerian orbits. It is expected that\nsome of the stars in our binaries will be among the most massive known. With\nthe binary status of each WR star now known, we also studied the photometric\nand X-ray properties of our program stars using archival MACHO photometry as\nwell as Chandra and ROSAT data. We find that one of our presumably single WNL\nstars is among the X-ray brightest WR sources known. We also identify a binary\ncandidate from its RV variability and X-ray luminosity which harbours the most\nluminous WR star known in the Local Group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 14:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Through deep, I, z', J, H, K\nphotometry of a 20' x 20' field in OMC 2/3, we selected brown dwarf candidates\nfor follow-up spectroscopy. Low resolution far-red and near-infrared spectra\nwere obtained for the candidates, and 19 young brown dwarfs in the OMC 2/3\nregion are confirmed. They exhibit spectral types of M6.5-M9, corresponding to\napproximate masses of 0.075-0.015 M_solar using the evolutionary models of\nBaraffe et al. (1998). At least one of these bona fide young brown dwarfs has\nstrong Halpha emission, indicating that it is actively accreting. In addition,\nwe confirm 21 new low mass members with spectral types of M4-M6, corresponding\nto approximate masses of 0.35-0.10 M_solar in OMC 2/3. By comparing pre-main\nsequence tracks to the positions of the members in the H-R diagram, we find\nthat most of the brown dwarfs are less than 1 Myr, but find a number of low\nmass stars with inferred ages greater than 3 Myr. The discrepancy in the\nstellar and substellar ages is due to our selection of only low luminosity\nsources; however, the presence of such objects implies the presence of an age\nspread in the OMC 2/3 region. We discuss possible reasons for this apparent age\nspread.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 15:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

They can thus describe the matter ingredients only truly\nmicroscopically and it is not possible to avoid strong quantum regimes by\npositing a large matter content. Moreover, possible parity violating effects\nare important especially in loop quantum cosmology whose basic object is a\ndifference equation for the wave function of the universe defined on a discrete\nspace of triads. The two orientations of a triad are interchanged by a parity\ntransformation, which leaves the difference equation invariant for ordinary\nmatter. Here, we revisit and extend loop quantum cosmology by introducing\nfermions and the gravitational torsion they imply, which renders the parity\nissue non-trivial. A treatable locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi model is\nintroduced which clearly shows the role of parity. General wave functions\ncannot be parity-even or odd, and parity violating effects in matter influence\nthe microscopic big bang transition which replaces the classical singularity in\nloop quantum cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 15:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In the context of general relativity,\nthere are many dark energy candidates to explain the observed acceleration. In\nthis work we focus our attention on two kinds of simplified Chaplygin gas\ncosmological accelerating models recently proposed in the literature. In the\nfirst scenario, the simplified Chaplygin gas works like a Quintessence model\nwhile in the second one, it plays the role of a Quartessence (an unification of\nthe dark sector). Firstly, in order to limit the free parameters of both\nmodels, we discuss the age of high redshift objects with special emphasis to\nthe old quasar APM 08279+5255 at $z = 3.91$. The basic finding is that this old\nhigh redshift object constrain severely the simplified Chaplygin cosmologies.\nSecondly, through a joint analysis involving the baryon acoustic oscillations\n(BAO) and a sample of old high redshift galaxies (OHRGs) we also estimate the\nvalue of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$. Our approach suggests that the\ncombination of these two independent phenomena provides an interesting method\nto constrain the Hubble constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 15:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-18"}
