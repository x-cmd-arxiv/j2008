The models include the multi-field\nK-inflation and the multi-field Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflation as special\ncases. We find that, in general, the sound speeds for the adiabatic and entropy\nperturbations are different and they can be smaller than 1. Then the\nnon-gaussianity can be enhanced. The multi-field DBI-inflation is shown to be a\nspecial case where both sound speeds are the same due to a special form of the\nkinetic term. We derive the exact second and third order actions including\nmetric perturbations. In the small sound speed limit and at leading order in\nthe slow-roll expansion, we derive the three point function for the curvature\nperturbation which depends on both adiabatic and entropy perturbations. The\ncontribution from the entropy perturbations has a different momentum dependence\nif the sound speed for the entropy perturbations is different from the\nadiabatic one, which provides a possibility to distinguish the multi-field\nmodels from single field models. On the other hand, in the multi-field DBI\ncase, the contribution from the entropy perturbations has the same momentum\ndependence as the pure adiabatic contributions and it only changes the\namplitude of the three point function. This could help to ease the constraints\non the DBI-inflation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 17:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-07"}

An alternative is to turn on a non-flat line bundle in the U(1)_Y\ndirection on an internal manifold, which does not have to be non-simply\nconnected. The U(1)_Y gauge field has to remain in the massless spectrum, and\nits coupling has to satisfy the GUT relation. In string theory\ncompactifications, however, it is not that easy to satisfy these conditions in\na natural way; we call it U(1)_Y problem. In this article, we explain how the\nproblem is solved in some parts of moduli space of string theory\ncompactifications. Two major ingredients are an extra strongly coupled U(1)\ngauge field and parametrically large volume for compactification that is also\nessential in accounting for the hierarchy between the Planck scale and the GUT\nscale.

Assuming that\nthe highest current density loops are restricted to circulation only within\ngrains leads to values of ~5 MA/cm2 at 5 K and self field, while whole-sample\ncurrent densities, though two orders of magnitude lower are 1000-10000 A/cm2,\nsome two orders of magnitude higher than in random polycrystalline cuprates. We\ncannot yet be certain whether this large difference in global and intragrain\ncurrent density is intrinsic to the oxypnictides or due to extrinsic barriers\nto current flow, because the samples contain significant second phase, some of\nwhich wets the grain boundaries and produces evidences of SNS proximity effect\nin the whole sample critical current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 16:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-05"}

Our code computes the relative velocity\ndistribution, and thus the accretion vs. fragmentation trend, of planetesimal\npopulations having any given size distribution. This is a critical aspect of\nplanet formation in binaries since the pericenter alignment of planetesimal\norbits due to the gravitational perturbations of the companion star and to gas\nfriction strongly depends on size. We find that, for the nominal case of a MMSN\ngas disc, the region beyond 0.5AU from the primary is hostile to planetesimal\naccretion. In this area, impact velocities between different-size bodies are\nincreased, by the differential orbital phasing, to values too high to allow\nmutual accretion. For any realistic size distribution for the planetesimal\npopulation, this accretion-inhibiting effect is the dominant collision outcome\nand the accretion process is halted. Results are robust with respect to the\nprofile and density of the gas disc: except for an unrealistic almost gas-free\ncase, the inner accretion safe area never extends beyond 0.75AU. We conclude\nthat planet formation is very difficult in the terrestrial region around alpha\nCen A, unless it started from fast-formed very large (>30km) planetesimals.\nNotwithstanding these unlikely initial conditions, the only possible\nexplanation for the presence of planets around 1 AU from the star would be the\nhypothetical outward migration of planets formed closer to the star or a\ndifferent orbital configuration in the binary's early history. Our conclusions\ndiffer from those of several studies focusing on the later embryos-to-planets\nstage, confirming that the planetesimals-to-embryos phase is more affected by\nbinary perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 16:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nproperties in the near-horizon region where gravity is strong can be quite\ndifferent for both type of objects, but at infinity it could be difficult to\ndiscern black holes from their mimickers. To disentangle this possible\nconfusion, we examine the near-horizon properties, and their connection with\nfar away properties, of some candidates to black mimickers. We study\nspherically symmetric uncharged or charged but non-extremal objects, as well as\nspherically symmetric charged extremal objects. Within the uncharged or charged\nbut non-extremal black hole mimickers, we study non-extremal\n$\\epsilon$-wormholes on the threshold of the formation of an event horizon, of\nwhich a subclass are called black foils, and gravastars. Within the charged\nextremal black hole mimickers we study extremal $\\epsilon$-wormholes on the\nthreshold of the formation of an event horizon, quasi-black holes, and\nwormholes on the basis of quasi-black holes from Bonnor stars. We elucidate,\nwhether or not the objects belonging to these two classes remain regular in the\nnear-horizon limit. The requirement of full regularity, i.e., finite curvature\nand absence of naked behavior, up to an arbitrary neighborhood of the\ngravitational radius of the object enables one to rule out potential mimickers\nin most of the cases. A list ranking the best mimickers up to the worse is\ngiven. Since, in observational astrophysics it is difficult to find extremal\nconfigurations (the best mimickers in the ranking), whereas non-extremal\nconfigurations are really bad mimickers, the task of distinguishing black holes\nfrom their mimickers seems to be less difficult than one could think of.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 19:49:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2008 22:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Moreover, these models do not reproduce a recently\nreported trend of increasing M/L with cluster mass, but instead predict\nmass-to-light ratios that are independent of cluster mass for a fixed age and\nmetallicity. This study aims to explain the M/L of globular clusters in four\ngalaxies by including stellar evolution, stellar remnants, and the preferential\nloss of low-mass stars due to energy equipartition. Analytical cluster models\nare applied that account for stellar evolution and dynamical cluster\ndissolution to samples of globular clusters in Cen A, the Milky Way, M31 and\nthe LMC. The models include stellar remnants and cover metallicities in the\nrange Z=0.0004-0.05. Both the low observed mass-to-light ratios and the trend\nof increasing M/L with cluster mass can be reproduced by including the\npreferential loss of low-mass stars, assuming reasonable values for the\ndissolution timescale. This leads to a mass-dependent M/L evolution and\nincreases the explained percentage of the observations from 39% to 92%.

We detect three main diffuse components: the Virgo ICM at\n~2.4 keV, the extended halo of M86 at ~1.2 keV, and the cooler central and\nstripped gas of M86 at ~0.8 keV. The most striking feature is a long tail of\nemission, which consists of a plume ~ 4' north of M86 and two main extensions\nemanating from the plume. Based on the morphology and temperature structure of\nthe tail, we conclude that it is formed by ram pressure stripping of M86 as it\nfalls into the Virgo cluster and interacts with the Virgo ICM, in agreement\nwith earlier work. The tail is 150 kpc in projection, and a simple estimate\ngives a lower limit on the true length of the tail of 380 kpc, making this the\nlongest ram pressure stripped tail presently known. The total gas mass in the\nplume (7x10^8 M_sun) and tail (1x10^9 M_sun) is about three times that in the\ncore of M86, which supports the scenario where most of the gas was stripped\nrapidly and recently. The projected position of the plume can be understood if\nM86 has an aspherical potential, as suggested by optical isophotes. Ram\npressure stripping from an aspherical potential can also explain the split\n\"double tails\" seen in M86 and in other Virgo cluster galaxies in the field.\nThe large line-of-sight velocity of M86 (1550 km/s with respect to M87), its\nposition relative to the Virgo cluster, and the orientation of the tail tightly\nconstrain its orbital parameters. The data are inconsistent with a radial\norbit, and imply inner and outer turning radii of r_i ~ 300 kpc and r_o > 8.8\nMpc, indicating that M86 is, at best, only weakly bound to the Virgo cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 21:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The analysis is based primarily on optical spectroscopic datasets\nsecured between 1999 and 2000 from the Bulgarian NAO, Tartu, and Ritter\nObservatories. The temporal behaviour of HD 199478 is characterised by three\nkey empirical properties: (i) systematic central velocity shifts in the\nphotospheric absorption lines, including C II and He I, over a characteristic\ntime-scale of abou 20 days; (ii) extremely strong, variable H alpha emission\nwith no clear modulation signal, and (iii) the occurrence in 2000 of a (rare)\nhigh-velocity absorption (HVA) event in H alpha, which evolved over about 60\ndays, showing the clear signature of mass infall and outflows. In these\nproperties HD 199478 resembles few other late-B SGs with peculiar emission and\nHVAs in H alpha (HD 91619, HD 34085, HD 96919). Non-LTE line synthesis\nmodelling is conducted using FASTWIND for these late-B SGs to constrain and\ncompare their fundamental parameters within the context of extreme behaviour in\nthe H alpha lines. Our analysis indicate that at the cooler temperature edge of\nB SGs, there are objects whose wind properties, as traced by H alpha, are\ninconsistent with the predictions of the smooth, spherically symmetric wind\napproximation. This discordance is still not fully understood and may highlight\nthe role of a non-spherical, disk-like, geometry, which may result from\nmagnetically-driven equatorial compression of the gas. Ordered dipole magnetic\nfields may also lead to confined plasma held above the stellar surface, which\nultimately gives rise to transient HVA events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2008 09:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These distances will allow us to identify and remove nearby\nlow-mass YSOs and help in identifying evolved stars which are weak CO emitters.\n  Method: We have used the 15 m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), the 13.7\nm telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO), the 20 m Onsala telescope\nand the 22m Mopra telescope to conduct molecular line observations towards 508\nMYSOs candidates located in the 1st and 2nd Quadrants.\n  Results: We detect 13CO emission towards 780 RMS sources which corresponds to\napproximately 84% of those observed (911).

We present an improved\ntranslational gauge theory of dislocations including the dislocation density\ntensor and the dislocation current tensor. The invariance of the variational\nprinciple under the continuous group of transformations is studied. Through\nLie's-infinitesimal invariance criterion we obtain conserved translational and\nrotational currents for the total Lagrangian made up of an elastic and\ndislocation part. We calculate the broken scaling current. Looking only on one\npart of the whole system, the conservation laws are changed into balance laws.\nBecause of the lack of translational, rotational and dilatation invariance for\neach part, a configurational force, moment and power appears. The corresponding\nJ, L and M integrals are obtained. Only isotropic and homogeneous materials are\nconsidered and we restrict ourselves to a linear theory. We choose constitutive\nlaws for the most general linear form of material isotropy. Also we give the\nconservation and balance laws corresponding to the gauge symmetry and the\naddition of solutions. From the addition of solutions we derive a reciprocity\ntheorem for the gauge theory of dislocations. Also, we derive the conservation\nlaws for stress-free states of dislocations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2008 15:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2008 13:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
