It is based\non the recent concept of Proteomic Code (for review see Biro, 2007 [1]) which\nsuggests that significant number of amino acids in specifically interacting\nproteins are coded by partially complementary codons. It means that the 1st and\n3rd residues of codons coding many co-locating amino acids are complementary\nbut the 2nd may but not necessarily complementary: like 5'-AXG-3'/3'-CXT-5'\ncodon pair, where X is any nucleotide.\n  Results: A mixture of 45 residue long, reverse, partially complementary\noligonucleotide sequences (target pool) were synthesized to selected epitopes\nof query mRNA sequences. The 2nd codon residues were randomized. The target\noligonucleotide pool was inserted into vectors, expressed and the protein\nproducts were screened for affinity to the query in Bacterial Two-Hybrid\nSystem. The best clones were used for larger-scale protein syntheses and\ncharacterization. It was possible to design and produce specific and with high\naffinity reacting (Kd:100 nM) oligopeptide reagents to GAL4 query\noligopeptides.\n  Conclusions: Second codon residue randomization is a promising method to\ndesign and produce affinity peptides to any protein sequences. The method has\nthe potential to be a rapid, inexpensive, high throughput, non-immunoglobulin\nbased alternative to recent in vivo antibody generating procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2008 23:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-22"}

Here we determine\nthe feasibility of searching for these CCSNe in metal-poor dwarf galaxies using\nvarious survey strategies. Methods: We determine oxygen abundances and\nstar-formation rates for all spectroscopically typed star-forming galaxies in\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Data Release 5, within z = 0.04. We then estimate\nthe CCSN rates for sub-samples of galaxies with differing upper-metallicity\nlimits. Using Monte-Carlo simulations we then predict the fraction of these\nCCSNe that we can expect to detect using different survey strategies. Results:\nUsing a single 2m telescope (with a standard CCD camera) search we predict a\ndetection rate of ~1.3 CCSNe/yr in galaxies with metallicities below 12 +\nlog(O/H) < 8.2 which are within a volume that will allow detailed follow-up\nwith 4m and 8m telescopes (z = 0.04).

Such behaviour is strikingly different from all previously-known\nlayered superconductors [9,11], and indicates that reduced dimensionality in\nthese compounds is not a prerequisite for high-temperature superconductivity.\nWe suggest that this situation arises because of the underlying electronic\nstructure of the iron-arsenide compounds, which appears to be much more three\ndimensional than that of the copper oxides.

Thus, a\nwell-defined value of the overdensity $\\delta_t$ is expected at the turnaround\nradius $r_t$, i.e. the radius where the Hubble flow balances the infall motion.\nWithin this scenario, we analysed the kinematical properties of a large\ncatalogue of simulated clusters, using both dark matter particles and member\ngalaxies as tracer of the infall motion.

Such bi-directional traffic occurring in a narrow channel can\neasily lead to jamming. How then is passage between the nucleus and cytoplasm\nmaintained under the varying conditions that arise during the lifetime of the\ncell? Here, we address this question using computer simulations in which the\nbehaviour of the ensemble of transporting cargoes is analyzed under different\nconditions. We suggest that traffic can exist in two distinct modes, depending\non concentration of cargoes and dissociation rates of the transport\nreceptor-cargo complexes from the pores. In one mode, which prevails when\ndissociation is quick and cargo concentration is low, transport in either\ndirection proceeds uninterrupted by the other direction. The result is that\noverall-traffic-direction fluctuates rapidly and unsystematically between\nimport and export. Remarkably, when cargo concentrations are high and\ndissociation is slow, another mode takes over in which traffic proceeds in one\ndirection for a certain extent of time, after which it flips direction for\nanother period. The switch between this, more regulated, mode of transport and\nthe other, quickly fluctuating state, does not require an active gating\nmechanism but rather occurs spontaneously through the dynamics of the\ntransported particles themselves.

It is necessary that the patterns in question act in a reproducible,\nor at least regular, manner, so that they can be identified by means of\nstatistical analysis; action on individual occasional facts cannot be proved\nstatistically, though it is hypothetically possible. As established in the\nprevious work, the first series must be constituted by microevents (Penrose R\nprocesses), that can be amplified at the macroscopic level so that they are\ntranslated at this level into a choice between alternatives. The obtained\nresult defines (by means of a structural constraint which is not, however, a\ncausal link) the choice between execution or non-execution of certain actions\non a macroscopic system S, without any feedback on the microevents source. A\nsuccession of macroevents is thus generated, which makes up the second series.\nStatistics of the events belonging to the second series is thus completely\ndefined by the probability distribution of the first series of events. In the\nabsence of a synordination, this is the a priori probability distribution,\nwhich can be measured by removing the constraint between the two series. If\nthere is synordination, the probability distribution of the two sets of events\nwill deviate in a measurable manner from the expected trend once the constraint\nis activated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2008 13:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-22"}

The problem of equivalence\nof distributions can be essentially reduced to the differential geometry of\nsuch curves.\n  The class of all 3-distributions under consideration is split into a finite\nnumber of subclasses according to the Young diagram of their flags. The local\ngeometry of distributions can be recovered from the properties of the symmetry\ngroup of so-called flat curves of flags associated with this Young diagram. In\neach subclass we describe the flat distribution and construct a canonical frame\nfor any other distribution.\n  It turns out that for n>6 in the most nontrivial case the symmetry algebra of\nthe flat distribution can be described in terms of rational normal curves\n(their secants and tangential developables) in projective spaces and its\ndimension grows exponentially with respect to n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2008 14:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-22"}

This exercise is here done by comparing the distribution of\nVirgo cluster massive and dwarf ellipticals and star forming galaxies along the\nB band effective surface brightness and effective radius vs. absolute magnitude\nrelations and the Kormendy relation to the predictions of models tracing the\neffects of ram-pressure stripping on disc galaxies entering the cluster\nenvironment and galaxy harassment. Dwarf ellipticals might have been formed\nfrom low luminosity, late-type spirals that recently entered into the cluster\nand lost their gas because of a ram-pressure stripping event, stopping their\nactivity of star formation. The perturbations induced by the abrupt decrease of\nthe star formation activity are sufficient to modify the structural properties\nof disc galaxies into those of dwarf ellipticals. Galaxy harassment induce a\ntruncation of the disc and generally an increase of the effective surface\nbrightness of the perturbed galaxies. The lack of dynamical simulations of\nperturbed galaxies spanning a wide range in luminosity prevents us to drive any\nfirm conclusion on a possible harassment-induced origin of the low surface\nbrightness dwarf elliptical galaxy population inhabiting the Virgo cluster.\nAlthough the observed scaling relations are consistent with the idea that the\ndistribution of elliptical galaxies along the mentioned scaling relation is\njust due to a gradual variation with luminosity of the Sersic index n, the\ncomparison with models indicates that dwarf ellipticals might have been formed\nby a totally different process than giant ellipticals\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2008 14:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The difficulties\nare caused by the apparent chaotic behavior of the sunspot numbers from cycle\nto cycle and by the influence of various turbulent dynamo processes, which are\nfar from understanding. For predicting the solar cycle properties we make an\ninitial attempt to use the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), a data assimilation\nmethod, which takes into account uncertainties of a dynamo model and\nmeasurements, and allows to estimate future observational data. We present the\nresults of forecasting of the solar cycles obtained by the EnKF method in\napplication to a low-mode nonlinear dynamical system modeling the solar\n$\\alpha\\Omega$-dynamo process with variable magnetic helicity. Calculations of\nthe predictions for the previous sunspot cycles show a reasonable agreement\nwith the actual data. This forecast model predicts that the next sunspot cycle\nwill be significantly weaker (by $\\sim 30%$) than the previous cycle,\ncontinuing the trend of low solar activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2008 15:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2008 16:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 20:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The underlying\ntransitions may be obtained by discretizing observed time series, or they are\ngenerated based on existing knowledge, e.g. by Boolean networks or their\nnondeterministic generalization. We use the mathematical discipline of formal\nconcept analysis (FCA), which has been applied successfully in domains as\nknowledge representation, data mining or software engineering. By the attribute\nexploration algorithm, an expert or a supporting computer program is enabled to\ndecide about the validity of a minimal set of implications and thus to\nconstruct a sound and complete knowledge base. From this all valid implications\nare derivable that relate to the selected properties of a set of genes. We\npresent results of our method for the initiation of sporulation in Bacillus\nsubtilis.
