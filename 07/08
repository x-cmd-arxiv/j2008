Cd$^{2+}$ is known as a non-essentiel HM that can\nbe harmful to plants even at low concentrations. Brassica juncea (L.) is able\nto accumulate more than 400 $\\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W. in the shoot, a physiological\ntrait which may be exploited for the phytoremediation of contaminated soils and\nwaters. . The application of 75 $\\mu$M CdCl$_2$ for three days does not show\nany effect in the B. juncea growth parameters (F.W. and D.W.) whatever the type\nof plantlets. This application decreases also the contents of chlorophyll a,\ncarotenoids and Chl a/b ratio (2.26) for plantlets regenerated in the absence\nof CdCl$_2$ but not those of plantlets regenerated in its presence. Roots have\nthe highest contents (3071; 1544 $\\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W.) followed by stems (850;\n687$\\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W.) and leaves (463; 264$\\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W.)\nrespectively. In our conditions, we suggest that the low accumulation in the\nplantlets regenerated in the presence of CdCl$_2$ by the means of in-vitro\nregeneration technology is still benefical, to some extent, for the\nphytoextraction process and seems to be an interesting technology that allows\nthe cultivation of these plantlets in contaminated soils with low accumulation\nof metal in their shoots and probably in their seeds used in many food\ntechnologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2008 16:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-08"}

Targets as faint as K=13\nwill be imaged without requiring a brighter nearby reference object. The unique\ncombination of high-dynamic-range imaging at high angular resolution and high\nspectral resolution enables a scientific program which serves a broad user\ncommunity and at the same time provides the opportunity for breakthroughs in\nmany areas of astrophysic including: probing the initial conditions for planet\nformation in the AU-scale environments of young stars; imaging convective cells\nand other phenomena on the surfaces of stars; mapping the chemical and physical\nenvironments of evolved stars, stellar remnants, and stellar winds; and\ndisentangling the central regions of active galactic nuclei and supermassive\nblack holes. VSI will provide these new capabilities using technologies which\nhave been extensively tested in the past and VSI requires little in terms of\nnew infrastructure on the VLTI. At the same time, VSI will be able to make\nmaximum use of new infrastructure as it becomes available; for example, by\ncombining 4, 6 and eventually 8 telescopes, enabling rapid imaging through the\nmeasurement of up to 28 visibilities in every wavelength channel within a few\nminutes. The current studies are focused on a 4-telescope version with an\nupgrade to a 6-telescope one. The instrument contains its own fringe tracker\nand tip-tilt control in order to reduce the constraints on the VLTI\ninfrastructure and maximize the scientific return.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2008 16:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

To\nstudy these imprints we simulate Monte Carlo CMB maps, which are statistically\nanisotropic due to the correlations between CMB multipoles induced by the\nmagnetic field.

These stellar companions normally exist at large\ndistances from the planetary systems (typical projected binary separations are\non the orders 100-10000AU) and are often faint (ranging from F to T spectral\ntypes). Yet, secular cyclic angular momentum exchange with these distant\nstellar companions can significantly alter the orbital configuration of the\nplanets around the primaries. One of the most interesting and fairly common\noutcomes seen in numerical simulations is the opening of a large mutual\ninclination angle between the planetary orbits, forced by differential nodal\nprecessions caused by the binary companion. The growth of the mutual\ninclination angle between planetary orbits induces additional large-amplitude\neccentricity oscillations of the inner planet due to the quadrupole\ngravitational perturbation by the outer planet. This eccentricity oscillation\nmay eventually result in the orbital decay of the inner planet through tidal\nfriction, as previously proposed as Kozai migration or Kozai cycles with tidal\nfriction (KCTF). This orbital decay mechanism induced by the binary\nperturbation and subsequent tidal dissipation may stand as an alternative\nformation channel for close-in extrasolar planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2008 20:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our study is motivated by the tight user-network\ncoupling in future mobile societies. In such a paradigm, messages are sent to\ninferred behavioral profiles, instead of explicit IDs. Our paper provides a\nsystematic framework in providing such services. First, user behavioral\nprofiles are constructed based on traces collected from two large wireless\nnetworks, and their spatio-temporal stability is analyzed. The implicit\nrelationship discovered between mobile users could be utilized to provide a\nservice for message delivery and discovery in various network environments. As\nan example application, we provide a detailed design of such a service in\nchallenged opportunistic network architecture, named CSI. We provide a fully\ndistributed solution using behavioral profile space gradients and small world\nstructures.\n  Our analysis shows that user behavioral profiles are surprisingly stable,\ni.e., the similarity of the behavioral profile of a user to its future\nbehavioral profile is above 0.8 for two days and 0.75 for one week, and remains\nabove 0.6 for five weeks. The correlation coefficient of the similarity metrics\nbetween a user pair at different time instants is above 0.7 for four days, 0.62\nfor a week, and remains above 0.5 for two weeks. Leveraging such a stability in\nuser behaviors, the CSI service achieves delivery rate very close to the\ndelay-optimal strategy (above 94%), with minimal overhead (less than 84% of the\noptimal). We believe that this new paradigm will act as an enabler of multiple\nnew services in mobile societies, and is potentially applicable in\nserver-based, heterogeneous or infrastructure-less wireless environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2008 01:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-09"}

The SIP server overload problem is interesting\nespecially because the costs of serving or rejecting a SIP session can be\nsimilar. For this reason, the built-in SIP overload control mechanism based on\ngenerating rejection messages cannot prevent the server from entering\ncongestion collapse under heavy load. The SIP overload problem calls for a\npushback control solution in which the potentially overloaded receiving server\nmay notify its upstream sending servers to have them send only the amount of\nload within the receiving server's processing capacity. The pushback framework\ncan be achieved by either a rate-based feedback or a window-based feedback. The\ncenterpiece of the feedback mechanism is the algorithm used to generate load\nregulation information. We propose three new window-based feedback algorithms\nand evaluate them together with two existing rate-based feedback algorithms. We\ncompare the different algorithms in terms of the number of tuning parameters\nand performance under both steady and variable load.

To prevent a player from winning by blocking\ntime, we restrict each player to strategies that ensure that the player cannot\nbe responsible for causing a zeno run. First, we present an efficient reduction\nof these games to turn-based (i.e., nonconcurrent) finite-state (i.e., untimed)\nparity games. The states of the resulting game are pairs of clock regions of\nthe original game. Our reduction improves the best known complexity for solving\ntimed parity games. Moreover, the rich class of algorithms for classical parity\ngames can now be applied to timed parity games.\n  Second, we consider two restricted classes of strategies for the player that\nrepresents the controller in a real-time synthesis problem, namely,\nlimit-robust and bounded-robust strategies. Using a limit-robust strategy, the\ncontroller cannot choose an exact real-valued time delay but must allow for\nsome nonzero jitter in each of its actions. If there is a given lower bound on\nthe jitter, then the strategy is bounded-robust. We show that exact strategies\nare more powerful than limit-robust strategies, which are more powerful than\nbounded-robust strategies for any bound.

We\npropose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies at\nz~2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. High\nredshift disks exhibit large random motions. This turbulence may in part be\nstirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid cold accretion\nflows along the filaments of the cosmic web. As a result dynamical friction and\nviscous processes proceed on a time scale of <1 Gyr, at least an order of\nmagnitude faster than in z~0 disk galaxies. Early secular evolution thus drives\ngas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks and\nmassive bulges, even without major mergers. Secular evolution along with\nincreased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also help\nto account for the short time scales of the stellar buildup observed in massive\ngalaxies at z~2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2008 07:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The force constant matrices are obtained from standard\nquantum chemistry software. The phonon transmission and thermal conductance are\nfrom the nonequilibrium Green's function and the mode-matching method. We find\nthat the ballistic thermal conductance is not sensitive to the compression or\nstretching of the molecular junction. The terminating groups of the SWCNTs at\nthe cutting edges only influence the thermal conductance quantitatively. The\nconductance of the benzene and alkane chains shows large difference. Analysis\nof the transmission spectrum shows that (i) the low temperature thermal\nconductance is mainly contributed by the SWCNT transverse acoustic modes, (ii)\nthe degenerate phonon modes show different transmission probability due to the\npresence of molecular junction, (iii) the SWCNT twisting mode can hardly be\ntransmitted by the alkane chain. As a result, the ballistic thermal conductance\nof alkane chains is larger than that of benzene chains below 38 K, while it is\nsmaller at higher temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2008 08:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-02"}

One is a nanometer-thick small mesa structure with only two or\nthree IJJs and the other is a stack of a few hundreds of IJJs on a narrow\nbridge structure. Experimental results of switching current distribution for\nthe first switching events from zero-voltage state showed a good agreement with\nthe conventional theory for a single Josephson junction, indicating that a\ncrossover temperature from thermal activation to MQT regime for the former\ndevice structure was as high as that for the latter device structure. Together\nwith the observation of multiphoton transitions between quantized energy levels\nin MQT regime, these results strongly suggest that the observed MQT behavior is\nintrinsic to a single IJJ in high-$T_c$ cuprates, independent of device\nstructures. The switching current distribution for the second switching events\nfrom the first resistive state, which were carefully distinguished from the\nfirst switchings, was also compared between two device structures. In spite of\nthe difference in the heat transfer environment, the second switching events\nfor both devices were found to show a similar temperature-independent behavior\nup to a much higher temperature than the crossover temperature for the first\nswitching. We argue that it cannot be explained in terms of the self-heating\nowing to dissipative currents after the first switching.

With the aim to assess the\ninfluence of the stellar iron content on the PL relation in the V and K bands,\nwe have related the V-band and the K-band residuals from the standard PL\nrelations of Freedman et al.

We proceed as follows: Introducing a novel\napproach to identify strong shock fronts in an SPH simulation, we determine the\nMach number as well as the downstream density and temperature in the\nMareNostrum Universe simulation which has 2x1024^3 particles in a 500 Mpc/h box\nand was carried out with non-radiative physics.

These disks are detected because dust is\ncreated in the destruction of planetesimals in the disks much in the same way\nthat dust is produced in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt in the solar system.\nFor the nearest stars the structure of their debris disks can be directly\nimaged, showing a wide variety of both axisymmetric and asymmetric structures.\nA successful interpretation of these images requires a knowledge of the\ndynamics of small bodies in planetary systems, since this allows the observed\ndust distribution to be deconvolved to provide information on the distribution\nof larger objects, such as planetesimals and planets. This chapter reviews the\nstructures seen in debris disks, and describes a disk dynamical theory which\ncan be used to interpret those observations. In this way much of the observed\nstructures, both axisymmetric and asymmetric, can be explained by a model in\nwhich the dust is produced in a planetesimal belt which is perturbed by a\nnearby, as yet unseen, planet.

We consider the oscillations of a magnetic straight\ncylinder with fixed-ends under the influence of an external driver modeling the\nforce due to the global EIT wave. Given the uncertainties related to the nature\nof EIT waves, we first approximate the driver by an oscillatory force in time\nand later by a shock with a finite width. Results show that for a harmonic\ndriver the dominant period in the generated oscillation belongs to the driver.\nDepending on the period of driver, compared to the natural periods of the loop,\na mixture of standing modes harmonics can be initiated. In the case of a\nnon-harmonic driver (modeling a shock wave), the generated oscillations in the\nloop are the natural periods only. The amplitude of oscillations is determined\nby the position of the driver along the tube. The full diagnosis of generated\noscillations is achieved using simple numerical methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2008 15:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Much emphasis is given\nto two- and three-dimensional devices containing many interacting particles of\none or more species; for this class of artificial motors, noise rectification\nresults also from the interplay of particle Brownian motion and geometric\nconstraints. Recently, selective control and optimization of the transport of\ninteracting colloidal particles and magnetic vortices have been successfully\nachieved, thus leading to the new generation of microfluidic and\nsuperconducting devices presented hereby.
