Namely, if the\nvalue of Om(z) is the same at different redshifts, then DE is exactly\ncosmological constant. The slope of Om(z) can differentiate between different\nmodels of dark energy even if the value of the matter density is not accurately\nknown. For DE with an unevolving equation of state, a positive slope of Om(z)\nis suggestive of Phantom (w < -1) while a negative slope indicates Quintessence\n(w > -1). The second diagnostic, \"acceleration probe\"(q-probe), is the mean\nvalue of the deceleration parameter over a small redshift range. It can be used\nto determine the cosmological redshift at which the universe began to\naccelerate, again without reference to the current value of the matter density.\nWe apply the \"Om\" and \"q-probe\" diagnostics to the Union data set of type Ia\nsupernovae combined with recent data from the cosmic microwave background\n(WMAP5) and baryon acoustic oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2008 17:40:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 18:44:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 20:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

While\nwarm dust can explain the late-time K_s-band emission of SN 2005ip, the nature\nof the dust heating source is ambiguous. Shock heating of pre-existing dust by\npost-shocked gas is unlikely because the forward shock is moving too slowly to\nhave traversed the expected dust-free cavity by the time observations first\nreveal the K_s emission. While an infrared light echo model correctly predicts\na near-infrared luminosity plateau, heating dust to the observed temperatures\nof ~1400-1600 K at a relatively large distance from the supernova (> 10^{18}\ncm) requires an extraordinarily high early supernova luminosity (~1 X 10^{11}\nL_solar). The evidence instead favors condensing dust in the cool, dense shell\nbetween the forward and reverse shocks.

Years worth of time\nordered data (TOD) from thousands of detectors will need to be compressed into\nmaps of the T, Q and U Stokes parameters. Fundamental to the science goal of\nthese experiments, the observation of B-modes, is the ability to control noise\nand systematics. In this paper, we consider an alternative to the\nmaximum-likelihood method, called destriping, where the noise is modelled as a\nset of discrete offset functions and then subtracted from the time-stream. We\ncompare our destriping code (Descart: the DEStriping CARTographer) to a full\nmaximum-likelihood map-maker, applying them to 200 Monte-Carlo simulations of\ntime-ordered data from a ground based, partial-sky polarisation modulation\nexperiment. In these simulations, the noise is dominated by either detector or\natmospheric 1/f noise. Using prior information of the power spectrum of this\nnoise, we produce destriped maps of T, Q and U which are negligibly different\nfrom optimal. The method does not filter the signal or bias the E or B-mode\npower spectra. Depending on the length of the destriping baseline, the method\ndelivers between 5 and 22 times improvement in computation time over the\nmaximum-likelihood algorithm. We find that, for the specific case of single\ndetector maps, it is essential to destripe the atmospheric 1/f in order to\ndetect B-modes, even though the Q and U signals are modulated by a half-wave\nplate spinning at 5-Hz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2008 17:32:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 12:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-16"}

Central to this picture is a putative accretion disk which is\nbelieved to be the source of the majority of the radiative output. It is well\nknown, however, that the most extensively studied disk model -- an optically\nthick disk which is heated locally by the dissipation of gravitational binding\nenergy -- is apparently contradicted by observations in a few major respects.\nIn particular, the model predicts a specific blue spectral shape asymptotically\nfrom the visible to the near-infrared, but this is not generally seen in the\nvisible wavelength region where the disk spectrum is observable. A crucial\ndifficulty was that, toward the infrared, the disk spectrum starts to be hidden\nunder strong hot dust emission from much larger but hitherto unresolved scales,\nand thus has essentially been impossible to observe. Here we report\nobservations of polarized light interior to the dust-emiting region that enable\nus to uncover this near-infrared disk spectrum in several quasars. The revealed\nspectra show that the near-infrared disk spectrum is indeed as blue as\npredicted. This indicates that, at least for the outer near-infrared-emitting\nradii, the standard picture of the locally heated disk is approximately\ncorrect. The model problems at shorter wavelengths should then be directed\ntoward a better understanding of the inner parts of the revealed disk. The\nnewly uncovered disk emission at large radii, with more future measurements,\nwill also shed totally new light on the unanswered critical question of how and\nwhere the disk ends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2008 19:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Oxygen-rich stars in the\nGalaxy and in lower metallicity galaxies have similar mass-loss rates only at\nhigh luminosities.

In the so-called local\napproximation, the isovector density is inversely proportional to the symmetry\nenergy in uniform matter at the local isoscalar density.

We show that\nsuperstructure Mottness emerges in an inhomogeneous electron system when the\nsuperstructure contains an odd number of electrons per supercell. We argue that\nsuperstructure Mottness exists even in the absence of translation symmetry\nbreaking by a superlattice, provided that the extended or intersite Coulomb\ninteraction is strong. In the latter case, superstructure Mottness offers a\nunifying framework for the Mott and Wigner physics and a nonperturbative,\nstrong coupling description of the Wigner-Mott transition. We support our\nproposal by studying a minimal single-band ionic Hubbard $t$-$U$-$V$-$\\Delta$\nmodel with nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V$ and a two-sublattice ionic\npotential $\\Delta$. The model is mapped onto a Hubbard model with two effective\n``orbitals'' representing the two sites within the supercell, the intra and\ninterorbital Coulomb repulsion $U$ and $U^\\prime \\sim V$, and a crystal field\nsplitting $\\Delta$. Charge order on the original lattice corresponds to orbital\norder. Developing a cluster Gutzwiller approximation, we study the effects and\nthe interplay between $V$ and $\\Delta$ on the Mott and Wigner-Mott transitions\nat quarter-filling. We provide the mechanism by which the superlattice\npotential enhances the correlation effects and the tendency towards local\nmoment formation, construct and elucidate the phase diagram in the unifying\nframework of superstructure Mottness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2008 01:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 04:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-01"}

Most of binary mergers numerical simulations\nwere carried out with the purpose of investigating the emission of\ngravitational waves. Such a scenario consists of an inspiral, merging and\nringdown phase. In this paper we present the comparison of the observational\nresults and analytical predictions for a test particle in a quasicircular orbit\naround the BH. The emission of gravitational waves causes a rapid decrease of\nthe orbital radius and a rise of a {\\it chirp} of radiation. Matter orbiting\nthe black hole would be expected to produce high-frequency oscillations (HFO).\nTimescales of the coalescence process are of the order of milliseconds and\noscillation frequencies of hundreds Hz for a system with a solar mass BH\ncompanion. We report on the detection of HFO in two short gamma-ray bursts in\nthis paper. The frequencies and durations of the oscillations are in agreement\nwith the predicted values. A {\\it chirp} phenomenon is identified also.

We show that the\nseparation of family members from background interlopers can be improved with\nthe aid of SDSS colors as a qualifier for family membership. Based on an\n~88,000 object subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Moving Object Catalog 4\nwith available proper orbital elements, we define 37 statistically robust\nasteroid families with at least 100 members using a simple Gaussian\ndistribution model in both orbital and color space. The interloper rejection\nrate based on colors is typically ~10% for a given orbital family definition,\nwith four families that can be reliably isolated only with the aid of colors.\nAbout 50% of all objects in this data set belong to families, and this fraction\nvaries from about 35% for objects brighter than an H magnitude of 13 and rises\nto 60% for objects fainter than this. The fraction of C-type objects in\nfamilies decreases with increasing H magnitude for H > 13, while the fraction\nof S-type objects above this limit remains effectively constant. This suggests\nthat S-type objects require a shorter timescale for equilibrating the\nbackground and family size distributions via collisional processing. The size\ndistributions for 15 families display a well-defined change of slope and can be\nmodeled as a \"broken\" double power-law. Such \"broken\" size distributions are\ntwice as likely for S-type familes than for C-type families, and are dominated\nby dynamically old families. The remaining families with size distributions\nthat can be modeled as a single power law are dominated by young families. When\nsize distribution requires a double power-law model, the two slopes are\ncorrelated and are steeper for S-type families.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2008 00:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

We consider the relative importance of cooling due to baryonic\nradiative processes and heating due to WIMP annihilation. We analyze the dark\nmatter and gas profiles of several halos formed in cosmological-scale numerical\nsimulations. The heating rate depends sensitively on the dark matter density\nprofile, which we approximate with a power law rho_chi ~ r^{-alpha_chi}, in the\nnumerically unresolved inner regions of the halo. If we assume a self-similar\nstructure so that alpha_chi ~= 1.5 as measured on the resolved scales ~1pc,\nthen for a fiducial WIMP mass of 100GeV, the heating rate is typically much\nsmaller (<10^{-3}) than the cooling rate for densities up to\nn_H=10^{17}cm^{-3}. In one case, where alpha_chi=1.65, the heating rate becomes\nsimilar to the cooling rate by a density of n_H=10^{15}cm^{-3}. The dark matter\ndensity profile is expected to steepen in the central baryon-dominated region\n<~1pc due to adiabatic contraction, and we observe this effect (though with\nrelatively low resolution) in our numerical models. From these we estimate\nalpha_chi~=2.0. The heating now dominates cooling above n_H~=10^{14}cm^{-3}, in\nagreement with the previous study of Spolyar, Freese & Gondolo. We expect this\nleads to the formation of an equilibrium structure with a baryonic and dark\nmatter density distribution exhibiting a flattened central core. Examining such\nequilibria, we find total luminosities due to WIMP annihilation are relatively\nconstant and ~10^3 L_sun, set by the radiative luminosity of the baryonic core.\nWe discuss the implications for Pop III.1 star formation...

This represents the most extensive campaign so far organized\non any solar-type oscillator. We describe in detail the methods we used for\nprocessing and combining the data. These involved calculating weights for the\nvelocity time series from the measurement uncertainties and adjusting them in\norder to minimize the noise level of the combined data. The time series of\nvelocities for Procyon shows the clear signature of oscillations, with a\nplateau of excess power that is centred at 0.9 mHz and is broader than has been\nseen for other stars. The mean amplitude of the radial modes is 38.1 +/- 1.3\ncm/s (2.0 times solar), which is consistent with previous detections from the\nground and by the WIRE spacecraft, and also with the upper limit set by the\nMOST spacecraft. The variation of the amplitude during the observing campaign\nallows us to estimate the mode lifetime to be 1.5 d (+1.9/-0.8 d). We also find\na slow variation in the radial velocity of Procyon, with good agreement between\ndifferent telescopes. These variations are remarkably similar to those seen in\nthe Sun, and we interpret them as being due to rotational modulation from\nactive regions on the stellar surface. The variations appear to have a period\nof about 10 days, which presumably equals the stellar rotation period or,\nperhaps, half of it. The amount of power in these slow variations indicates\nthat the fractional area of Procyon covered by active regions is slightly\nhigher than for the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2008 05:27:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2008 23:33:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 05:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In contrast with\nEulerian diagnostics, Lagrangian tools like the local Lyapunov exponents have\nthe advantage of exploiting both spatial and temporal variability of the\nvelocity field and are in principle able to unveil subgrid filaments generated\nby chaotic stirring. However, one may wonder whether this theoretical advantage\nis of practical interest in real-data, mesoscale and submesoscale analysis,\nbecause of the uncertainties and resolution of altimetric products, and the\nnon-passive nature of biogeochemical tracers. Here we compare the ability of\nstandard Eulerian diagnostics and the finite-size Lyapunov exponent in\ndetecting instantaneaous and climatological transport and mixing properties. By\ncomparing with sea-surface temperature patterns, we find that the two\ndiagnostics provide similar results for slowly evolving eddies like the first\nAlboran gyre. However, the Lyapunov exponent is also able to predict the\n(sub-)mesoscale filamentary process occuring along the Algerian current and\nabove the Balearic Abyssal Plain. Such filaments are also observed, with some\nmismatch, in sea-surface temperature patterns. Climatologies of Lyapunov\nexponents do not show any compact relation with other Eulerian diagnostics,\nunveiling a different structure even at the basin scale. We conclude that\nfilamentation dynamics can be detected by reprocessing available altimetric\ndata with Lagrangian tools, giving insight into (sub-)mesoscale stirring\nprocesses relevant to tracer observations and complementing traditional\nEulerian diagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2008 10:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-14"}

In\nevery cycle of the iterative interplay between the forward process (spectral\nsynthesis) and the inverse process (derivative based optimization) the Stokes\nprofile synthesis requires several thousand evaluations of the polarized\nradiative transfer equation for a given stellar surface model. To cope with\nthese computational demands and to allow for the incorporation of a full Stokes\nprofile synthesis into Doppler- and Zeeman-Doppler imaging applications as well\nas into large scale solar Stokes profile inversions, we present a novel fast\nand accurate synthesis method for calculating local Stokes profiles. Our\napproach is based on artificial neural network models, which we use to\napproximate the complex non-linear mapping between the most important\natmospheric parameters and the corresponding Stokes profiles. A number of\nspecialized artificial neural networks, are used to model the functional\nrelation between the model atmosphere, magnetic field strength, field\ninclination, and field azimuth, on one hand and the individual components\n(I,Q,U,V) of the Stokes profiles, on the other hand. We performed an extensive\nstatistical evaluation and show that our new approach yields accurate local as\nwell as disk-integrated Stokes profiles over a wide range of atmospheric\nconditions. The mean rms errors for the Stokes I and V profiles are well below\n0.2% compared to the exact numerical solution. Errors for Stokes Q and U are in\nthe range of 1%.

Roughly 100 quasars at z<0.75 were\nselected by matching objects from the QUEST1 Variability Survey with\nbroad-lined objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Black hole masses were\nestimated with the virial method using the broad Hbeta line, and variability\nwas characterized from the QUEST1 light curves. The correlation between black\nhole mass and variability amplitude is significant at the 99% level or better\nand does not appear to be caused by obvious selection effects inherent to\nflux-limited samples. It is most evident for rest frame time lags of the order\na few months up to the QUEST1 maximum temporal resolution of about 2 years. The\ncorrelation between black hole mass and variability amplitude means that the\nmore massive black holes have larger percentage flux variations. Over 2-3\norders of magnitude in black hole mass, the amplitude increases by\napproximately 0.2 mag. A likely explanation for the correlation is that the\nmore massive black holes are starving and produce larger flux variations\nbecause they do not have a steady inflow of gaseous fuel. Assuming that the\nvariability arises from changes in the accretion rate Li & Cao [8] show that\nflux variations similar to those observed are expected as a consequence of the\nmore massive black holes having cooler accretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2008 12:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These synonymous codons are not used\nequally; there is a Codon Usage Bias (CUB). This article will provide novel\ninformation about the origin and evolution of this bias.\n  Results: Codon Usage Bias (CUB, defined here as deviation from equal usage of\nsynonymous codons) was studied in 113 species. The average CUB was 29.3 +/-\n1.1% (S.E.M, n=113) of the theoretical maximum and declined progressively with\nevolution and increasing genome complexity. A Pan-Genomic Codon Usage Frequency\n(CUF) Table was constructed to describe genome-wide relationships among codons.\nSignificant correlations were found between the number of synonymous codons and\n(i) the frequency of the respective amino acids (ii) the size of CUB. Numerous,\nstatistically highly significant, internal correlations were found among codons\nand the nucleic acids they comprise. These strong correlations made it possible\nto predict missing synonymous codons (wobble bases) reliably from the remaining\ncodons or codon residues.\n  Conclusions: The results put the concept of \"codon bias\" into a novel\nperspective. The internal connectivity of codons indicates that all synonymous\ncodons might be integrated parts of the Genetic Code with equal importance in\nmaintaining its functional integrity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2008 14:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-25"}

The results\ndemonstrate that coordinate-space studies are sensitive to the recent (0-8\nGyears ago) merger histories of galaxies (this timescale corresponds to the\nlast few to tens of percent of mass accretion for a Milky-Way-type galaxy).\nSpecifically, the {\\it frequency, sky coverage} and {\\it fraction of stars} in\nsubstructures in the stellar halo as a function of surface brightness are\nindicators of the importance of recent merging and of the luminosity function\nof infalling dwarfs. The {\\it morphology} of features serves as a guide to the\norbital distribution of those dwarfs. Constraints on the earlier merger history\n(> 8 Gyears ago) can be gleaned from the abundance patterns in halo stars:\nwithin our models, dramatic differences in the dominant epoch of accretion or\nluminosity function of progenitor objects leave clear signatures in the\n[alpha/Fe] and [Fe/H] distributions of the stellar halo - halos dominated by\nvery early accretion have higher average [alpha/Fe], while those dominated by\nhigh luminosity satellites have higher [Fe/H]. This intuition can be applied to\nreconstruct much about the merger histories of nearby galaxies from current and\nfuture data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2008 15:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The symmetric capacity is the highest\nrate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal\nprobability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to\nsynthesize, out of $N$ independent copies of a given B-DMC $W$, a second set of\n$N$ binary-input channels $\\{W_N^{(i)}:1\\le i\\le N\\}$ such that, as $N$ becomes\nlarge, the fraction of indices $i$ for which $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near 1\napproaches $I(W)$ and the fraction for which $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near 0\napproaches $1-I(W)$. The polarized channels $\\{W_N^{(i)}\\}$ are\nwell-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate 1 through\nthose with capacity near 1 and at rate 0 through the remaining. Codes\nconstructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes. The paper proves\nthat, given any B-DMC $W$ with $I(W)>0$ and any target rate $R < I(W)$, there\nexists a sequence of polar codes $\\{{\\mathscr C}_n;n\\ge 1\\}$ such that\n${\\mathscr C}_n$ has block-length $N=2^n$, rate $\\ge R$, and probability of\nblock error under successive cancellation decoding bounded as $P_{e}(N,R) \\le\n\\bigoh(N^{-\\frac14})$ independently of the code rate.
