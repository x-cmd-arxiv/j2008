We\nfind a strong (S/N$>$6) detection of $Q_3$ on scales of 55-125 Mpc/h, with a\nwell defined peak around 105 Mpc/h in all \\xi_2, \\xi_3 and Q_3, in excellent\nagreement with the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the baryon\nacoustic oscillations (BAO). We use very large simulations to asses and test\nthe significance of our measurement. Models without the BAO peak are ruled out\nby the $Q_3$ data with 99% confidence. Our measurements show the expected shape\nfor Q_3 as a function of the triangular configuration. This provides a first\ndirect measurement of the non-linear mode coupling coefficients of density and\nvelocity fluctuations which, on these large scales, are independent of cosmic\ntime, the amplitude of fluctuations or cosmological parameters. The location of\nthe BAO peak in the data indicates \\Omega_m =0.28 \\pm 0.05 and \\Omega_B=0.079\n\\pm 0.025 (h=0.70) after marginalization over spectral index (n_s=0.8-1.2)\nlinear b_1 and quadratic c_2 bias,which are found to be in the range:\nb_1=1.7-2.2 and c_2=0.75-3.55. The data allows a hierarchical contribution from\nprimordial non-Gaussianities in the range Q_3=0.55-3.35. These constraints are\nindependent and complementary to the ones that can be obtained using the\n2-point function, which are presented in a separate paper. This is the first\ndetection of the shape of $Q_3$ on BAO scales, but our errors are shot-noise\ndominated and the SDSS volume is still relatively small, so there is ample room\nfor future improvement in this type of measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2008 19:22:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2008 09:51:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 May 2009 21:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The temperature dependence of\nthe magnetic moment shows excellent agreement with not only that of the muon\nprecession frequency but also with that of the structural distortion, revealing\nthe strong coupling of the columnar magnetic order and the structural\ndistortion in SrFe$_2$As$_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2008 19:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-06"}

In the\n\\emph{annealed} large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical process of\nwords, the rate function is the specific relative entropy of the observed law\nof words w.r.t. the reference law of words. In the present paper we consider\nthe \\emph{quenched} LDP, i.e., we condition on a typical letter sequence. We\nfocus on the case where the renewal process has an \\emph{algebraic} tail. The\nrate function turns out to be a sum of two terms, one being the annealed rate\nfunction, the other being proportional to the specific relative entropy of the\nobserved law of letters w.r.t. the reference law of letters, with the former\nbeing obtained by concatenating the words and randomising the location of the\norigin. The proportionality constant equals the tail exponent of the renewal\nprocess.

The\nresults presented here follow the previously reported observations carried out\nin March 2006 on a similar but unrelated set of sources.\n  Interstellar extinction in the inner regions of the galactic bulge amounts to\ntens of magnitudes at visual wavelengths. As a consequence, the majority of\nsources in that area are poorly studied and large numbers of potentially\ninteresting sources such as late-type giants with circumstellar shells, stellar\nmasers, infrared stars, remain excluded from the typical investigations which\nare carried out in less problematic regions. Also undetected are a large\nnumbers of binaries. By observing LO events in this region, we gain the means\nto investigate at least a selected number of sources with an unprecedented\ncombination of sensitivity and angular resolution. The LO technique permits to\nachieve mas resolution with a sensitivity of K~12mag at a very large telescope.\nWe have used the opportunity of a favorable passage of the Moon over a crowded\nregion in the general direction of the Galactic Center to observe 78 LO events\nof heavily reddened stellar sources. We have detected six new binary and one\ntriple star, with typical projected separation of ~0.01\". We have also detected\nthe compact circumstellar emission around one maser and one central star of a\nplanetary nebula.

In the honeycomb arrays,\nit is possible for the interstitial vortices to form dimer or higher n-mer\nstates which have an additional orientational degree of freedom that can lead\nto the formation of vortex molecular crystals. For filling fractions where\ndimer states appear, a novel dynamical symmetry breaking can occur when the\ndimers flow in one of two possible alignment directions. This leads to\ntransport in the direction transverse to the applied drive. We show that\ndimerization produces distinct types of moving phases which depend on the\ndirection of the driving force with respect to the pinning lattice symmetry.\nWhen the dimers are driven along certain directions, a reorientation of the\ndimers can produce a jamming phenomenon which results in a strong enhancement\nin the critical depinning force. The jamming can also cause unusual effects\nsuch as an increase in the critical depinning force when the size of the\npinning sites is reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2008 22:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A recent, detailed study of the well-known solar wind disappearance\nevent of 11 May 1999 traced its origin to a coronal hole (CH) lying adjacent to\na large active region (AR), AR8525 in Carrington rotation 1949. The AR was\nlocated at central meridian on 05 May 1999 when the flows responsible for this\nevent began. We examine the evolution of the AR-CH complex during 5-6 May 1999\nto study the changes that apparently played a key role in causing this\ndisappearance event. Aims. To study the evolution of the solar source region of\nthe disappearance event of 11 May 1999. Methods. Using images from the Soft\nX-ray Telescope (SXT), the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) and the\nMichelson Doppler Imager (MDI) to examine the evolution of the CH and AR\ncomplex at the source region of the disappearance event. Results. We find a\ndynamic evolution taking place in the CH-AR boundary at the source region of\nthe disappearance event of 11 May 1999. This evolution, which is found to\nreduce the area of the CH, is accompanied by the formation of new loops in EUV\nimages that are spatially and temporally correlated with emerging flux regions\nas seen in MDI data. Conclusions. In the period leading up to the disappearance\nevent of 11 May 1999, our observations, during quiet solar conditions and in\nthe absence of CMEs, provide the first clear evidence for Sun-Earth connection\noriginating from an evolving AR-CH region located at central meridian.

The recent star formation in the blue BCGs typically has an age\nless than 200 Myrs and contributes mass fractions of less than a percent.\nAlthough the sample studied here is small, we demonstrate, for the first time,\na one-to-one correspondence between blue cores in elliptical galaxies (in\nparticular BCGs) and a NUV-enhancement observed using GALEX. The combination of\nthis one-to-one correspondence and the consistently young age of recent star\nformation, coupled with additional correlations with the host cluster's X-ray\nproperties, strongly suggests that the star formation is fueled by gas cooling\nout of the intracluster medium.

In this paper we combine the pattern-of-zero\napproach and the conformal-field-theory (CFT) approach to calculate the\ntopological properties of quasiparticles. We discuss how the quasiparticles in\nFQH states naturally form representations of a magnetic translation algebra,\nwith members of a representation differing from each other by Abelian\nquasiparticles. We find that this structure dramatically simplifies topological\nproperties of the quasiparticles, such as their fusion rules, charges, and\nscaling dimensions, and has consequences for the ground state degeneracy of FQH\nstates on higher genus surfaces. We find constraints on the pattern of zeros of\nquasiparticles that can fuse together, which allow us to obtain the fusion\nrules of quasiparticles from their pattern of zeros, at least in the case of\nthe (generalized and composite) parafermion states.

This opens the possibility of treating 1+1\ndimensional dynamical situations of great interest in quantum gravity taking\ninto account the full dynamics of the theory and preserving the space-time\ncovariance at a quantum level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2008 15:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-16"}

For example, the thermoelectric\npower, that is the voltage that develops across a sample in response to a\ntemperature gradient, changes sign abruptly near optimal doping in a wide class\nof cuprates, a stark departure from the standard theory of metals in which the\nthermopower vanishes only when one electron exists per site. We show that this\neffect arises from proximity to a state in which particle-hole symmetry is\ndynamically generated. The operative mechanism is dynamical spectral weight\ntransfer from states that lie at least 2eV away from the chemical potential. We\nshow that the sign change is reproduced quantitatively within the Hubbard model\nfor moderate values of the on-site repulsion, $U$. For sufficiently large\nvalues of on-site repulsion, for example, $U=20t$, ($t$ the hopping matrix\nelement), dynamical spectral weight transfer attenuates and our calculated\nresults for the thermopower are in prefect agreement with exact atomic limit.\nThe emergent particle-hole symmetry close to optimal doping points to pairing\nin the cuprates being driven by high-energy electronic states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2008 20:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 23:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2010 21:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
