We\nhave employed numerical simulations and the analytical augmented-moment method\nwhich is the second-order moment method for local and global variables [H.\nHasegawa, Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 67}, 041903 (2003)]. It has been shown that the\nsynchrony of an ensemble is increased (decreased) by a positive (negative)\nspatial correlation in both additive and multiplicative noise. Although the\nvariability for local fluctuations is almost insensitive to spatial\ncorrelations, that for global fluctuations is increased (decreased) by positive\n(negative) correlations. When a pulse input is applied, the synchrony is\nincreased for the correlated multiplicative noise, whereas it may be decreased\nfor correlated additive noise coexisting with uncorrelated multiplicative\nnoise. An application of our study to neuron ensembles has demonstrated the\npossibility that information is conveyed by the variance and synchrony in input\nsignals, which accounts for some neuronal experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jul 2008 23:14:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2008 19:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2008 19:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 20:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The relay pair provides such\nassistance while handling a private message. We assume that users can use the\npast channel outputs and can transmit and receive at the same time and in the\nsame frequency band. In this collaborative scheme, the transmitter of the\nsource pair splits its information into two independent parts. Ironically, the\nrelay pair employs the decode and forward coding to assist the source pair in\ndelivering a part of its message and re-encodes the decoded message along with\nprivate message, which is intended to the receiver of the relay pair, and\nbroadcasts the results. The receiver of the relay pair decodes both messages,\nretrieves the private message, re-encodes and transmits the decoded massage to\nthe intended destination. We also characterize the achievable rate region for\nGaussian PCN. Finally, we provide numerical results to study the rate trade off\nfor the involved pairs. Numerical result shows that the collaboration offers\ngain when the channel gain between the users of the relay pair are strong. It\nalso shows that if the channel conditions between transmitters or between the\nreceivers of the relay and source pairs are poor, such a collaboration is not\nbeneficial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jul 2008 16:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-08"}

The presence of GWs will perturb the electromagnetic (EM)\nfields, giving rise to perturbed photon fluxes (PPFs). After being reflected by\na fractal membrane, the perturbed photons suffer little decay and can be\nmeasured by a microwave receiver. This idea has been explored to certain extent\nas a method for very high frequency gravitational waves. In this paper, we\nexamine and develop this method more extensively, and confront the possible\ndetection with the predicted signal of relic gravitational waves (RGWs). A\nmaser beam with high linear polarization is used to reduce the background\nphoton fluxes (BPFs) in the detecting direction as the main noise.

Contrary to possible physical arguments, favouring bends in the\npolymer does not return the model's behaviour to that comparable to the\nsemi-flexible homogeneous interaction model, where the canonical $\\theta$-point\noccurs for a range of parameter values. In fact, for sufficiently large bending\nenergies the crystal phase disappears altogether, and no phase transition of\nany type occurs.

Initially, each CuO2 layer was\nfound to expand the Fermi sphere owing to ridged geometry. When the two layers\nare close enough for tunneling, it becomes energetically advantageous to form\ncorrelated quantum states (CQS), reducing the Fermi sphere volume. Cooper\npairs, comprising inter-tunneling electrons, occupy the CQS. The image force is\nresponsible for the electron-electron attraction. Energy exchange between the\npaired electrons happens through photons. Pair-binding energy and the\ncorresponding effective mass vary in a wide range. At T>0, some heavy pairs do\nnot condense. Such pairs are responsible for pseudogap. Light pairs get Bose\ncondensed and are responsible for superconductivity. The proposed mechanism\nprovides possible explanation of two energy gaps and two characteristic\ntemperatures in cuprates. It also provides clarification on the unconventional\nisotopic effect, Fermi surface pockets, anisotropy of charge transport, and\nother properties of HTS cuprates. The pseudogap, calculated within the model,\nis close to the experimental values for the two-layer cuprates, such as YBCO,\nBi2212, Tl2212, and Hg1212.

This campaign was\npreparatory to the CoRoT satellite observations, which took place from October\n2007 to March 2008. Results: The frequency analysis clearly shows the presence\nof four frequencies in the 0.2-1.7 c/d interval, as well as six frequencies in\nthe 5-12 c/d domain. The low frequencies are typical for gamma Dor variables\nwhile the high frequencies are common for delta Sct pulsators. We propose the\nfrequency 2.666 c/d as a possible rotational frequency. All modes, for which an\nidentification was possible, seem to be high-degree modes (3 <= l <= 8). We did\nnot find evidence for a possible binary nature of HD49434. The element\nabundances we derived are consistent with the values obtained in previous\nanalyses.
