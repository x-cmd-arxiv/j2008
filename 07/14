Indeed, in the 60's Bell showed that the predictions of\nQM disagree with the results of any locally causal description. Accepting\nnon-local descriptions while retaining causality leads to a clash with the\ntheory of relativity. Furthermore, the causal arrow of time by definition\ncontradicts time-reversal symmetry. For these reasons, some authors (Feynman\nand Wheeler, Costa de Beauregard, Cramer, Price) have advocated abandoning\nmicroscopic causality. In the present article, a simplistic but concrete\nexample of following this line of thought is presented, in the form of a\nretro-causal toy-model which is stochastic and which provides an appealing\ndescription of the specific quantum correlations discussed by Bell.

The frequency\nof debris disks around A-type stars appears to increase from ~ 25% at 5 Myr to\n~ 50--60% at 20--25 Myr. Older A-type stars have smaller debris disk\nfrequencies: ~ 20% at 50--100 Myr.

To gain\nan actual evolution of precariously balanced objects subjected to various\nlevels of ground accelerations, a 3D investigation should be performed. In\nvirtue of some reasonable works from a number of mechanicians, we derive three\nresultant second-order ordinary differential equations determine the evolution\nof 3D responses. The new dynamic analysis is following the 3D rotation of a\nrigid body around a fixed point.

Each asset is characterised by\nthe cash flows it generates. Each cash flow is expressed as a function of one\nor more independent random variables called market factors or \"X-factors\". Each\nX-factor is associated with a \"market information process\", the values of which\nbecome available to market participants. In addition to true information about\nthe X-factor, the information process contains an independent \"noise\" term\nmodelled here by a Brownian bridge. The information process thus gives partial\ninformation about the X-factor, and the value of the market factor is only\nrevealed at the termination of the process. The market filtration is assumed to\nbe generated by the information processes associated with the X-factors. The\nprice of an asset is given by the risk-neutral expectation of the sum of the\ndiscounted cash flows, conditional on the information available from the\nfiltration. The theory is developed in some detail, with a variety of\napplications to credit risk management, share prices, interest rates, and\ninflation. A number of new exactly solvable models are obtained for the price\nprocesses of various types of assets and derivative securities; and a novel\nmechanism is proposed to account for the dynamics of stochastic volatility and\ndynamic correlation. A discrete-time version of the information-based framework\nis also developed, and is used to construct a new class of models for the real\nand nominal interest rate term structures, and the dynamics of the associated\nprice index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2008 10:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

The pairwise character of the\nelectronegativities in QTPIE avoids spurious charge transfer when bonds are\nbroken.

As\napplications, we show that edge ideals of graphs are splittable, and we provide\nan iterative method for computing the Betti numbers of the cover ideals of\nCohen-Macaulay bipartite graphs. Finally, we consider the frequency with which\none can find particular splittings of monomial ideals and raise questions about\nideals whose resolutions are characteristic-dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2008 15:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2009 22:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-14"}

After the\nestimate of the QCD evolution of the results from the momentum scale of the\nmodel to the experimental one, a reasonable agreement with the available data\nis obtained.
