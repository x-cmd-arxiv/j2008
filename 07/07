The second one, which is\nthe right one to choose in flat background, has been discarded with the\nargument that the Virasoro algebra closes only in the first case. To understand\nthis issue better with a completely covariant treatment we consider the easiest\ncase of bosonic strings propagating in an arbitrary pp-wave of the simplest\nkind. Using the phase-space method we show that MNO is in fact the right one to\nchoose because of the following reason. For both types of normal ordering the\nenergy-momentum tensor satisfies the desired Virasoro algebra up to anomalous\nterms proportional to the space-time equation of motion of the background.\nHowever, it is MNO which gives rise to the correct spectrum - we compute the\nquadratic space-time action by restricting the string field inside a transverse\nHilbert space.

In the LV we\nidentify voids with sizes ranging from 1 to 4.5Mpc and compare the\nobservational distribution of void sizes with the voids in very high resolution\nsimulations of the LCDM model with WMAP1 and WMAP3 parameters.

This paper expands upon previous work modeling the phase space\ndistributions of accelerated ions associated with the shock event encountered\non day 292 of 1991 by the Ulysses mission at 4.5 AU. A kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulation is employed here to model the diffusive acceleration process. This\nexposition presents recent developments pertaining to the incorporation into\nthe simulation of the diffusive characteristics incurred by field line\nwandering (FLW), according to the work of Giacalone and Jokipii. For a pure\nfield-line wandering construct, it is determined that the upstream spatial ramp\nscales are too short to accommodate the HI-SCALE flux increases for 200 keV\nprotons, and that the distribution function for H+ somewhat underpopulates the\ncombined SWICS/HI-SCALE spectra at the shock. This contrasts our earlier\ntheory/data comparison where it was demonstrated that diffusive transport in\nhighly turbulent fields according to kinetic theory can successfully account\nfor both the proton distributions and upstream ramp scales, using a single\nturbulence parameter. The principal conclusion here is that, in a FLW scenario,\nthe transport of ions across the mean magnetic field is slightly less efficient\nthan is required to effectively trap energetic ions within a few Larmor radii\nof the shock layer and thereby precipitate efficient acceleration. This\nhighlights the contrast between ion transport in highly turbulent shock\nenvirons and remote, less-disturbed interplanetary regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2008 01:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

We model the expected photon\nspectra for such \"proton-dominated\" GRBs in the internal shock scenario through\nMonte Carlo simulations, accounting for various processes related to\nhigh-energy electrons and protons. Besides proton and muon synchrotron\ncomponents, emission from photomeson-induced secondary pair cascades becomes\ncrucial, generally enhancing the GeV-TeV and/or eV-keV photons and offering a\nsignature of UHE protons. In some cases, it can overwhelm the primary electron\ncomponent and result in GRBs peaking in the 10 MeV - 1 GeV range, which may be\nrelevant to some bursts discussed in a recent re-analysis of EGRET TASC data.\nThe dependence of the spectra on key quantities such as the bulk Lorentz\nfactor, magnetic field and proton-to-electron ratio is nontrivial due to the\nnonlinear nature of cascading and the interplay of electron- and proton-induced\ncomponents.

The leading idea is that the physical properties of quantum systems\ncould be inferred merely considering the delocalization ranges of dynamical\nvariables, rather than their local values. In effect, despite the agnostic\ncharacter of the approach proposed, both papers show that the kind of physical\ninformation reachable reproduces exactly in all cases examined that obtained\nsolving the pertinent wave equations.

In this paper, we give an algorithmic description of these Cauchon\ndiagrams when the chosen reduced decomposition of $w_0$ corresponds to a good\nordering (in the sense of Lusztig \\cite{Lu2}) of the set of positive roots.\nThis algorithmic description is based on the constraints that are coming from\nLusztig's admissible planes \\cite{Lu2}: each admissible plane leads to a set of\nconstraints that a diagram has to satisfy to be Cauchon. Moreover, we\nexplicitely describe the set of Cauchon diagrams for explicit reduced\ndecomposition of $w_0$ in each possible type. In any case, we check that the\nnumber of Cauchon diagrams is always equal to the cardinal of $W$. In\n\\cite{CM}, we use these results to prove that Cauchon diagrams correspond\ncanonically to the positive subexpressions of $w_0$. So the results of this\npaper also give an algorithmic description of the positive subexpressions of\nany reduced decomposition of $w_0$ corresponding to a good ordering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2008 13:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 11:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-10"}

Our data cover three\ndifferent spectral states, namely Hard/Intermediate State, Soft/Intermediate\nState and High/Soft State. We investigate the spectral variability of the\nsource across the different spectral states. The hard X-ray spectrum becomes\nsofter during the HIMS-to-SIMS transition, but it hardens when reaching the HSS\nstate. A principal component analysis demonstrates that most of the variability\noccurs through two independent modes: a pivoting of the spectrum around 6 keV\n(responsible for 75% of the variance) and an intensity variation of the hard\ncomponent (responsible for 21%). The pivoting is interpreted as due to changes\nin the soft cooling photon flux entering the corona, the second mode as\nfluctuations of the heating rate in the corona. Our spectral analysis of the\nspectra of GX 339-4 shows a high energy excess with respect to pure thermal\nComptonisation models in the HIMS: a non-thermal power-law component seems to\nbe requested by data. In all spectral states joint IBIS, SPI and JEM-X data are\nwell represented by hybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonisation (EQPAIR). The\nspectral evolution seems to be predominantly driven by a reduction of the ratio\nof the electron heating rate to the soft cooling photon flux in the corona,\nl_h/l_s. The inferred accretion disc soft thermal emission increases by about\ntwo orders of magnitude, while the Comptonised luminosity decreases by at most\na factor of 3. This confirms that the softening we observed is due to a major\nincrease in the flux of soft cooling photons in the corona associated with a\nmodest reduction of the electron heating rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2008 13:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Such classification is based on the cloud morphology only\nand does not address the dynamical state of the object. In this paper we\ninvestigate the initial cloud collapse and subsequent disk formation through\nthe dynamical behavior as reflected in the sub-millimeter spectral emission\nline profiles. If a young stellar object is to be characterized by its\ndynamical structure it is important to know how accurately information about\nthe velocity field can be extracted and which observables provide the best\ndescription of the kinematics. Of particular interest is the transition from\ninfalling envelope to rotating disk, because this provides the initial\nconditions for the protoplanetary disk, such as mass and size. We use a\nhydrodynamical model, describing the collapse of a core and formation of a\ndisk, to produce synthetic observables which we compare to calculated line\nprofiles of a simple parameterized model.

Moreover, we conjecture that the density of the modes\n(DOM) is a dynamical variable which has the flexibility of varying with respect\nto the boundary conditions as well as the initial conditions; in fact, the e.m.\nfield generated by two monochromatic counter-propagating pump waves leads to\ninterference effects inside a quarter-wave (QW) symmetric 1D-PBG structure.\nFinally, here, for the first time, a large number of theoretical assumptions on\nQNM metrics for an open cavity, never discussed in literature, are proved, and\na simple and direct method to calculate the QNM norm for a 1D-PBG structure is\nreported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2008 15:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-04"}

Natural\ntime series frequently combine both effects, and linear fractional stable\nmotion (lfsm) is a model process of this type, combining alpha-stable jumps\nwith a memory kernel. In contrast complex physical spatiotemporal diffusion\nprocesses where both the above effects compete have for many years been\nmodelled using the fully fractional (FF) kinetic equation for the continuous\ntime random walk (CTRW), with power laws in the pdfs of both jump size and\nwaiting time. We derive the analogous kinetic equation for lfsm and show that\nit has a diffusion coefficient with a power law in time rather than having a\nfractional time derivative like the CTRW. We discuss some preliminary results\non the scaling of burst \"sizes\" and \"durations\" in lfsm time series, with\napplications to modelling existing observations in space physics and elsewhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2008 15:55:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 19:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}

Comparing the two-point\ncorrelation function of scalar operators in AdS and QCD, information about the\ncondensates can be derived. Strong couplings of scalar states to pairs of light\npseudoscalar mesons turn out to be small, at odds with experiment and QCD\nestimates: this discrepancy is related to the description of chiral symmetry\nbreaking in this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2008 15:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
