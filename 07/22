T-duality along four directions\nin Poincare parametrization of AdS5 maps the bosonic part of the superstring\naction into itself. On bosonic level, this duality may be understood as a\nsymmetry of the first-order (phase space) system of equations for the coset\ncomponents of the current. The associated Lax connection is invariant modulo\nthe action of an so(2,4)-automorphism. We then show that this symmetry extends\nto the full superstring, provided one supplements the transformation of the\nbosonic components of the current with a transformation on the fermionic ones.\nAt the level of the action, this symmetry can be seen by combining the bosonic\nduality transformation with a similar one applied to part of the fermionic\nsuperstring coordinates. As a result, the full superstring action is mapped\ninto itself, albeit in a different kappa-symmetry gauge. One implication is\nthat the dual model has the same superconformal symmetry group as the original\none, and this may be seen as a consequence of the integrability of the\nsuperstring. The invariance of the Lax connection under the duality implies a\nmap on the full set of conserved charges that should interchange some of the\nNoether (local) charges with hidden (non-local) ones and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2008 17:13:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2008 19:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-30"}

We investigate how the inclusion of thermal conduction changes\nthe physical parameters of the hot shocked wind gas and the amount of X-ray\nemission predicted by time-dependent hydrodynamical models of planetary nebulae\nwith central stars of normal, hydrogen-rich surface composition. The radiation\nhydrodynamical models show that heat conduction leads to lower temperatures and\nhigher densities within a bubble and brings the physical properties of the\nX-ray emitting domain into close agreement with the values derived from\nobservations. Depending on the central-star mass and the evolutionary phase,\nour models predict X-ray [0.45--2.5 keV] luminosities between $10^{-8}$ and\n$10^{-4}$ of the stellar bolometric luminosities, in good agreement with the\nobservations. Less than 1% of the wind power is radiated away in this X-ray\nband. Although temperature, density, and also the mass of the hot bubble is\nsignificantly altered by heat conduction, the dynamics of the whole system\nremains practically the same. Heat conduction allows the construction of\nnebular models which predict the correct amount of X-ray emission and at the\nsame time are fully consistent with the observed mass-loss rate and wind speed.\nThermal conduction must be considered as a viable physical process for\nexplaining the diffuse X-ray emission from planetary nebulae with closed inner\ncavities.

The accumulated contributions of\nsynonymous codons of an amino acid to the total folding energy of an mRNA is\nstrongly correlated to the relative amount of that amino acid in the translated\nprotein.\n  Conclusion: Synonymous codons are not interchangable with regard to their\nrole in determining the mRNA FE and the relative amounts of amino acids in the\ntranslated protein, even if they are indistinguishable in respect of amino acid\ncoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2008 16:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-22"}

We investigate the effect of the\nimpact of Type Ia supernova ejecta on a main sequence companion star of the\nprogenitor system.

We present N-band spectro-interferometric\nobservations of the silicate carbon star BM Gem using MIDI at the Very Large\nTelescope Interferometer (VLTI). Our aim is to probe the spatial distribution\nof oxygen-rich dust with high spatial resolution. BM Gem was observed with\nVLTI/MIDI at 44--62 m baselines using the UT2-UT3 and UT3-UT4 baseline\nconfigurations. The N-band visibilities observed for BM Gem show a steep\ndecrease from 8 to ~10 micron and a gradual increase longward of ~10 micron,\nreflecting the optically thin silicate emission feature emanating from\nsub-micron-sized amorphous silicate grains. The differential phases obtained at\nbaselines of ~44--46 m show significant non-zero values (~ -70 degrees) in the\ncentral part of the silicate emission feature between ~9 and 11 micron,\nrevealing a photocenter shift and the asymmetric nature of the silicate\nemitting region. The observed N-band visibilities and differential phases can\nbe fairly explained by a simple geometrical model in which the unresolved star\nis surrounded by a ring with azimuthal brightness modulation. The best-fit\nmodel is characterized by a broad ring (~70 mas across at 10 micron) with a\nbright region which is offset from the unresolved star by ~20 mas at a position\nangle of ~280 degrees.

Controlling the error on the\noverlap glueing region enables us to use a result of Joyce to conclude that the\nresulting compact smooth 7-manifold admits a torsion-free G_2 structure, with\nfull G_2 holonomy.\n  There are topological obstructions for this procedure to work, which arise\nfrom the degree 3 and degree 4 cohomology of the asymptotically conical G_2\nmanifolds which are glued in at each conical singularity.

The field started with the\nrealization that optically thick free space ensembles can be efficiently\ninterfaced with quantum optical fields. By now the atomic ensemble - light\ninterfaces have become a powerful alternative to the cavity-enhanced\ninteraction of light with single atoms. We discuss various mechanisms used for\nthe quantum interface, including quantum nondemolition or Faraday interaction,\nquantum measurement and feedback, Raman interaction and electromagnetically\ninduced transparency. The paper provides a common theoretical frame for these\nprocesses, describes basic experimental techniques and media used for quantum\ninterfaces, and reviews several key experiments on quantum memory for light,\nquantum entanglement between atomic ensembles and light, and quantum\nteleportation with atomic ensembles. We discuss the two types of quantum\nmeasurements which are most important for the interface: homodyne detection and\nphoton counting. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future of atomic\nensembles as an enabling technology in quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2008 21:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2008 14:37:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 May 2009 12:32:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2009 09:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 13:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-28"}

While photoemission matrix elements\nclearly play a role in changing the aesthetic appearance of the band\ndispersion, i.e. the 'waterfall'-like behavior, they provide an inadequate\ndescription for the physics that underlies the strong band renormalization\ngiving rise to the HEA.

Based on Fisher's articles and books it is justified that by\nestimation Fisher meant the construction of likelihood intervals or regions\nfrom appropriate likelihood function and that an estimate is a statistic, that\nis, a function from a sample space to a parameter space such that the\nlikelihood function obtained from the sampling distribution of the statistic at\nthe observed value of the statistic is used to construct likelihood intervals\nor regions. Thus Problem of Estimation is how to choose the 'best' estimate.\nFisher's solution for the problem of estimation is Maximum Likelihood Estimate\n(MLE). Fisher's Theory of Statistical Estimation is a chain of ideas used to\njustify MLE as the solution of the problem of estimation. The construction of\nconfidence intervals by the delta method from the asymptotic normal\ndistribution of MLE is based on Fisher's ideas, but is against his 'logic of\nstatistical inference'. Instead the construction of confidence intervals from\nthe profile likelihood function of a given interest function of the parameter\nvector is considered as a solution more in line with Fisher's 'ideology'. A new\nmethod of calculation of profile likelihood-based confidence intervals for\ngeneral smooth interest functions in general statistical models is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2008 06:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-23"}

This equation contains a\nfractional Gaussian noise term representing the branching of an avalanche into\nsmall active clusters, and a drift term reflecting the tendency for small\navalanches to grow and large avalanches to be constricted by the finite system\nsize. If one defines avalanching to take place when the toppling activity\nexceeds a certain threshold the stochastic model allows us to compute the\navalanche exponents in the continum limit as functions of the Hurst exponent of\nthe noise.

We\ninclude an overview of the theory of refractivity, and the influence of\ninfrared resonances caused by the presence of water vapour and other\nconstituents in the atmosphere. `Traditional' atmospheric dispersion is likely\nto cause a loss of Strehl only at the shortest wavelengths (L-band).

The model in\nits infinite-size limit exhibits shape-phase transitions between spherical,\ndeformed prolate, and deformed oblate forms of the ground state. Finite-size\nprecursors of such behavior are verified by robust variations of nuclear\nproperties (nuclear masses, excitation energies, transition probabilities for\nlow lying levels) across the chart of nuclides. Simultaneously, the model\nserves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of\nQPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from\nlattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of\nthe present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase\ntransitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT\nphenomena. (b) The competing quantum phases are characterized by specific\ndynamical symmetries and novel symmetry related approaches are developed to\ndescribe also the transitional dynamical domains. (c) In some parameter\nregions, the QPT-like behavior can be ascribed also to individual excited\nstates, which is linked to the thermodynamic and classical descriptions of the\nsystem. (d) The model and its phase structure can be extended in many\ndirections: by separating proton and neutron excitations, considering\nodd-fermion degrees of freedom or different particle-hole configurations, by\nincluding other types of bosons, higher order interactions, and by imposing\nexternal rotation. All these aspects of IBM phase transitions are relevant in\nthe interpretation of experimental data and important for a fundamental\nunderstanding of the QPT phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2008 12:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

For the Poisson case, the large-N limit of P(Q)\ncan be expressed as an integral with infinitely many poles, whose accumulation,\nrequiring regularization with the Lerch transcendent, generates the singularity\nat Q=1, while the large-Q decay is determined by the pole closest to the\norigin. Determining the large-N limit of P(Q) for the GUE seems difficult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2008 13:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-23"}

The model is based on an equation for the order\nparameter (wave function), which is derived from the energy density for the\nweakly coupled BCS superfluid. The equation includes a nonlinear self-repulsive\nterm of power 7/3, which accounts for the Fermi pressure. Reducing the equation\nto the 1D or 2D form, we construct families of stable 1D and 2D gap solitons\n(GSs) by means of numerical simulations, which are guided by the variational\napproximation (VA). The GSs are, chiefly, compact objects trapped in a single\ncell of the OL potential. In the linear limit, the VA predicts almost exact\npositions of narrow Bloch bands that separate the semi-infinite and first\nfinite gaps, as well as the first and second finite ones. Families of stable\neven and odd bound states of 1D GSs are constructed too. We also demonstrate\nthat the GS can be dragged without much distortion by an OL moving at a\nmoderate velocity ($\\sim $ 1 mm/s, in physical units). The predicted GSs\ncontain $\\sim 10^{3}-10^{4}$ and $\\sim 10^{3}$ atoms per 1D and 2D settings,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2008 14:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
