We\nfollow the evolution of a multi-mass system of BHs and stars by numerically\nintegrating the Fokker-Planck energy diffusion equations for a variety of BH\nmass distributions. We find that the BHs \"self-segregate'', and that the\nrarest, most massive BHs dominate the scattering rate closest to the SMBH (<\n0.1 pc). BH--BH binaries form out of gravitational wave emission during BH\nencounters. We find that the expected rate of BH coalescence events detectable\nby Advanced LIGO is ~1 - 100/yr, depending on the initial mass function of\nstars in galactic nuclei and the mass of the most massive BHs. We find that the\nactual merger rate is likely ~10 times larger than this due to the intrinsic\nscatter of stellar densities in many different galaxies. The BH binaries that\nform this way in galactic nuclei have significant eccentricities as they enter\nthe LIGO band (90% with e > 0.9), and are therefore distinguishable from other\nbinaries, which circularise before becoming detectable. We also show that\neccentric mergers can be detected to larger distances and greater BH masses\nthan circular mergers, up to ~ 700 solar masses. Future ground-based\ngravitational wave observatories will be able to constrain both the mass\nfunction of BHs and stars in galactic nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2008 19:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2009 17:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The tilted spin polarization of free electrons is induced under\ninterband absorption of circularly polarized light, and the paramagnetic\ncenters acquire spin polarization because of spin-dependent capture of free\nspin-polarized electrons by these centers. The measured Hanle curve is a\nsuperposition of two lines, narrow and broad, with the widths ~400 G and ~50000\nG, arising due to the depolarization of localized and free electrons,\nrespectively.

A localization phase transition is\nexpected to occur in three dimensional disordered systems as the strength of\ndisorder crosses a critical value. Recently, a crossover from an extended to a\nlocalized phase has been observed in low-dimensional photonic lattices and\nBose-Einstein condensates. Other experiments studied the critical behaviour\nnear the transition in three dimensions via transmission measurements. However,\nno direct observation of a localization transition for light has been reported.\nIn 1979 Aubry and Andre predicted that for a certain class of quasi-periodic\npotentials, a localization phase transition can occur already in one-dimension.\nThis strongly correlated potential is markedly different from the disordered\ncase were the potential is uncorrelated. Here we report an experiment that\nrealizes the Aubry-Andre model in quasi-periodic photonic lattices. We observe\nthe signature of a localization phase transition by directly measuring the\nexpansion rates of initially narrow wave packets propagating in the lattice.\nBelow the transition point, all the modes of the system are extended and\ntherefore an initially narrow wave-packet eventually spreads across the entire\nlattice. Above the critical point, all modes are localized and expansion is\nsuppressed. In addition, we study the effect of weak nonlinear interactions on\nlight propagation below and above the transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2008 18:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-09"}

The internal density\ndistribution of a planet has a direct effect on the star-planet orbit through\nthe gravitational quadrupole field created by the rotational and tidal bulges.\nThese quadrupoles induce apsidal precession that is proportional to the\nplanetary Love number ($k_{2p}$, twice the apsidal motion constant), a bulk\nphysical characteristic of the planet that depends on the internal density\ndistribution, including the presence or absence of a massive solid core. We\nfind that the quadrupole of the planetary tidal bulge is the dominant source of\napsidal precession for very hot Jupiters ($a \\lesssim 0.025$ AU), exceeding the\neffects of general relativity and the stellar quadrupole by more than an order\nof magnitude. For the shortest-period planets, the planetary interior induces\nprecession of a few degrees per year. By investigating the full photometric\nsignal of apsidal precession, we find that changes in transit shapes are much\nmore important than transit timing variations. With its long baseline of\nultra-precise photometry, the space-based \\emph{Kepler} mission can\nrealistically detect apsidal precession with the accuracy necessary to infer\nthe presence or absence of a massive core in very hot Jupiters with orbital\neccentricities as low as $e \\simeq 0.003$.

The electron density of the outflow regions derived from a density\nsensitive intensity ratio of Fe XII lines is rather low for an active region.\nMost regions average around 7E10+8 cm(-3), but there are variations on pixel\nspatial scales of about a factor of 4. We discuss results in detail for two\nactive regions observed by EIS. Images of active regions in line intensity,\nline width, and line centroid are obtained by rastering the regions. We also\ndiscuss data from the active regions obtained from other orbiting spacecraft\nthat support the conclusions obtained from analysis of the EIS spectra. The\nlocations of the flows in the active regions with respect to the longitudinal\nphotospheric magnetic fields suggest that these regions might be tracers of\nlong loops and/or open magnetic fields that extend into the heliosphere, and\nthus the flows could possibly contribute significantly to the solar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2008 19:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our approach combines advantages of observational constraints in halo\noccupation models and hydrodynamic merger simulations. This allows us to\nseparate the relative roles of dissipation, dry mergers, formation time, and\nprogenitor evolution, and identify their effects on scalings at each redshift.\nDissipation is the most important factor determining spheroid sizes and\nfundamental plane (FP) scalings, and can account for the FP tilt and\ndifferences between disk and spheroid scalings. Because disks at high-z have\nhigher gas fractions, mergers are more gas-rich, yielding more compact\nspheroids. This predicts mass-dependent evolution in spheroid sizes, in\nagreement with observations. This relates to subtle evolution in the FP,\nimportant to studies that assume a fixed intrinsic FP.

By employing a cavity to confine\nthe field, the strength of this interaction can be increased many orders of\nmagnitude to a point where it dominates over any dissipative process. This\nstrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics has been reached for\nreal atoms in optical cavities, and for artificial atoms in circuit QED and\nquantum-dot systems. A signature of strong coupling is the splitting of the\ncavity transmission peak into a pair of resolvable peaks when a single resonant\natom is placed inside the cavity - an effect known as vacuum Rabi splitting.\nThe circuit QED architecture is ideally suited for going beyond this linear\nresponse effect. Here, we show that increasing the drive power results in two\nunique nonlinear features in the transmitted heterodyne signal: the\nsupersplitting of each vacuum Rabi peak into a doublet, and the appearance of\nadditional peaks with the characteristic sqrt(n) spacing of the Jaynes-Cummings\nladder. These constitute direct evidence for the coupling between the quantized\nmicrowave field and the anharmonic spectrum of a superconducting qubit acting\nas an artificial atom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2008 21:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-02"}

To explore the\nreversibility we reverse the quantum evolution at some moment $T$ immediately\nafter applying at this moment an instant perturbation governed by a strength\nparameter $\\xi$.

It was described that the\nmetal-insulator transition (MIT) at x = 0.5 observed in this system appears due\nto the enhancement of on-site Coulomb repulsion strength, U with Ti\nsubstitutions, x. The MIT primarily depends on U and partially on x and/or\ndisorder. All these conclusions are in sharp contrast to the experimental\nobservations, which predicted Anderson insulating phase at x = 0.5 (finite\nlocalized density of states at the Fermi level). The hard gap due to electron\ncorrelation appears at much higher x (~ 0.8). In addition, it is well\nestablished that homovalent substitution has negligible influence on on-site\n$U$ (a local variable). These inconsistencies appear due to the fact that the\ncalculated results representing the bulk electronic structure are compared with\nthe experimental results dominated by surface contributions. The experimental\nbulk spectra, already available in the literature exhibit finite density of\nstates at the Fermi level even for x >= 0.5 sample, which suggests that the\nconclusion of half metallic phase in an earlier study is reasonable.

The line ratio of CO J=2-1/1-0 is found to vary strongly from about\n0.7 near the galaxy center to 0.4 in the outer part of the galaxy. Excitation\nanalysis suggests that the gas density is low, less than 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$, over\nthe entire galaxy. By fitting the SED of ARP 302N in the far infrared we obtain\na dust temperature of $T\\rm_d$=26-36 K and a dust mass of M$\\rm\n_{dust}$=2.0--3.6$\\times10^8$ M$\\rm_\\odot$. The spectral index of the radio\ncontinuum is around 0.9. The spatial distribution and spectral index of the\nradio continuum emission suggests that most of the radio continuum emission is\nsynchrotron emission from the star forming regions at the nucleus and\nARP302N-cm. The good spatial correspondance between the 3.6 cm radio continuum\nemission, the Spitzer 8 & 24 $\\mu$m data and the high resolution CO J=2-1\nobservation from the SMA shows that there is the asymmetrical star forming\nactivities in ARP 302N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2008 09:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The code computes self-consistently the\nextinction of radiation in a dusty medium (including absorption and scattering)\nand the dust emission. METHODS: A binary-tree adaptive grid is used for the\ndescription of the dust distribution. Dust radiation is computed at thermal\nequilibrium or under stochastic heating condition, for a distribution of grains\nof different radii and materials. The code is applied to the case of a clumpy\ngalactic disk, including both diffuse dust and a distribution of spherical\nclouds modelled on the GMCs of local galaxies. Diffuse and localised sources of\nstarlight are used, with independent spectra. RESULTS: A model is provided for\nthe edge-on galaxy NGC 891. The SED of the galaxy from the UV to the submm/mm\nrange can be well reproduced by: a bulge/disk configuration of old stars\ntogether with an extended dust disk, as suggested by the analysis of\noptical/near-infrared images; a clumpy dust distribution of the same mass as\nthe diffuse dust disk, together with a UV emitting component, half of which in\nthe form of a diffuse disk and half in sources embedded in clouds. In total, it\nis found that about 35% of the bolometric radiation is absorbed (and emitted)\nby dust; and that absorption of starlight from the old population contributes\nto about 60% of the dust emission. A significant component of the dust emission\nfrom clouds is due to absorption of diffuse radiation. Radial profiles of dust\nemission in a clumpy disk are almost independent of the wavelength, with the\nexception of the wavelength range on the Wien side of the thermal equilibrium\npeak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2008 11:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2008 16:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The outburst of XMMU J004215.8+411924 lasted for\nabout one month. The source had a hard power-law spectrum with a photon index\nof 1.6.

DescribeX supports the construction of\nheterogeneous summaries where different document elements sharing a common\nstructure can be declaratively defined and refined by means of path regular\nexpressions on axes, or axis path regular expression (AxPREs). DescribeX can\nsignificantly help in the understanding of both the structure of complex,\nheterogeneous XML collections and the behaviour of XPath queries evaluated on\nthem.\n  Experimental results demonstrate the scalability of DescribeX summary\nrefinements and stabilizations (the key enablers for tailoring summaries) with\nmulti-gigabyte web collections.

Probability\ndistributions can be seen as particular (formal power) tree series [Berstel et\nal 82, Esik et al 03], i.e. mappings from trees to a semiring K . A widely\nstudied class of tree series is the class of rational (or recognizable) tree\nseries which can be defined either in an algebraic way or by means of\nmultiplicity tree automata. We argue that the algebraic representation is very\nconvenient to model probability distributions over a free algebra of trees.\nFirst, as in the string case, the algebraic representation allows to design\nlearning algorithms for the whole class of probability distributions defined by\nrational tree series. Note that learning algorithms for rational tree series\ncorrespond to learning algorithms for weighted tree automata where both the\nstructure and the weights are learned. Second, the algebraic representation can\nbe easily extended to deal with unranked trees (like XML trees where a symbol\nmay have an unbounded number of children). Both properties are particularly\nrelevant for applications: nondeterministic automata are required for the\ninference problem to be relevant (recall that Hidden Markov Models are\nequivalent to nondeterministic string automata); nowadays applications for Web\nInformation Extraction, Web Services and document processing consider unranked\ntrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2008 14:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-21"}
