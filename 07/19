Our method combines cosmological\nsimulations of galaxy-sized CDM halos to derive the properties of substructure\npopulations and controlled numerical experiments of consecutive subhalo impacts\nonto initially-thin, fully-formed disk galaxies. We demonstrate that close\nencounters between massive subhalos and galactic disks since z~1 should be\ncommon occurrences in LCDM models. In contrast, extremely few satellites in\npresent-day CDM halos are likely to have a significant impact on the disk\nstructure. One typical host halo merger history is used to seed controlled\nN-body experiments of subhalo-disk encounters. As a result of these accretion\nevents, the disk thickens considerably at all radii with the disk scale height\nincreasing in excess of a factor of 2 in the solar neighborhood. We show that\ninteractions with the subhalo population produce a wealth of distinctive\nmorphological signatures in the disk stars including: conspicuous flares; bars;\nlow-lived, ring-like features in the outskirts; and low-density, filamentary\nstructures above the disk plane. We compare a resulting dynamically-cold,\nring-like feature in our simulations to the Monoceros ring stellar structure in\nthe MW. The comparison shows quantitative agreement in both spatial\ndistribution and kinematics, suggesting that such observed complex stellar\ncomponents may arise naturally as disk stars are excited by encounters with\nsubhalos. These findings highlight the significant role of CDM substructure in\nsetting the structure of disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2008 16:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Relationships between flare properties, protoplanetary disks and\naccretion are examined in detail to test models of star-disk interactions at\nthe inner edge of the accretion disks. Previous studies had found no\ndifferences in flaring between diskfree and accreting systems other than a\nsmall overall diminution of X-ray luminosity in accreting systems. The most\nimportant finding is that X-ray coronal extents in fast-rotating diskfree stars\ncan significantly exceed the Keplerian corotation radius, whereas X-ray loop\nsizes in disky and accreting systems do not exceed the corotation radius. This\nis consistent with models of star-disk magnetic interaction where the inner\ndisk truncates and confines the PMS stellar magnetosphere. We also find two\ndifferences between flares in accreting and diskfree PMS stars. First, a\nsubclass of super-hot flares with peak plasma temperatures exceeding 100 MK are\npreferentially present in accreting systems. Second, we tentatively find that\naccreting stars produce flares with shorter durations.

Yet, no\nstars have ever been positively identified in this key phase in the life of a\nlow-mass star (hereafter the \"pre-ZAHB\" phase). We investigate the possibility\nthat some pre-ZAHB stars may cross the instability strip (IS), thus becoming\nvariable. In particular, it has been suggested that some RR Lyrae stars (RRL)\nwith high period change rates (P-dot) may in fact be pre-ZAHB stars. We present\nthe first theoretical effort devoted to interpreting some of the high-P-dot\nstars as pre-ZAHB pulsators. We constructed a grid of evolutionary tracks using\nthe Garching Stellar Evolution Code for a chemical composition appropriate to\nthe case of the globular cluster M3, where a number of stars with high P-dot\nvalues are found. We follow each star's pre-ZAHB evolution in detail, compute\nperiods and P-dot values for the stars lying inside the IS, and produce\npre-ZAHB Monte Carlo simulations for the case of M3. Our results indicate that\none should expect of order 1 pre-ZAHB star for every 60 or so bona-fide HB\nstars in M3. Among the pre-ZAHB stars, ~22% are expected to fall within the IS\nboundaries, presenting RRL-like pulsations. On average, the pre-ZAHB pulsators\nare expected to have longer periods than the bona-fide HB pulsators, and 76% of\nthem are predicted to show negative P-dot values. The most likely P-dot value\nfor the pre-ZAHB variables is ~-0.3 d/Myr, but more extreme P-dot values are\nalso possible: 38% of the variables are predicted to have P-dot < -0.8 d/Myr.\nIt appears likely, therefore, that some RRL stars in M3 with high (absolute)\nP-dot values are pre-ZAHB pulsators in disguise.

In this situation,\nthe standard method used to determine the behavior of cosmological\nperturbations breaks down. We present a generic method, based on the uniform\napproximation, to analytically derive the power spectra of scalar and tensor\nperturbations. For this purpose, a simple hierarchy of parameters, related to\nthe sound speed of the cosmological fluctuations and its successive\nderivatives, is introduced in a k-inflation analogue of the Hubble flow\nfunctions. The scalar spectral index and its running are obtained up to next to\nnext to leading order for all k-inflationary models. This result relies on the\nexistence of a well-motivated initial state, which is not trivial in the\npresent context: having the wavelength of the Fourier mode smaller than the\nsonic horizon is indeed not enough and some conditions on the dynamics of the\nsound speed are also required. Our method is then applied to various models\nencountered in the literature. After deriving a generic slow-roll trajectory\nvalid for any DBI model, simple formulae for the cosmological observables are\nobtained. In particular, the running, as the spectral index, for the so-called\nUV and IR brane inflationary models is found to be uniquely determined by the\n't Hooft coupling. Finally, the accuracy of these cosmological predictions is\nassessed by comparing the analytical approximations with exact numerical\nintegrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2008 19:36:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2009 15:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-07"}

From a previous\nstudy of edge-on galaxies, this nuclear star cluster was found to be one of a\nsample of clusters that appear flattened along the plane of their host galaxies\ndisks. Such clusters show evidence for multiple morphological components, with\nyounger/bluer disk components and older/redder spheroidal components. Our new\nobservations of NGC 4244 show clear rotation of 30 km/sec within the central 10\npc (0.5\") of the cluster. The central velocity dispersion is found to be 28+/-2\nkm/sec. The multiple stellar populations inferred from the optical colors and\nspectra are seen as variations in the CO line strength in the NIFS spectra. The\nrotation is clearly detected even in the older, more spheroidal stellar\ncomponent. We discuss evidence for similar structures and kinematics in the\nnuclear star clusters of other galaxies including M33 and the Milky Way. Our\nobservations support two possible formation mechanisms: (1) episodic accretion\nof gas from the disk directly onto the nuclear star cluster, or (2) episodic\naccretion of young star clusters formed in the central part of the galaxy due\nto dynamical friction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2008 20:13:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2008 21:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We work with an apparent-diameter limited\nparent sample of 248 galaxies from the HST Groth Strip Survey. We apply a\nconservative criterion to identify bulges and potential precursors of\npresent-day bulges based on nuclear surface brightness excess above the\nexponential profile of the outer parts. We measure bulge colours on wedge\nprofiles opening on the semi-minor axis, and compare them to disk, and global\ngalaxy colours. For 60% of galaxies with bulges, the rest-frame nuclear colour\ndistribution shows a red sequence that is well fit by passive evolution models\nof various ages, while the remainder 40% scatters towards bluer colours. In\ncontrast, galaxies without central brightness excess show typical colours of\nstar forming population and lack a red sequence. We also see that, as in the\nlocal Universe, most of the minor axis colour profiles are negative (bluer\noutward), and fairly gentle, indicating that nuclear colours are not distinctly\ndifferent from disk colours. This is corroborated when comparing nuclear,\nglobal and disk colours: these show strong correlations, for any value of the\ncentral brightness prominence of the bulge. Comparison with synthetic models of\nred sequence bulge colours suggests that such red bulges have stopped forming\nstars at an epoch earlier than ~ 1 Gyr before the observation. The correlation\nbetween nuclear and disk colours and the small colour gradients hints at an\nintertwined star formation history for bulges and disks: probably, most of our\nred bulges formed in a process in which truncation of star formation in the\nbulge did not destroy the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2008 21:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We\nanalyze the evolution of the physical quantities, relevant for the physical\ndescription of the early universe, namely, the energy density, temperature and\nscale factor, before, during, and after the phase transition. To study the\ncosmological dynamics and evolution we use both analytical and numerical\nmethods. In particular, due to the high energy density in the early Universe,\nwe consider in detail the specific brane world model case of neglecting the\nterms linearly proportional to the energy density with respect to the quadratic\nterms. A small brane tension and a high value of the dark radiation term tend\nto decrease the effective temperature of the quark-gluon plasma and of the\nhadronic fluid, respectively, and to significantly accelerate the transition to\na pure hadronic phase. By assuming that the phase transition may be described\nby an effective nucleation theory, we also consider the case where the Universe\nevolved through a mixed phase with a small initial supercooling and\nmonotonically growing hadronic bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jul 2008 05:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

However aliasing\ncorrupts the edge channels so they usually have to be excluded from the data\nset. In systems with around 10 channels, the loss in sensitivity can be\nsignificant. In addition, the low level of residual aliasing in the remaining\nchannels may cause systematic errors. Moreover, delay errors have been widely\nreported in implementations of broadband analogue correlators and simulations\nhave shown that delay errors exasperate the effects of aliasing. Aims: We\ndescribe a software-based approach that suppresses aliasing by oversampling the\ncross-correlation function. This method can be applied to interferometers with\nindividually-tracking antennas equipped with a discrete path compensator\nsystem. It is based on the well-known property of interferometers where the\ndrift scan response is the Fourier transform of the source's band-limited\nspectrum. Methods: In this paper, we simulate a single baseline interferometer,\nboth for a real and a complex correlator. Fringe-rotation usually compensates\nfor the phase of the fringes to bring the phase centre in line with the\ntracking centre. Instead, a modified fringe-rotation is applied. This enables\nan oversampled cross-correlation function to be reconstructed by gathering\nsuccessive time samples. Results: Simulations show that the oversampling method\ncan synthesise the cross-power spectrum while avoiding aliasing and works\nrobustly in the presence of noise. An important side benefit is that it\nnaturally accounts for delay errors in the correlator and the resulting\nspectral channels are regularly gridded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jul 2008 10:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

From the Jacobi three terms recursive relation for the\ndenominators of the Pad\\'e Approximations built on the well-known Z-transform\nof an infinite time-series, we build an Hilbert space operator, a J-Operator,\nwhere each bound state (inside the unit circle in the complex plane) is simply\nassociated to one damped oscillator while the continuous spectrum of the\nJ-Operator, which lies on the unit circle itself, is shown to represent the\nnoise. Signal and noise are thus clearly separated in the complex plane. For a\nfinite time series of length 2N, the J-operator is replaced by a finite order\nJ-Matrix J_N, having N eigenvalues which are time reversal covariant. Different\nclasses of input noise, such as blank (white and uniform), Gaussian and pink,\nare discussed in detail, the J-Matrix formalism allowing us to efficiently\ncalculate hundreds of poles of the Z-transform. Evidence of a universal\nbehaviour in the final statistical distribution of the associated poles and\nzeros of the Z-transform is shown. In particular the poles and zeros tend, when\nthe length of the time series goes to infinity, to a uniform angular\ndistribution on the unit circle. Therefore at finite order, the roots of unity\nin the complex plane appear to be noise attractors. We show that the\nZ-transform presents the exceptional feature of allowing lossless undersampling\nand how to make use of this property. A few basic examples are given to suggest\nthe power of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jul 2008 14:58:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2009 01:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
