While Fourier methods like ours are expected\nto work best when applied to smooth, large-scale asymmetric beam systematics\n(such as far-side lobe effects) we show that our m-truncated spherical harmonic\nrepresentation of the beam results in negligible reconstruction error -- even\nfor m as small as 4 for a polarized elliptically asymmetric beam. We describe a\nhybrid OpenMP/MPI parallelization scheme which allows us to store and\nmanipulate the time-ordered data from instruments with arbitrary scanning\nstrategy.

I show that this expectation is realized for periods\nsmall compared to the duration of the experiment P/T << 1, but not when P/T >~\n1. At longer periods, the fact that models of astrometric observations must\ntake account of an extra nuisance parameter causes the mass error to begin\ndeteriorating at P/T ~ 0.8, as compared to P/T ~ 1.0 for RV. Moreover, the\ndeterioration is much less graceful. This qualitative difference carries over\nto the more complicated case in which the planet is being monitored in the\npresence of a distant companion that generates an approximately uniform\nacceleration. The period errors begin deteriorating somewhat earlier in all\ncases, but the situation is qualitatively similar to that of the mass errors.\nThese results imply that to preserve astrometric discovery space at the longest\naccessible orbits (which nominally have the lowest-mass sensitivity) requires\nsupplementary observations to identify or rule out distant companions that\ncould contribute quasi-uniform acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jul 2008 20:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-29"}

A practical approach to this inherently multiscale\nproblem is to model the system as a fictitious overdamped Brownian particle\nthat diffuses along the RC in the presence of an effective potential of mean\nforce (PMF) due to the rest of the system. By employing the recently proposed\nFR method [I. Kosztin et al., J. of Chem. Phys. 124, 064106 (2006)], which\nrequires only a small number of fast nonequilibrium MD simulations of the\nsystem in both forward and time reversed directions along the RC, we\nreconstruct the PMF: (1) of deca-alanine as a function of its end-to-end\ndistance, and (2) that guides the motion of potassium ions through the\ngramicidin A channel. In both cases the computed PMFs are found to be in good\nagreement with previous results obtained by different methods. Our approach\nappears to be about one order of magnitude faster than the other PMF\ncalculation methods and, in addition, it also provides the position dependent\ndiffusion coefficient along the RC. Thus, the obtained PMF and diffusion\ncoefficient can be used in a suitable stochastic model to estimate important\ncharacteristics of the studied systems, e.g., the mean folding time of the\nstretched deca-alanine and the mean diffusion time of the potassium ion through\ngramicidin A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2008 05:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Due to the flux limited nature of these surveys, the\nluminosity of the detected objects increases with distance. However, the [CII]\nluminosity does not climb as steeply as that of the far-infrared, giving the\ndecline in the L_[CII]/L_FIR ratio with L_FIR. Investigating this further, we\nfind that the [CII] luminosity exhibits similar drops as measured against the\ncarbon monoxide and radio continuum luminosities. The former may indicate that\nat higher luminosities a larger fraction of the carbon is locked up in the form\nof molecules and/or that the CO line radiation also contributes to the cooling,\ndone mainly by the [CII] line at low luminosities. The latter hints at\nincreased activity in these galaxies at greater distances, so we suggest that,\nin addition to an underlying heating of the dust by a stellar population, there\nis also heating of the embedded dusty torus by the ultra-violet emission from\nthe active nucleus, resulting in an excess in the far-infrared emission from\nthe more luminous objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2008 06:41:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2008 00:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 04:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 06:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the present one, we introduce an arithmetic\nanalogue of the Atiyah extension that defines an element -- the arithmetic\nAtiyah class -- in a suitable arithmetic extension group. If $\\overline{E}$ is\na hermitian vector bundle on an arithmetic scheme $X$, its arithmetic Atiyah\nclass is an obstruction to the algebraicity of the unitary connection on the\nvector bundle $E_\\C$ over the complex manifold $X(\\C)$ that is compatible with\nits holomorphic structure.\n  We develop basic properties of the arithmetic Atiyah class and study its\nvanishing in the case of hermitian line bundles. This may be translated into a\nconcrete problem of diophantine geometry, concerning rational points of the\nuniversal vector extension of the Picard variety of $X$. We investigate this\nproblem, which was already considered and solved in some cases by Bertrand, by\nusing a classical transcendence result of Schneider-Lang, and we derive a\nfiniteness result.\n  We also consider a geometric analog of our arithmetic situation, namely a\nsmooth, projective variety $X$ which is fibered on a curve $C$ defined over\nsome field $k$ of characteristic zero. To any line bundle $L$ over $X$ is\nattached its relative Atiyah class ${\\rm at}_{X/C}L$. We describe precisely\nwhen this class vanishes. In particular, when the fixed part of the relative\nPicard variety of $X$ over $C$ is trivial, this holds only when the restriction\nof $L$ to the generic fiber $X_K$ of $X$ over $C$ is a torsion line bundle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2008 08:42:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 14:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-15"}

Two postulates need to be\nsatisfied by any fair operational framework: NSF: \"no-signaling from the\nfuture\"--for the possibility of making predictions on the basis of past tests;\nPFAITH: \"existence of a preparationally faithful state\"--for the possibility of\npreparing any state and calibrating any test.

Postulate PFAITH then implies the\n\"local observability principle\", the tensor-product structure for the linear\nspaces of states and effects, the impossibility of bit commitment and\nadditional features, such an operational definition of transpose, a scalar\nproduct for effects, weak-selfduality of the theory, and more.

We found purely empirically that there is a limit of\nlogW/nu = -4.75 (W: equivalent width, nu: wavenumber) above which the observed\nlines do not follow the line formation theory based on the classical\nmicro-turbulent model and that the abundance analysis can be done only with the\nlines of logW/nu < -4.75. The C, O, and their isotopic abundances determined\nfrom such weak lines of CO and OH in 23 K - M giants are roughly consistent\nwith the predictions of evolutionary models. However, the stronger lines of\nlogW/nu > -4.75 cannot be analyzed at all by the classical line formation\ntheory. From the behavior of these lines and considering other observations\nsuch as the detections of H2O lines, not only in the late M giants but also in\nthe early M and K giants, we found that these lines are badly disturbed by the\ncontamination from extra molecular layers. We already know that the very strong\nlines of logW/nu > -4.4 are contaminated by the contribution from the extra\nwarm molecular layers, but we now show that such contamination should be\nprevailing not only in the strong low excitation lines but also in the\nintermediate-strength lines (-4.75 < logW/nu > -4.4) as well. The reason why\nthese lines cannot be used for determining photospheric abundances is simply\nbecause they include the contamination of the non-photospheric origin. Instead\nthey can be new proves of the warm molecular envelope for which little is known\nyet. An important conclusion is that the infrared spectra of K - M giants are a\nhybrid of at least two components originating in the photosphere and the warm\nmolecular envelope.

However, the formation of fully developed\nturbulence has often been prevented by the artificial viscosity inherent in\nhydrodynamical simulations, and a uniform post-shock flow has been assumed in\nall previous single-cloud studies. In reality, the flow behind the shock is\nalso likely to be turbulent, with non-uniform density, pressure and velocity\nstructure created as the shock sweeps over inhomogenities upstream of the\ncloud. To address these twin issues we use a sub-grid compressible k-epsilon\nturbulence model to estimate the properties of the turbulence generated in\nshock-cloud interactions and the resulting increase in the transport\ncoefficients that the turbulence brings. A detailed comparison with the output\nfrom an inviscid hydrodynamical code puts these new results into context.\n  We find that cloud destruction in inviscid and k-epsilon models occurs at\nroughly the same speed when the post-shock flow is smooth and when the density\ncontrast between the cloud and inter-cloud medium is less than 100. However,\nthere are increasing and significant differences as this contrast increases.\nClouds subjected to strong ``buffeting'' by a highly turbulent post-shock\nenvironment are destroyed significantly quicker. Additional calculations with\nan inviscid code where the post-shock flow is given random, grid-scale, motions\nconfirms the more rapid destruction of the cloud.\n  Our results clearly show that turbulence plays an important role in\nshock-cloud interactions, and that environmental turbulence adds a new\ndimension to the parameter space which has hitherto been studied (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2008 11:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The paradigm\nthat the nuclei of inactive galaxies are also occupied by black holes was\npredicted long ago by theory. In the last decade, this conjecture was confirmed\nby the discovery of giant-amplitude, non-recurrent X-ray flares from such\ninactive galaxies and explained in terms of outburst radiation from stars\ntidally disrupted by a dormant supermassive black hole at the nuclei of those\ngalaxies. Due to the scarcity of detected tidal disruption events, the\nconfirmation and follow-up of each new candidate is needed to strengthen the\ntheory through observational data, as well as to shed new light on the\ncharacteristics of this type of events. Two tidal disruption candidates have\nbeen detected with XMM-Newton during slew observations.

At present, optical spectra of the sources do not\npresent any evident signature of the disruption event.

It is shown that the mechanism, in which the\nleft-handed doublet of third generation quarks results from a mixing on the UV\nboundary of introduced fields Q_1L and Q_2L, is necessary for phenomenological\nreasons. Within the obtained models, both the global fit of R_b with A^b_FB [at\nthe various center of mass energies] and the fit of last precision electroweak\ndata in the light fermion sector can simultaneously be improved significantly\nwith respect to the pure Standard Model case, for M_KK = 3,4,5 TeV (first KK\ngauge boson) and a best-fit Higgs mass m_h > 115 GeV i.e. compatible with the\nLEP2 direct limit. The quantitative analysis of the oblique parameters S,T,U\neven shows that heavy Higgs mass values up to ~500 GeV may still give rise to\nan acceptable quality of the electroweak data fit, in contrast with the\nStandard Model. The set of obtained constraints on the parameter space, derived\npartly from precision electroweak data, is complementary of a future direct\nexploration of this parameter space at the LHC. In particular, we find that\ncustodians, like b' modes, can be as light as ~1200 GeV i.e. a mass lying\npossibly in the potential reach of LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2008 14:29:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2008 00:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-12"}

Several of these regularities will be discussed.\nIt will be shown that in all of the three limiting symmetries of the IBA [U(5),\nSU(3), and O(6)], energies of 0+ states grow linearly with their ordinal\nnumber. Furthermore, it will be proved that the narrow transition region\nseparating the symmetry triangle of the IBA into a spherical and a deformed\nregion is described quite well by the degeneracies E(0_2^+)=E(6_1^+), E(0_3^+)\n=E(10_1^+), E(0_4^+)=E(14_1^+), the energy ratio E(6_1^+) /E(0_2^+) turning out\nto be a simple, empirical, easy-to-measure effective order parameter,\ndistinguishing between first- and second-order transitions.

This implies a novel two-phase quantum hydrodynamic model whose\nLagrangian picture provides an exact scheme to calculate the time-dependent\nwavefunction from a continuum of deterministic trajectories where two points\nare linked by at most two orbits. Properties of the model are examined,\nincluding the appearance of entangled trajectories in separable states.\nWavefunction constructions employing alternative two-phase models are proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2008 15:53:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2008 19:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}
