If\nwe did not live close to the centre of the void, we would have observed a\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole much larger than that allowed by\nobservations. Hence, until now it has been argued, for the model to be\nconsistent with observations, that by coincidence we happen to live very close\nto the centre of the void or we are moving towards it. However, even if we are\nat the centre of the void, we can observe distant galaxy clusters, which are\noff-centre. In their frame of reference there should be a large CMB dipole,\nwhich manifests itself observationally for us as a kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich\n(kSZ) effect. kSZ observations give far stronger constraints on the LTB model\ncompared to other observational probes such as Type Ia Supernovae, the CMB, and\nbaryon acoustic oscillations. We show that current observations of only 9\nclusters with large error bars already rule out LTB models with void sizes\ngreater than approximately 1.5 Gpc and a significant underdensity, and that\nnear future kSZ surveys like the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, South Pole\nTelescope, APEX telescope, or the Planck satellite will be able to strongly\nrule out or confirm LTB models with giga parsec sized voids. On the other hand,\nif the LTB model is confirmed by observations, a kSZ survey gives a unique\npossibility of directly reconstructing the expansion rate and underdensity\nprofile of the void.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2008 18:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We investigate the evolution of linear metric\nfluctuations around this background, and calculate the amplification of the\nlong-wavelength GW of a certain polarization during the anisotropic expansion\n(this effect is absent for another GW polarization, and for scalar\nfluctuations). These GW are superimposed to the usual tensor modes of quantum\norigin from inflation, and are potentially observable if the total number of\ninflationary e-folds exceeds the minimum required to homogenize the observable\nuniverse only by a small margin. Their contribution to the temperature\nanisotropy angular power spectrum decreases with the multipole l as l^(-p),\nwhere p depends on the slope of the initial GW power-spectrum.

For the random graph G_{n,p}, for p> c log{n}/n, two\nspanning trees give an expander. This is suggested by the case of the complete\ngraph, where we prove that two random spanning trees give an expander. The\nconstruction of the splicer is elementary -- each spanning tree can be produced\nindependently using an algorithm by Aldous and Broder: a random walk in the\ngraph with edges leading to previously unvisited vertices included in the tree.\n  A second important application of splicers is to graph sparsification where\nthe goal is to approximate every cut (and more generally the quadratic form of\nthe Laplacian) using only a small subgraph of the original graph.\nBenczur-Karger as well as Spielman-Srivastava have shown sparsifiers with O(n\nlog n/eps^2)$ edges that achieve approximation within factors 1+eps and 1-eps.\nTheir methods, based on independent sampling of edges, need Omega(n log n)\nedges to get any approximation (else the subgraph could be disconnected) and\nleave open the question of linear-size sparsifiers.

For pure wino dark matter relevant to the LHC, PAMELA and GLAST\nshould report signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2008 19:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2008 18:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-16"}

The\nsource had recently emerged from outburst and was associated with a\nrelatively-faint counterpart with mag V~17. The optical (VLT/ULTRACAM) and\nX-ray (RXTE/PCA) data show a clear positive cross-correlation function (CCF)\nsignal, with the optical peak lagging X-rays by ~ 150 ms, preceded by a shallow\nrise and followed by a steep decline along with broad anti-correlation dips.\nExamination of the light curves shows that the main CCF features are reproduced\nin superpositions of flares and dips. The CCF peak is narrow and the X-ray\nauto-correlation function (ACF) is broader than the optical ACF, arguing\nagainst reprocessing as the origin for the rapid optical emission. X-ray\nflaring is associated with spectral hardening, but no corresponding changes are\ndetected around optical peaks and dips. The variability may be explained in the\ncontext of synchrotron emission with interaction between a jet and a corona.\nThe complex CCF structure in GX 339-4 has similarities to that of another\nremarkable X-ray binary XTE J1118+480, in spite of showing a weaker maximum\nstrength. Such simultaneous multi-wavelength, rapid timing studies provide key\nconstraints for modeling the inner regions of accreting stellar sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2008 20:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In a classical treatment the interaction\ncannot be turned on or off adiabatically as energy conservation cannot be\nmaintained in a physically meaningful way. In a fully second quantized theory\nthe interaction (or source) term is always present in the equation of motion\neven if the system is in the vacuum state.

Hence, the\ntransformation V(t) from free fields to interacting fields cannot be\ninterpreted as an actual time evolution. This makes the unitarity of V(t)quite\nunnecessary as the original reason for unitarity was to conserve probability\n(or energy) through a time evolution.

The clusters\nare located in the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) Dark Field, an\nextremely deep mid-infrared survey near the north ecliptic pole with photometry\nin 18 total bands from X-ray through far-IR. Two of the candidate clusters are\nadditionally detected as extended emission in matching Chandra data in the\nsurvey area allowing us to measure their masses to be M_{500}= 6.2 \\pm 1.0\n\\times 10^{13} and 3.6 \\pm 1.1 \\times 10^{13} solar masses. For all three\nclusters we create a composite color magnitude diagram in rest-frame B-K using\nour deep HST and Spitzer imaging. By comparing the fraction of low luminosity\nmember galaxies on the composite red sequence with the corresponding population\nin local clusters at z=0.1 taken from the COSMOS survey, we examine the effect\nof a galaxy's mass on its evolution. We find a deficit of faint galaxies on the\nred sequence in our z~1 clusters which implies that more massive galaxies have\nevolved in clusters faster than less massive galaxies, and that the less\nmassive galaxies are still forming stars in clusters such that they have not\nyet settled onto the red sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2008 00:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is found that the nonequilibrium distributions are\ndetermined by an interplay between weak energy relaxation on acoustic phonons\nand generation-recombination processes as well as by the effect of pumping\nsaturation.

The result (maybe, a bit surprising) is:\none cannot characterize the functions in $\\ell_p(\\Z)$ or $L^p(\\R)$, $1 < p <\n2$, whose translates span the whole space, by the zero set of their Fourier\ntransform. This should be contrasted against the classical Wiener theorems\nrelated to the cases $p=1,2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2008 12:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-11"}

A heterogeneous agent based model is set up in which the\nagents are Western economies. A country has a probability of entering a\nrecession in any given year and one of emerging from it the next. In addition,\nthe agents have a unique threshold propensity to import a recession from the\nagents with which they have the strongest connections. They are connected on a\nsmall world topology, and an agent's neighbours at any time are either in\n(state 1) or out (state 0) of recession. If the weighted sum exceeds the\nthreshold, the agent goes into recession. Annual real GDP growth for 17 Western\ncountries 1871-2006 is used as the data set. The distribution of the number of\ncountries in recession in any given year is exponential, as is the duration of\nrecessions within individual countries. The model is calibrated against these\ntwo facts, plus the 'wait time' between recessions. It is able to replicate\nthem successfully.

Several candidates, responsible for this expansion, have\nbeen proposed in the literature, in particular, dark energy models and modified\ngravity, amongst others. One is liable to ask: What is the so-called 'dark\nenergy' that is driving the acceleration of the universe? Is it a vacuum energy\nor a dynamical field (''quintessence'')? Or is the acceleration due to\ninfra-red modifications of Einstein's theory of General Relativity? In the\ncontext of dark matter, two observations, namely, the behavior of the galactic\nrotation curves and the mass discrepancy in galactic clusters, suggest the\nexistence of a (non or weakly interacting) form of dark matter at galactic and\nextra-galactic scales. It has also been proposed that modified gravity can\nexplain the galactic dynamics without the need of introducing dark matter.

Numerical\nsimulations are carried out at the lattice spacing of $a=0.0907(13)$fm on a\n$32^3\\times 64$ lattice with the use of the DDHMC algorithm to reduce the\nup-down quark mass. Further algorithmic improvements make possible the\nsimulation whose ud quark mass is as light as the physical value. The resulting\nPS meson masses range from 702MeV down to 156MeV, which clearly exhibit the\npresence of chiral logarithms. An analysis of the PS meson sector with SU(3)\nChPT reveals that the NLO corrections are large at the physical strange quark\nmass. In order to estimate the physical ud quark mass, we employ the SU(2)\nchiral analysis expanding the strange quark contributions analytically around\nthe physical strange quark mass. The SU(2) LECs ${\\bar l}_3$ and ${\\bar l}_4$\nare comparable with the recent estimates by other lattice QCD calculations.

In condensed matter systems,\nthe subsystems are examined traditionally by using the Green function and\nmean-field-like methods based on the Heisenberg representation. In quantum\ninformation science, the subsystems are handled by composite density matrix,\nits marginals describing the subsystems, and the Kraus representation to\nelucidate the subsystem properties. In this work, a relationship is first\nestablished between the two techniques which appear to be distinct at first\nsight. This will be illustrated in detail by presenting the two methods in the\ncase of the celebrated exactly soluable Jaynes - Cummings model (1963) of a\ntwo-state atom interacting with a one-mode quantized electromagnetic field. The\ndynamics of this system was treated in the Heisenberg representation by\nAckerhalt and Rzazewski (1975). We present here the corresponding subdynamics\nusing Kraus representation. A relationship between the two approaches is\nestablished and the relative merits of the two techniques are discussed in\nelucidating the distinctive features of the subdynamics. The striking effects\nof interaction and entanglement are made transparent in two illustrative\nexamples: the transformations that manifest in non-interacting number and spin\nrepresentations due to interactions in their respective subspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2008 15:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-11"}
