A cascade of collisions then grinds the\nleftovers to dust, forming an observable debris disk. Stellar lifetimes and the\ncollisional cascade limit the growth of protoplanets. The maximum radius of icy\nplanets, roughly 1750 km, is remarkably independent of initial disk mass,\nstellar mass, and stellar age. These objects contain no more than 3% to 4% of\nthe initial mass in solid material. Collisional cascades produce debris disks\nwith maximum luminosity of roughly 0.002 times the stellar luminosity.

Several auction\nmechanisms have been proposed, with variants of the Generalized Second Price\n(GSP) being widely used in practice.\n  A rich body of work on bipartite matching markets builds upon the stable\nmarriage model of Gale and Shapley and the assignment model of Shapley and\nShubik.

Specifically, a limited\nrandomized network coding (L-RNC) scheme - in which intermediate nodes perform\nrandomized encoding based on only a limited number of random coefficients - is\nproposed and its performance bounds are analyzed. Such a L-RNC approach is\napplicable to networks in which nodes have either limited computation/storage\ncapacity or have ambiguity about downstream edge connectivity (e.g., as in ad\nhoc sensor networks). A second tradeoff studied here examines the relationship\nbetween the reliability and the capacity gains of generalized RNC, i.e., how\nthe outage probability of RNC relates to the transmission rate at the source\nnode. This tradeoff reveals that significant reductions in outage probability\nare possible when the source transmits deliberately and only slightly below\nnetwork capacity. This approach provides an effective means to improve the\nfeasibility probability of RNC when the size of the finite field is fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2008 19:03:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 16:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-18"}

This strong turbulence, which may result from\ncosmic ray driven instabilities, both resonant and non-resonant, in the shock\nprecursor, is certain to play a critical role in self-consistent, nonlinear\nmodels of strong, cosmic ray modified shocks. Here we present a Monte Carlo\nmodel of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) accounting for magnetic\nfield amplification through resonant instabilities induced by accelerated\nparticles, and including the effects of dissipation of turbulence upstream of a\nshock and the subsequent precursor plasma heating. Feedback effects between the\nplasma heating due to turbulence dissipation and particle injection are strong,\nadding to the nonlinear nature of efficient DSA. Describing the turbulence\ndamping in a parameterized way, we reach two important results: first, for\nconditions typical of supernova remnant shocks, even a small amount of\ndissipated turbulence energy (~10%) is sufficient to significantly heat the\nprecursor plasma, and second, the heating upstream of the shock leads to an\nincrease in the injection of thermal particles at the subshock by a factor of\nseveral. In our results, the response of the non-linear shock structure to the\nboost in particle injection prevented the efficiency of particle acceleration\nand magnetic field amplification from increasing. We argue, however, that more\nadvanced (possibly, non-resonant) models of turbulence generation and\ndissipation may lead to a scenario in which particle injection boost due to\nturbulence dissipation results in more efficient acceleration and even stronger\namplified magnetic fields than without the dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2008 19:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2008 15:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2008 20:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Moreover,\nattempts to study the critical point numerically face the infamous fermion sign\nproblem, which limits their accuracy. Effective action techniques and\nCallan-Symanzik equations have been very popular in high energy physics, where\nthey enjoy a good record of success. Yet, they have been little exploited for\nfermionic systems in condensed matter physics. In this work, we apply the RG\neffective action and Callan-Symanzik techiques to the heavy fermion problem.

I\nshow that dark matter substructure in the halo of the Galaxy induces\ncharacteristic anisotropies in the diffuse background that could be used to\ndetermine the small-scale dark matter distribution. I calculate the angular\npower spectrum of the emission from dark matter substructure for several models\nof the subhalo population, and show that features in the power spectrum can be\nused to infer the presence of substructure. The shape of the power spectrum is\nlargely unaffected by the subhalo radial distribution and mass function, and\nfor many scenarios I find that a measurement of the angular power spectrum by\nFermi will be able to constrain the abundance of substructure. An anti-biased\nsubhalo radial distribution is shown to produce emission that differs\nsignificantly in intensity and large-scale angular dependence from that of a\nsubhalo distribution which traces the smooth dark matter halo, potentially\nimpacting the detectability of the dark matter signal for a variety of targets\nand methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2008 20:01:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2008 19:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-13"}

Extending previous work [H. Fujisaki, Y. Zhang, and J.E. Straub, J.\nChem. Phys. {\\bf 124}, 144910 (2006)], second-order time-dependent perturbation\ntheory is employed which includes the fluctuations of the parameters in the\nHamiltonian within the vibrational adiabatic approximation. This means that the\ntime-dependent vibrational frequencies along an MD trajectory are obtained via\na partial geometry optimization of the solute with fixed solvent and a\nsubsequent normal mode calculation. Adopting the amide I mode of\nN-methylacetamide in heavy water as a test problem, it is shown that the\ninclusion of dynamic fluctuations may significantly change the vibrational\nenergy relaxation. In particular, it is found that relaxation occurs in two\nphases, because for short times ($\\lesssim$ 200 fs) the spectral density\nappears continuous due to the frequency-time uncertainty relation, while at\nlonger times the discrete nature of the bath becomes apparent. Considering the\nexcellent agreement between theory and experiment, it is speculated if this\nbehavior can explain the experimentally obtained biphasic relaxation the amide\nI mode of N-methylacetamide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2008 02:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Examination of particle motion in combined gravitational and magnetic\nfields shows that these astrophysical jet toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields\ncan be powered by the gravitational energy liberated by accreting dust grains\nthat have become positively charged by emitting photo-electrons. Because a dust\ngrain experiences magnetic forces after becoming charged, but not before,\ncharging can cause irreversible trapping of the grain so dust accretion is a\nconsequence of charging. Furthermore, charging causes canonical angular\nmomentum to replace mechanical angular momentum as the relevant constant of the\nmotion.

RR dominates the\ndynamics of compact remnants that inspiral into a MBH and emit gravitational\nwaves (extreme mass ratio inspiral events, EMRIs). RR can either increase the\nEMRI rate, or strongly suppress it, depending on its still poorly-determined\nefficiency. We use small-scale Newtonian N-body simulations to measure the RR\nefficiency and to explore its possible dependence on the stellar number density\nprofile around the MBH, and the mass-ratio between the MBH and a star (a\nsingle-mass stellar population is assumed). We develop an efficient and robust\nprocedure for detecting and measuring RR in N-body simulations. We present a\nsuite of simulations with a range of stellar density profiles and mass-ratios,\nand measure the mean RR efficiency in the near-Keplerian limit. We do not find\na statistically significant dependence on the density profile or the\nmass-ratio. Our numerical determination of the RR efficiency in the Newtonian,\nsingle-mass population approximations, suggests that RR will likely enhance the\nEMRI rate by a factor of a few over the rates predicted assuming only slow\nstochastic two-body relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2008 13:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The model is able to account for the atomic contrast of\nthe local contact potential difference (CPD) observed while nc-AFM-based Kelvin\nProbe Force Microscopy (KPFM) experiments. With the goal in mind to put in\nevidence this short-range electrostatic force, the Madelung potential arising\nat the surface of the ionic crystal is primarily derived. The expression of the\nforce which is deduced can be split into two major contributions: the first\nstands for the coupling between the microscopic structure of the tip apex and\nthe capacitor formed between the tip, the ionic crystal and the\ncounter-electrode; the second term depicts the influence of the Madelung\nsurface potential on the mesoscopic part of the tip, independently from its\nmicroscopic structure. These short-range electrostatic forces are in the range\nof ten pico-Newtons. When explicitly considering the crystal polarization, an\nanalytical expression of the bias voltage to be applied on the tip to\ncompensate for the local CPD, i.e. to cancel the short-range electrostatic\nforce, is derived. The compensated CPD has the lateral periodicity of the\nMadelung surface potential. However, the strong dependence on the tip geometry,\nthe applied modulation voltage as well as the tip-sample distance, which can\neven lead to an overestimation of the real surface potential, makes\nquantitative KPFM measurements of the local CPD extremely difficult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2008 12:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-10"}

Rotational\ntemperatures are determined from rotational diagrams when a sufficient number\nof lines are detected. Results: Compact emission is detected for all species\nstudied here. For HNCO and CH3CN it mostly arises from source A, CH2CO and\nC2H5OH have comparable strength for both sources and CH3CHO arises exclusively\nfrom source B. HNCO, CH3CN and CH3CHO have rotational temperatures >200 K. The\n(u,v)-visibility data reveal that HNCO also has extended cold emission.\nConclusions: The abundances of the molecules studied here are very similar\nwithin factors of a few to those found in high-mass YSOs. Thus the chemistry\nbetween high- and low-mass objects appears to be independent of luminosity and\ncloud mass. Bigger abundance differences are seen between the A and B source.\nThe HNCO abundance relative to CH3OH is ~4 times higher toward A, which may be\ndue to a higher initial OCN- ice abundances in source A compared to B.\nFurthermore, not all oxygen-bearing species are co-existent. The different\nspatial behavior of CH2CO and C2H5OH compared with CH3CHO suggests that\nhydrogenation reactions on grain-surfaces are not sufficient to explain the\nobserved gas phase abundances. Selective destruction of CH3CHO may result in\nthe anti-coincidence of these species in source A.

In search of low-mass planetary companions we monitored Proxima\nCentauri (M5V) as part of our M dwarf program.

The radial\nintensity profiles, obtained by masking the off-centered nucleus, peak at the\nposition of the ring, with the profiles in the continuum bands broader than\nthat in the Halpha line. The images as well as the radial intensity and color\nprofiles clearly demonstrate the existence of the pre-collisional stellar disk\noutside the star-forming ring, which is in general bluer than the disk internal\nto the ring. The stellar disk seems to have retained its size, with the disk\noutside the ring having a shorter exponential scale length as compared to the\nvalues expected in normal spiral galaxies of comparable masses. The rings in\nour sample of galaxies are found to be located preferentially at around\nhalf-way through the stellar disk. The most likely reason for this preference\nis bias against detecting rings when they are close to the center (they would\nbe confused with the resonant rings), and at the edge of the disk the gas\nsurface density may be below the critical density required for star formation.\nMost of the observed characteristics point to relatively recent collisions (<80\nMyr ago) according to the N-body simulations of Gerber et al.

Magnetic\ninteraction between the Mn atoms is governed by a competition between the\nantiferromagnetic superexchange of the Mn t$_{2g}$ core spins and the\nferromagnetic double exchange of the itinerant e$_g$ electrons. While the core\nelectrons are relatively unaffected by the strain, the orbital character of the\nitinerant electron is strongly affected, which in turn causes a large change in\nthe strength of the ferromagnetic double exchange. The epitaxial strain\nproduces the tetragonal distortion of the MnO$_6$ octahedron, splitting the\nMn-e$_g$ states into x$^2$-y$^2$ and 3z$^2$-1 states, with the former being\nlower in energy, if the strain is tensile in the plane, and opposite if the\nstrain is compressive. For the case of the tensile strain, the resulting higher\noccupancy of the x$^2$-y$^2$ orbital enhances the in-plane ferromagnetic double\nexchange owing to the larger electron hopping in the plane, causing at the same\ntime a reduction of the out-of-plane double exchange. This reduction is large\nenough to be overcome by antiferromagnetic superexchange, which wins to produce\na net antiferromagnetic interaction between the out-of-plane Mn atoms. For the\ncase of the in-plane compressive strain, the reverse happens, viz., that the\nhigher occupancy of the 3z$^2$-1 orbital results in the out-of-plane\nferromagnetic interaction, while the in-plane magnetic interaction remains\nantiferromagnetic. Concrete density-functional results are presented for the\n(LaMnO$_3$)$_1$/(SrMnO$_3$)$_1$ and (LaMnO$_3$)$_1$/(SrMnO$_3$)$_3$\nsuperlattices for various strain conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2008 15:58:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-10"}
