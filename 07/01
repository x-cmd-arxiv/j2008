Thanks to the SDSS DR6, galaxy statistics have\nincreased by a factor of ~9 in the u-band and by a factor of ~4-5 in the rest\nof the SDSS bands with respect to the previous work of Blanton et al. (2003b).\nIn addition, we have achieved a high redshift completeness in our galaxy\nsamples. Firstly, by making use of the survey masks, provided by the NYU-VAGC\nDR6, we have been able to define an area on the sky of high angular redshift\ncompleteness. Secondly, we guarantee that brightness-dependent redshift\nincompleteness is small within the magnitude ranges that define our galaxy\nsamples. With these advances, we have estimated very accurate SDSS DR6 LFs in\nboth the bright and the faint end. In the {0.1}^r-band, our SDSS DR6 luminosity\nfunction is well fitted by a Schechter LF with parameters Phi_{*}=0.90 +/-\n0.07$, M_{*}-5log_{10}h=-20.73 +/- 0.04 and alpha=-1.23 +/- 0.02. As compared\nwith previous results, we find some notable differences. In the bright end of\nthe {0.1}^u-band luminosity function we find a remarkable excess, of ~1.7 dex\nat M_{{0.1}^u}=-20.5, with respect to the best-fit Schechter LF. This excess\nweakens in the {0.1}^g-band, fading away towards the very red {0.1}^z-band. A\npreliminary analysis on the nature of this bright-end bump reveals that it is\nmostly comprised of active galaxies and QSOs. It seems, therefore, that an\nimportant fraction of this exceeding luminosity may come from nuclear activity.\nIn the faint end of the SDSS DR6 luminosity functions, where we can reach 1-1.5\nmagnitudes deeper than the previous SDSS LF estimation, we obtain a steeper\nslope [ABRIDGED].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 17:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-19"}

The measured\nsquared visibilities are compared to the expected visibility of the stellar\nphotospheres based on theoretical photospheric models taking into account\nrotational distortion, searching for potential visibility reduction at short\nbaselines due to circumstellar emission. Our observations bring to light the\npresence of resolved circumstellar emission around one of the six target stars\n(zeta Aql) at the 5 sigma level. The morphology of the emission source cannot\nbe directly constrained because of the sparse spatial frequency sampling of our\ninterferometric data. Using complementary adaptive optics observations and\nradial velocity measurements, we find that the presence of a low-mass companion\nis a likely origin for the excess emission. The potential companion has a\nK-band contrast of four magnitudes, a most probable mass of about 0.6 Msun, and\nis expected to orbit between about 5.5 AU and 8 AU from its host star assuming\na purely circular orbit. Nevertheless, by adjusting a physical debris disc\nmodel to the observed Spectral Energy Distribution of the zeta Aql system, we\nalso show that the presence of hot dust within 10 AU from zeta Aql, producing a\ntotal thermal emission equal to 1.69 +- 0.31% of the photospheric flux in the K\nband, is another viable explanation for the observed near-infrared excess. Our\nre-interpretation of archival near- to far-infrared photometric measurements\nshows however that cold dust is not present around zeta Aql at the sensitivity\nlimit of the IRS and MIPS instruments onboard Spitzer, and urges us to remove\nzeta Aql from the category of bona fide debris disc stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 16:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Further, we apply these results to known radial velocity\nplanets and show that there are unexpectedly high transit probabilities for\nplanets at relatively long periods. For a photometric monitoring campaign which\naims to determine if the planet indeed transits, we calculate the significance\nof a null result and the subsequent constraints that may be applied to orbital\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 20:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is getting clearer that ULXs do not show the\nsame evolutionary sequence between canonical spectral states as stellar-mass\nBHs, nor the same timescale for state transitions. Most ULX spectra are\nconsistent either with a power-law-dominated state (apparently identical to the\ncanonical low/hard state), or with a very high state (or slim-disk state).\nDespite often showing luminosity variability, there is little evidence of ULXs\nsettling into a canonical high/soft state, dominated by a standard disk\n(disk-blackbody spectrum). It is possible that the mass accretion rate (but not\nnecessarily the luminosity) is always higher than Eddington; but there may be\nadditional physical differences between stellar-mass BHs and ULXs, which\ndisfavour transitions to the standard-disk, radio-quiet state in the latter\nclass.

Stroock, Diffusion processes associated\nwith Levy generators, Z. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verw. Gebiete, 32(1975)\n209--244] to the measure-valued context. As for existence, we use particle\nsystem approximation and a perturbation method. This work generalizes the model\nintroduced in [D.A. Dawson, Z. Li, H. Wang, Superprocesses with dependent\nspatial motion and general branching densities, Electron. J. Probab. 6(2001),\nno.25, 33 pp. (electronic)] where quadratic branching mechanism was considered.\nWe also investigate some properties of the process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2008 01:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-02"}

Its pure\nversion displays a second-order phase transition with a vanishing specific heat\ncritical exponent $\\alpha$, thus, the Harris criterion is inconclusive, in that\ndisorder is a relevant or irrelevant perturbation for the critical behavior of\nthe pure system. The main effort was focused on the specific heat and magnetic\nsusceptibility.

Optical/infrared spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) and Halpha photometry confirm that all the knots are\nyoung, with a tentative age sequence from the south-west (oldest knots) to the\nnorth-east (youngest). Optical spectroscopy of the brightest SF region allowed\nus to determine the metallicity (12+log(O/H) = 8.6 +- 0.2) and the extinction\n($A_B$=2.4). This shows that J1023+1952 is made from metal-enriched gas which\nis inconsistent with the hypothesis that it represents a pre-existing dwarf\ngalaxy. Instead, it must be formed from recycled, metal-enrichd gas, expelled\nfrom NGC 3227 or NGC 3226 in a previous phase of the interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2008 15:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The scheme we propose is based in the one dimensional atom or\nPurcell regime, removing the need for high Q cavities that are challenging to\nfabricate. The ground state of the NV center consists of three spin levels\n$^{3}A_{(m=0)}$ and $^{3}A_{(m=\\pm1)}$ (the $\\pm1$ states are near degenerate\nin zero field). These two states can undergo transitions to the excited\n($^{3}E$) state, with an energy difference of $\\approx7-10$ $\\mu$eV between the\ntwo. By choosing the correct Q factor, this small detuning between the two\ntransitions results in a dramatic change in the intensity of reflected light.\nWe show the change in reflected intensity can allow us to read out the ground\nstate spin using a low intensity laser with an error rate of\n$\\approx5.5\\times10^{-3}$, when realistic cavity and experimental parameters\nare considered. Since very low levels of light are used to probe the state of\nthe spin we limit the number of florescence cycles, thereby limiting the non\nspin preserving transitions through the intermediate singlet state $^{1}A$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2008 15:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

We also investigate Vela5B/ASM and\nArielV/ASM archival data and confirm the previously reported ~290 d periodic\nmodulation, and therefore confirming that the super-orbital period is not\nconstant. Finally, we study RXTE/ASM LC before 2005 and find that the\npreviously reported ~150 d period is most likely an artifact due to the use of\na Fourier-power based analysis under the assumption that the modulation has a\nconstant period along the whole data sample. Instead, we find strong\nindications of several discrete changes of the precession period, happening in\ncoincidence with soft and failed state-transition episodes. We also find a hint\nof correlation between the period and the amplitude of the modulation.

In particular, for\na two-brid inflation model with an exponential potential and the condition that\nthe end of inflation is an ellipse in the field space, it was found that, while\nkeeping the other observational quantities within the range consistent with\nobservations, large non-Gaussianity is possible for certain inflationary\ntrajectories, provided that the ratio of the two masses is large. One might\nquestion whether the resulting large non-Gaussianity is specific to this\nparticular form of the potential and the condition for the end of inflation. In\nthis paper, we consider a model of multi-brid inflation with a potential given\nby an exponential function of terms quadratic in the scalar field components.\nWe also consider a more general class of ellipses for the end of inflation than\nthose studied previously. Then, focusing on the case of two-brid inflation, we\nfind that large non-Gaussianity is possible in the present model even for the\nequal-mass case.
