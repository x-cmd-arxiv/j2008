Here we present a mechanism for suppressing\nthe NP effects to FCNC processes. We consider the possibility that the source\nof NP contributions to FCNC processes share the same flavor symmetry underlying\nthe SM source of FCNC processes which are the quark and lepton mass matrices.\nWe call this the principle of shared flavor symmetry. In the flavor symmetric\nlimit, the quark and lepton mixing matrices have fixed forms and there are no\nNP FCNC processes. In the flavor symmetric limit, we take the quark mixing\nmatrix to be the identity matrix and the lepton mixing matrix to be given by\ntri-bimaximal mixing. Realistic mixing matrices are obtained by the small\nbreaking of the flavor symmetry. New contributions to FCNC processes arise\nbecause of non universal breaking of the flavor symmetry in the quark and\nlepton mass matrices and the NP sources of FCNC processes. In particular, we\nwill focus on new FCNC effects that arise due to the breaking of flavor\nsymmetry only in the quark and charged lepton mass matrices but not in the NP\nsector. In this scenario, NP contributions to FCNC processes is linked to the\nsource of flavor symmetry breaking in the quark and charged lepton mass\nmatrices. To demonstrate the mechanism we use a two higgs doublet model as an\nexample of beyond the SM physics though one should be able to adapt this\nmechanism to other models of new physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2008 17:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Particles interact with each other via hard-core\nexclusion potential, and in the asymmetric channel they can only hop in one\ndirection, while on the symmetric lattice particles jump in both directions\nwith equal probabilities. Inter-channel transitions are also allowed at every\nsite of both lattices. Stationary state properties of the system are solved\nexactly in the limit of strong couplings between the channels. It is shown that\nstrong symmetric couplings between totally asymmetric and symmetric channels\nlead to an effective partially asymmetric simple exclusion process (PASEP) and\nproperties of both channels become almost identical. However, strong asymmetric\ncouplings between symmetric and asymmetric channels yield an effective TASEP\nwith nonzero particle flux in the asymmetric channel and zero flux on the\nsymmetric lattice. For intermediate strength of couplings between the lattices\na vertical cluster mean-field method is developed. This approximate approach\ntreats exactly particle dynamics during the vertical transitions between the\nchannels and it neglects the correlations along the channels. Our calculations\nshow that in all cases there are three stationary phases defined by particle\ndynamics at entrances, at exits or in the bulk of the system, while phase\nboundaries depend on the strength and symmetry of couplings between the\nchannels. Extensive Monte Carlo computer simulations strongly support our\ntheoretical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2008 17:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We have been pursuing an approach free of the sign problem, where the\nchemical potential is taken as imaginary and the results are Taylor-expanded in\nmu/T about mu=0, then analytically continued to real mu.\n  Within this approach we have determined the sensitivity of the critical\nchemical potential mu_E to the quark mass, d(\\mu_E)^2/dm_q|_{\\mu_E=0}.
