In stable\nstratification, TKE is generated by the velocity shear and expended through\nviscous dissipation and work against buoyancy forces. The effect of\nstratification is characterized by the ratio of the buoyancy gradient to\nsquared shear, called Richardson number, Ri. It is widely believed that at Ri\nexceeding a critical value, Ric, local shear cannot maintain turbulence, and\nthe flow becomes laminar. We revise this concept by extending the energy\nanalysis to turbulent potential and total energies (TPE and TTE = TKE + TPE),\nconsider their budget equations, and conclude that TTE is a conservative\nparameter maintained by shear in any stratification. Hence there is no\n\"energetics Ric\", in contrast to the hydrodynamic-instability threshold,\nRic-instability, whose typical values vary from 0.25 to 1. We demonstrate that\nthis interval, 0.25<Ri<1, separates two different turbulent regimes: strong\nmixing and weak mixing rather than the turbulent and the laminar regimes, as\nthe classical concept states. This explains persistent occurrence of turbulence\nin the free atmosphere and deep ocean at Ri>>1, clarify principal difference\nbetween turbulent boundary layers and free flows, and provide basis for\nimproving operational turbulence closure models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2008 16:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We present a stochastic\nduplication/innovation model, falling in the class of so-called Chinese\nRestaurant Processes, able to explain this feature of the data. Using only two\nuniversal parameters, related to a minimal number of domains and to the\nrelative weight of innovation to duplication, the model reproduces two\nimportant aspects: (a) the populations of domain classes (the sets, related to\nhomology classes, containing realizations of the same domain in different\nproteins) follow common power-laws whose cutoff is dictated by genome size, and\n(b) the number of domain families is universal and markedly sublinear in genome\nsize. An important ingredient of the model is that the innovation probability\ndecreases with genome size.

We find that for nearby stars, although\nstarspot noise imposes severe restrictions on detectability by the radial\nvelocity technique, it does not significantly affect astrometric detectability\nof habitable zone planets down to below an Earth mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2008 20:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The distribution of IRDCs in the first Galactic quadrant is\nconsistent with the 5 kpc molecular ring picture, while slight trace of spiral\npattern can also be noticed, which needs to be further examined. The IRDCs have\ntypical excitation temperature of 10 K and typical column density of several\n10^{22} cm^{-2}. Their typical physical size is estimated to be several pcs\nusing angular sizes from the Simon catalog. Typical volume density and typical\nLTE mass are ~5000 cm^{-3} and ~5000 M_{sun} respectively.

The equations of accretion flow are solved\nin a simplified one-dimensional model that neglects the latitudinal dependence\nof the flow. In order to solve the integrated equations which govern the\ndynamical behavior of the accretion flow, self-similar solution was used. The\nsolution provides some insight into the dynamics of quasi-spherical accretion\nflow and avoids many of the strictures of the steady self-similar solution.
