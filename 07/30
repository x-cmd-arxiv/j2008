In general, we find that low-density gas near large-scale\noverdensities is ionized and heated earlier than gas in the large-scale,\nunderdense voids. Furthermore, at a later time the IGM temperature is inversely\nrelated to the reionization redshift because gas that is heated earlier has\nmore time to cool through adiabatic expansion and Compton scattering. Thus, at\nthe end of reionization the median temperature-density relation is an inverted\npower-law with slope gamma-1 ~ -0.2, in both models. However, at fixed density,\nthere is up to order unity scatter in the temperature due to the distribution\nof reionization redshifts. Because of the complex equation-of-state, the\nevolved IGM temperature-density relations for the redshift range 4 < z < 6 can\nstill have significant curvature and scatter. These features must be taken into\naccount when interpreting the Lyman alpha absorption in high redshift quasar\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 17:58:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 2008 18:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We first show that the observed trend between SFR vs.\nM$_{V}^{brightest}$ is due to the brightest cluster in a galaxy being\npreferentially young (<15 Myr - for a constant SFR) and hence a good tracer of\nthe current SFR, although we give notable exceptions to this rule. Using a\nseries of Monte Carlo simulations we show that a pure power-law mass function\nwith index, alpha=2, is ruled out by the current data. Instead we find that a\nSchechter function (i.e. a power-law with an exponential truncation at the high\nmass end) provides an excellent fit to the data. Additionally, these\nsimulations show that bound cluster formation (in Msun/yr) represents only\n~8+-3% of the total star-formation within a galaxy, independent of the\nstar-formation rate. From this we conclude that there is only a single mode of\ncluster formation which operates over at least six orders of magnitude in the\nSFR. Using this relation, we can extrapolate backwards in time in order to\nestimate the peak SFR of major merger galaxies, such as NGC7252, NGC1316 and\nNGC3610. The derived SFRs for these galaxies are between a few hundred and a\nfew thousand solar masses per year. The inferred far infrared luminosity of the\ngalaxies, from the extrapolated SFR, places them well within the range of\nUltra-luminous galaxies (ULIRGs) and for NGC 7252 within the Hyper-luminous\ninfrared galaxy regime. Thus, we provide evidence that these post merger\ngalaxies passed through a ULIRG/HLIRG phase and are now evolving passively.\nUsing the current and extrapolated past SFR of NGC 34, we infer that the ULIRG\nphase of this galaxy has lasted for at least 150 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 17:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It may be possible to identify such GW-driven\ninspirals statistically in an electromagnetic (EM) survey for variable sources.\nA GW-driven binary spends a characteristic time T_GW at each orbital separation\nr_orb < r_GW that scales with the corresponding orbital time t_orb as T_GW =\n(const) t_orb^{8/3}. If the coalescing binary produces variations in the EM\nemission on this timescale, then it could be identified as a variable source\nwith a characteristic period t_var = t_orb. The incidence rate of sources with\nsimilar inferred BH masses, showing near-periodic variability on the time-scale\nt_var, would then be proportional to t_var^{8/3}. Luminosity variations\ncorresponding to a fraction f_Edd<0.01 of the Eddington luminosity would have\nbeen missed in current surveys.

This paper\ninvestigates link-by-link channel-coded PNC, in which a critical process at the\nrelay is to transform the superimposed channel-coded packets received from the\ntwo end nodes plus noise, Y3=X1+X2+W3, to the network-coded combination of the\nsource packets, S1 XOR S2 .

A contribution of this paper is the\ninsight that in designing CNC, we should first (i) channel-decode Y3 to the\nsuperimposed source symbols S1+S2 before (ii) transforming S1+S2 to the\nnetwork-coded packets (S1 XOR S2) .

In the presence of the\nspontaneous emission, the mean photon number of the cavity field exhibits\nthreshold behavior indicating that the system may operate as an ordinary laser.\nWhen the spontaneous emission is eliminated on the lasing transition, no\nthreshold is observed for all values of the pumping rate indicating the system\nbecomes a thresholdless laser. Moreover, we find that under a thresholdless\noperation, the mean photon number can increase nonlinearly with the pumping\nrate, and this process is accompanied by a sub-Poisson statistics of the field.\nThis suggests that the nonclassical statistics can be used to distinguish a\nnonlinear operation of the dressed-atom laser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2008 03:03:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2009 04:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In\nthis paper we combine observations of Lyman-alpha absorption towards high\nredshift quasars with the measured UV luminosity function of high redshift\ngalaxies to constrain the escape fraction (f_esc) of ionizing photons from\ngalaxies at z ~ 5.5-6. The observed Lyman-alpha transmission constrains the\nescape fraction to lie in the range f_esc ~ 10-25 % (at z ~ 5.5-6). Excluding\nhalos with M< 10^10 M_sun (as might be expected if galaxy formation is\nsuppressed due to the reionization of the IGM) implies a larger escape fraction\nof f_esc ~ 20-45 %. Using the numerical results to calibrate an analytic\nrelation between the escape fraction and minimum galaxy halo mass we also\nextrapolate our results to a mass (M~10^8 M_sun) corresponding to the hydrogen\ncooling threshold. In this case we find f_esc ~ 5-10 %, consistent with\nobserved estimates at lower redshift. We find that the escape fraction of high\nredshift galaxies must be greater than 5 % irrespepctive of galaxy mass. Based\non these results we use a semi-analytic description to model the reionization\nhistory of the IGM, assuming ionizing sources with escape fractions suggested\nby our numerical simulations. We find that the IBG observed at z ~ 5.5-6\nimplies a sufficient number of ionizing photons to have reionized the Universe\nby z ~ 6. However, if the minimum mass for star-formation were greater than\n10^9 M_sun, the IBG would be over-produced at redshifts less than z ~ 5.

We discuss the stochastic\nproperties of the unbinding/rebinding events and analyze their mean number and\ntheir variance in the framework of simple two-state models. In the\ncalculations, we exploit the analogy to single molecule fluorescence and\nparticularly between unbinding/rebinding and photon emission events.\nEnvironmental fluctuation models are used to describe deviations from Markovian\nbehavior. The second moment of the event-number distribution is found to be\nvery sensitive to possible exchange processes and can thus be used to identify\ntemporal fluctuations of the transition rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2008 08:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We determine\nquantitatively the increase of the mass transfer rate resulting from an extra\nheating. During outbursts, the disc edge heats up the upper layer of the\nsecondary with a flux of the order of the intrinsic stellar flux. This probably\nhas no large effect on the mass transfer rate. In soft X-ray transients, the\nenvironing medium of the disc (corona+wind) could back-scatter a certain\nfraction of the accretion luminosity toward L1. Since soft X-ray transients\nreach high luminosities, even a low efficiency of this effect could yield a\nsignificant heating of L1, whereas we show that in dwarf novae this effect is\nnegligible. Initially the incoming radiation does not penetrate below the\nphotosphere of the secondary.

We present a decoding algorithm to the constructed codes in the\nprojective space.

We show that all potential models considered for the soft\nenergy excess can fit the 0.3-10 keV X-ray spectrum, but that the energy\ndependence of the rapid variability (which is dominated by the QPO) strongly\nsupports a spectral decomposition where the soft excess is from low temperature\nComptonization of the disc emission and remains mostly constant, while the\nrapid variability is produced by the power law tail changing in normalization.\nThe presence of the QPO in the tail rather than in the disc is a common feature\nin black hole binaries, but low temperature Comptonization of the disc spectrum\nis not generally seen in these systems. The main exception to this is GRS\n1915+105, the only black hole binary which routinely shows super-Eddington\nluminosities.

Canonical gravity provides means to analyze the field\nequations as well as observable quantities, the latter even in coordinate\nindependent form.
