Our main\nconstraint is our measurement of the Lya forest opacity at redshifts 2<z<4.2\nfrom 86 high-resolution quasar spectra. In addition, we impose the requirements\nthat HI must be reionized by z=6 and HeII by z~3, and consider estimates of the\nhardness of the ionizing background from HI to HeII column density ratios. The\nderived hydrogen photoionization rate is remarkably flat over the Lya forest\nredshift range covered. Because the quasar luminosity function is strongly\npeaked near z~2, the lack of redshift evolution indicates that star-forming\ngalaxies likely dominate the photoionization rate at z>~3. Combined with direct\nmeasurements of the galaxy UV luminosity function, this requires only a small\nfraction f_esc~0.5% of galactic hydrogen ionizing photons to escape their\nsource for galaxies to solely account for the entire ionizing background. Under\nthe assumption that the galactic UV emissivity traces the star formation rate,\ncurrent state-of-the-art observational estimates of the star formation rate\ndensity appear to underestimate the total photoionization rate at z~4 by a\nfactor ~4, are in tension with recent determinations of the UV luminosity\nfunction, and fail to reionize the Universe by z~6 if extrapolated to\narbitrarily high redshift. A theoretical star formation history peaking earlier\nfits the Lya forest photoionization rate well, reionizes the Universe in time,\nand is in better agreement with the rate of z~4 gamma-ray bursts observed by\nSwift. Quasars suffice to doubly ionize helium by z~3 and likely contribute a\nnon-negligible and perhaps dominant fraction of the hydrogen ionizing\nbackground at their z~2 peak.

The predicted frequencies are a\nfrequency around 530 T arising from the electron pocket, a hole frequency at\naround 1650 T, and a new low frequency from a smaller hole pocket at 250 T for\nwhich there are some indications that require further investigation. The\noscillation corresponding to the electron pocket will be further split due to\nbilayer coupling but the splitting is sufficiently small to require more\nrefined measurements. The truly incommensurate $d$-density wave breaks both\ntime reversal and inversion but the product of these two symmetry operations is\npreserved. There is some similarity of our results with the spiral spin density\nwave order, which, as pointed out by Overhauser, also breaks time reversal and\ninversion.

On physical\ngrounds, the escape of particles from the upstream region of a shock has to be\nexpected in all those situations in which the maximum momentum of accelerated\nparticles, $p_{max}$, decreases with time, as is the case for the Sedov-Taylor\nphase of expansion of a shell Supernova Remnant, when both the shock velocity\nand the cosmic ray induced magnetization decrease. In this situation, at each\ntime $t$, particles with momenta larger than $p_{max}(t)$ leave the system from\nupstream, carrying away a large fraction of the energy if the shock is strongly\nmodified by the presence of cosmic rays. This phenomenon is of crucial\nimportance for explaining the cosmic ray spectrum detected at Earth. In this\npaper we discuss how this escape flux appears in the different approaches to\nnon-linear diffusive shock acceleration, and especially in the quasi-stationary\nsemi-analytical kinetic ones. We apply our calculations to the Sedov-Taylor\nphase of a typical supernova remnant, including in a self-consistent way\nparticle acceleration, magnetic field amplification and the dynamical reaction\non the shock structure of both particles and fields. Within this framework we\ncalculate the temporal evolution of the maximum energy reached by the\naccelerated particles and of the escape flux towards upstream infinity. The\nlatter quantity is directly related to the cosmic ray spectrum detected at\nEarth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2008 21:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 13:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The resulting expression for the hopping rate takes an\nactivated form, and the barrier height for the hopping is ``self-generated'' in\nthe sense that it is present only in those states where the dynamics exhibits a\nwell defined plateau.

Electrons triggered and identified by the Barrel\nElectro-Magnetic Calorimeter (BEMC), pure protons and pions from $\\Lambda\\to\np+\\pi^{-}$ ($\\bar{\\Lambda}\\to \\bar{p}+\\pi^{+}$), and\n$K^{0}_{S}\\to\\pi^{+}+\\pi^{-}$ decays are used to obtain the $dE/dx$ value and\nits width at given $\\beta\\gamma=p/m$. We found that the deviation of the\n$dE/dx$ from the Bichsel function can be up to $0.4\\sigma$ ($\\sim3%$) in p+p\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV taken and subsequently calibrated in year\n2005. The deviation is approximately a function of $\\beta\\gamma$ independent of\nparticle species and can be described with a function of $f(x) =\nA+\\frac{B}{C+x^{2}}$. The deviations obtained with this method are used to\nre-calibrate the data sample from p+p collision for physics analysis of\nidentified hadron spectra and their correlations up to transverse momentum of\n15 GeV/$c$. The ratio of $e^{-}/e^{+}$ (dominantly from $\\gamma$-conversion) is\nalso used to correct the residual asymmetry in the negative and positive\ncharged hadrons due to momentun distortion in the STAR TPC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jul 2008 15:40:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2009 02:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-26"}
