We have used the publicly available N-body/SPH code\nHYDRA, to which we have added a set of star formation criteria, and\nprescriptions for chemical enrichment (taking into account contributions from\nboth SNIa and SNII), supernova feedback, and gas cooling. The models follow the\nevolution of an initially homogeneous gas cloud collapsing in a pre-existing\ndark-matter halo. These simplified initial conditions are supported by the\nmerger trees of isolated dwarf galaxies extracted from the milli-Millennium\nSimulation.\n  The star-formation histories of the model galaxies exhibit burst-like\nbehaviour. These bursts are a consequence of the blow-out and subsequent\nin-fall of gas. The amount of gas that leaves the galaxy for good is found to\nbe small, in absolute numbers, ranging between 3x10^7 Msol and 6x10^7 Msol .\nFor the least massive models, however, this is over 80 per cent of their\ninitial gas mass. The local fluctuations in gas density are strong enough to\ntrigger star-bursts in the massive models, or to inhibit anything more than\nsmall residual star formation for the less massive models. Between these\nstar-bursts there can be time intervals of several Gyrs.\n  We have compared model predictions with available data for the relations\nbetween luminosity and surface brightness profile, half-light radius, central\nvelocity dispersion, broad band colour (B-V) and metallicity, as well as the\nlocation relative to the fundamental plane.

Then, the original\nresults are presented. First, the 4D Vasiliev equations are formulated in\nspace-times with signatures (4-p,p) and non-vanishing cosmological constant,\nand some new exact solutions are found, depending on continuous and discrete\nparameters: (a) an SO(4-p,p)-invariant family of solutions; (b) non-maximally\nsymmetric solutions with vanishing Weyl tensors and higher-spin gauge fields,\nthat differ from the maximally symmetric background solutions in the auxiliary\nfield sector; and (c) solutions of the chiral models with an infinite tower of\nWeyl tensors proportional to totally symmetric products of two principal\nspinors. These are apparently the first exact 4D solutions with non-vanishing\nmassless higher-spin fields.

The conformal mapping approach is illustrated by means of\nexplicit calculations of the geometric effects encountered in the study of some\nstrongly curved surfaces and by deriving universal bounds on their strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2008 18:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The basis for our analysis is a chiral quark\nmatter model of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type with diquark pairing in the\nspin-1 single flavor (CSL), spin-0 two flavor (2SC) and three flavor (CFL)\nchannels. We find that nucleon dissociation sets in at about the saturation\ndensity, n_0, when the down-quark Fermi sea is populated (d-quark dripline) due\nto the flavor asymmetry induced by beta-equilibrium and charge neutrality. At\nabout 3n_0 u-quarks appear and a two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase\nis formed. The s-quark Fermi sea is populated only at still higher baryon\ndensity, when the quark chemical potential is of the order of the dynamically\ngenerated strange quark mass. We construct two different hybrid equations of\nstate (EoS) using the Dirac-Brueckner Hartree-Fock (DBHF) approach and the EoS\nby Shen et al. in the nuclear matter sector. The corresponding hybrid star\nsequences have maximum masses of, respectively, 2.1 and 2.0 M_sun. Two- and\nthree-flavor quark-matter phases exist only in gravitationally unstable hybrid\nstar solutions in the DBHF case, while the Shen-based EoS produce stable\nconfigurations with a 2SC phase-component in the core of massive stars. Nucleon\ndissociation via d-quark drip could act as a deep crustal heating process,\nwhich apparently is required to explain superbusts and cooling of X-ray\ntransients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2008 18:03:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 19:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-22"}

We find two superconducting\ngaps with different values: a large gap (~ 12 meV) on the two small hole-like\nand electron-like FS sheets, and a small gap (~ 6 meV) on the large hole-like\nFS. Both gaps, closing simultaneously at the bulk Tc, are nodeless and nearly\nisotropic around their respective FS sheets. The isotropic pairing interactions\nare strongly orbital dependent, as the ratio 2Delta/kBTc switches from weak to\nstrong coupling on different bands. The same and surprisingly large\nsuperconducting gap due to strong pairing on the two small FS, which are\nconnected by the (pi, 0) spin-density-wave vector in the parent compound,\nstrongly suggests that the pairing mechanism originates from the inter-band\ninteractions between these two nested FS sheets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2008 18:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-14"}

The bidomain model is a\nsystem consisting of a possibly degenerate parabolic PDE coupled with an\nelliptic PDE for the transmembrane and extracellular potentials, respectively.\nThis system of two scalar PDEs is supplemented by a time-dependent ODE modeling\nthe evolution of the so-called gating variable. In the simpler sub-case of the\nmonodomain model, the elliptic PDE reduces to an algebraic equation. Two simple\nmodels for the membrane and ionic currents are considered, the\nMitchell-Schaeffer model and the simpler FitzHugh-Nagumo model.

The final reduced problem is governed by an integrable\ntwo-dimensional system of differential equations with solutions represented as\nplanar trajectories. Another key to Synge's analysis was his classification of\nthe problem into three distinct cases: elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic\ncorresponding, respectively, to the sum of products of pairs of vortex\nstrengths being positive, negative or zero. The reduction of the vortex\nconfiguration, a curve in space to a planar curve is one-to-one, except along a\ncritical planar curve C in the parabolic case. Each point on C represents a\ntriangle of unit perimeter corresponding to a family of similar vortex\nconfigurations, expanding or contracting.

SN 2008D attracted special attention\ndue to the serendipitous discovery of an associated X-ray transient. In this\npaper, we study the properties of NGC 2770 and specifically the three SN sites\nto investigate whether this galaxy is in any way peculiar to cause a high\nfrequency of SNe Ib. We model the global SED of the galaxy from broadband data\nand derive a star-formation and SN rate comparable to the values of the Milky\nWay. We further study the galaxy using longslit spectroscopy covering the major\naxis and the three SN sites. From the spectroscopic study we find subsolar\nmetallicities for the SN sites, a high extinction and a moderate star-formation\nrate. In a high resolution spectrum, we also detect diffuse interstellar bands\nin the line-of-sight towards SN 2008. A comparison of NGC 2770 to the global\nproperties of a galaxy sample with high SN occurance (at least 3 SN in the last\n100 years) suggests that NGC 2770 is not particularly destined to produce such\nan enhancement of observed SNe observed. Its properties are also very different\nfrom gamma-ray burst host galaxies. Statistical considerations on SN Ib\ndetection rates give a probability of ~1.5% to find a galaxy with three Ib SNe\ndetected in 10 years. The high number of rare Ib SNe in this galaxy is\ntherefore likely to be a coincidence rather than special properties of the\ngalaxy itself. NGC 2770 has a small irregular companion, NGC 2770B, which is\nhighly starforming, has a very low mass and one of the lowest metallicities\ndetected in the nearby universe as derived from longslit spectroscopy. In the\nmost metal poor part, we even detect Wolf-Rayet features, against the current\nmodels of WR stars which require high metallicities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 01:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

However, many cellular cargos are\nobserved to move bidirectionally, involving both plus-end and minus-end\ndirected motors. The presumably simplest mechanism for such bidirectional\ntransport is provided by a tug-of-war between the two motor species. This\nmechanism is studied theoretically using the load-dependent transport\nproperties of individual motors as measured in single-molecule experiments. In\ncontrast to previous expectations, such a tug-of-war is found to be highly\ncooperative and to exhibit seven different motility regimes depending on the\nprecise values of the single motor parameters. The sensitivity of the transport\nprocess to small parameter changes can be used by the cell to regulate its\ncargo traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 07:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-04"}

Using CB-BLS will allow to easily harness the\nmassive ground- and space- based photometric surveys to look for these objects.\nDetecting transiting CB planets is expected to have a wide range of\nimplications, for e.g.: The frequency of CB planets depend on the planetary\nformation mechanism - and planets in close pairs of stars provides a most\nrestrictive constraint on planet formation models. Furthermore, understanding\nvery high precision light curves is limited by stellar parameters - and since\nfor EBs the stellar parameters are much better determined, the resultant\nplanetary structure models will have significantly smaller error bars, maybe\neven small enough to challenge theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 10:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

The modulation period is found to be 16.5462 d,\nwhich is about half of that was reported earlier from visual observations.\nPreviously unknown features of the modulation have been detected. Besides the\nmain modulation frequency f_m, sidelobe modulation frequencies around the\npulsation frequency and its harmonics appear at +/- 2 f_m, +/- 4 f_m, and +/-\n12.5 f_m separations as well. Residual signals in the prewhitened light curve\nlarger than the observational noise appear at the minimum-rising branch-maximum\nphase of the pulsation, which most probably arise from some stochastic/chaotic\nbehaviour of the pulsation/modulation. The Fourier parameters of the mean light\ncurve differ significantly from the averages of the Fourier parameters of the\nobserved light curves in the different phases of the Blazhko cycle.\nConsequently, the mean light curve of MW Lyrae never matches its actual light\nvariation. The Phi_21, Phi_31 phase differences in different phases of the\nmodulation show unexpected stability during the Blazhko cycle. A new\nphenomenological description of the light curve variation is defined that\nseparates the amplitude and phase (period) modulations utilising the phase\ncoherency of the lower order Fourier phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 11:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The detection\nof BAO requires measuring galaxy positions and redshifts. \"Transversal\"\n(angular distance) BAO measure the angular size of this scale, while\n\"line-of-sight\" (or \"radial\") BAO require precise redshifts, but provide a\ndirect measurement of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts, a more\nsensitive probe of dark energy. The main goal of this paper is to show that a\nprecision of sigma_z ~0.003(1 + z) is sufficient to measure BAO in the radial\ndirection. This precision can be achieved for bright, red galaxies, by using a\nfilter system comprising about 40 filters, each with a width of ~100 A, from ~\n4000 A to ~ 8000 A, supplemented by two broad-band filters. We describe a\npractical implementation, a new galaxy survey, PAU, to be carried out with a\ntelescope/camera combination with an etendue of about 20 m^2deg^2, and covering\n8000 sq. deg. in the sky in four years. We expect to measure positions and\nredshifts for over 14 million red, early-type galaxies with L > L* and i_AB <\n22.5 in the interval 0.1 < z < 0.9, with sigma_z < 0.003(1 + z). This\npopulation has a number density n > 10^-3 Mpc^-3 h^3 within the 9 (Gpc/h)^3\nvolume of the survey, ensuring that the error in the determination of the BAO\nscale is not limited by shot-noise. By itself, such a survey will deliver\nprecisions of order 5% in the dark-energy equation of state parameter w, if\nassumed constant, and can determine its time derivative when combined with\nfuture CMB measurements. In addition, PAU will yield high-quality redshift and\nlow-resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of millions of other galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 13:32:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2008 15:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 16:13:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 14:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

For a realistic modulation\nthe spin at the molecular orbital is Kondo screened by the even conduction\nchannel even in the regime of strong coupling.

Is this\nstill true when the metallicity strictly equals zero? The aim of our study is\nto get an answer to this question, and to determine how rotation changes the\nevolution and the chemical signature of the primordial stars. We have\ncalculated 14 differentially-rotating and non-rotating stellar models at zero\nmetallicity, with masses between 9 and 200 Msol. The evolution has been\nfollowed up to the pre-supernova stage. We find that Z=0 models rotate with an\ninternal profile Omega(r) close to local angular momentum conservation, because\nof a very weak core-envelope coupling. Rotational mixing drives a H-shell boost\ndue to a sudden onset of CNO cycle in the shell. This boost leads to a high 14N\nproduction. Generally, the rotating models produce much more metals than their\nnon-rotating counterparts. The mass loss is very low, even for the models that\nreach the critical velocity during the main sequence. Due to the low mass loss\nand the weak coupling, the core retains a high angular momentum at the end of\nthe evolution. The high rotation rate at death probably leads to a much\nstronger explosion than previously expected, changing the fate of the models.\nThe inclusion of our yields in a chemical evolution model of the Galactic halo\npredicts log values of N/O, C/O and 12C/13C ratios of -2.2, -0.95 and 50\nrespectively at log O/H +12 = 4.2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 14:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Especially interesting\nare isospin violating hadronic precesses of these mesons into 3pi systems\ndriven by the term of QCD Lagrangian which depends on the mass difference of\nthe u and d quarks. When an eta or an eta-prime meson is created in the\nhadronic reaction signals from such decays may be significantly obscured by the\nprompt production of pi mesons. In this thesis we present the estimation of the\nupper limit of the background due to prompt pion production for the eta-prime\n->3pi0 and eta-prime->pi+pi-pi decays. Using the data from proton-proton\ncollisions measured by the COSY-11 group we have extracted differential cross\nsections for the multimeson production with the invariant mass corresponding to\nthe mass of the eta-prime meson. Based on these results and on parametrizations\nof the total cross sections for the eta-prime meson as well as parametrization\nof the upper limit for the prompt pi+pi-pi0 production in the collisions of\nprotons we discuss in details the feasibility of a measurement of the eta-prime\nmeson decay into 3pi channels with the WASA-at-COSY facility.
