This rate is proportional to the clumping factor C\n= <rho_b^2> / avg(rho_b)^2, where rho_b and avg(rho_b) are the local and cosmic\nmean baryon density, respectively, and the brackets < > indicate spatial\naveraging over the recombining gas in the IGM. We perform a suite of\ncosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations that include radiative\ncooling to calculate the volume-weighted clumping factor of the IGM at\nredshifts z >= 6. We focus on the effect of photo-ionisation heating by a\nuniform ultra-violet background and find that photo-heating strongly reduces\nthe clumping factor because the increased pressure support smoothes out\nsmall-scale density fluctuations. Photo-ionisation heating is often said to\nprovide a negative feedback on the reionisation of the IGM because it\nsuppresses the cosmic star formation rate by boiling the gas out of low-mass\nhalos. However, because of the reduction of the clumping factor it also makes\nit easier to keep the IGM ionised. Photo-heating therefore also provides a\npositive feedback which, while known to exist, has received much less\nattention. We demonstrate that this positive feedback is in fact very strong.\nUsing conservative assumptions, we find that if the IGM was reheated at z >~ 9,\nthe observed population of star-forming galaxies at z = 6 may be sufficient to\nkeep the IGM ionised, provided that the fraction of ionising photons that\nescape the star-forming regions to ionise the IGM is larger than 0.2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 16:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2009 08:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-03"}

The X-ray emission originates in hot gas (kT ~ 0.75 keV), which may\neither be contained within the radio bubbles, or in a shell of hot gas\nsurrounding them. We consider three models for the origin of the hot gas: (1) a\nstarburst-driven galactic wind, (2) shocked gas associated with the expanding\nradio bubbles, and (3) gas heated and entrained into the bubbles by jet/ISM\ninteractions in the inner AGN outflow. We rule out a galactic wind based on\nsignificant differences from known galactic wind systems. The tight\ncorrespondence between the brightest X-ray emission and the radio emission in\nthe inner outflow from the Seyfert nucleus, as well as a correlation between\nX-ray and radio spectral features suggestive of shocks and particle\nacceleration, lead us to favour the third model; however, we cannot firmly rule\nout a model in which the bubbles are driving large-scale shocks into the galaxy\nISM. In either AGN-driven heating scenario, the total energy stored in the hot\ngas is high, ~10^56 ergs, comparable to the energetic impact of low-power radio\ngalaxies such as Centaurus A, and will have a dramatic impact on the galaxy and\nits surroundings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 16:19:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 15:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

With this breakthrough it is now possible to measure in very good\nhydrostatic pressure conditions up to 7 GPa, which is about twice the pressure\nattainable in piston-cylinder cells. The pressure gradient in the cell,\nestimated from the superconducting transition width of lead, is reduced by a\nfactor of five in the liquid medium with respect to steatite. By the use of\nnon-magnetic materials for the anvils and the clamp and due to the small\ndimensions of the latter, our device is specially suitable for\nmagneto-transport measurements in dilution fridges.

The flux of the\nPWN itself is dominated by synchrotron emission at shorter (IRAC) wavelengths,\nwith a warm dust component longward of 20 $\\mu$m. We show that this dust\ncontinuum can be explained by a small amount ($\\sim 1-3 \\times 10^{-3} \\msun$)\nof dust at a temperature of $\\sim 50-65$ K, heated by the shock wave generated\nby the PWN being driven into the inner edge of the ejecta. This is evidently\ndust synthesized in the supernova. We also report the detection of several\nlines in the spectrum of the PWN, and present kinematic information about the\nPWN as determined from these lines. Kinematics are consistent with previous\noptical studies of this object. Line strengths are also broadly consistent with\nwhat one expects from optical line strengths. We find that lines arise from\nslow ($\\sim 20$ km s$^{-1}$) shocks driven into oxygen-rich clumps in the shell\nswept-up by an iron-nickel bubble, which have a density contrast of $\\sim\n100-200$ relative to the bulk of the ejecta, and that faster shocks ($\\sim 250$\nkm s$^{-1}$) in the hydrogen envelope are required to heat dust grains to\nobserved temperatures. We infer from estimates of heavy-element ejecta\nabundances that the progenitor star was likely in the range of 20-25 $M_\\odot$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 18:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We split our galaxy sample in star-forming galaxies, galaxies with\noptical AGN activity and radio sources. We find a smooth transition in halo\nmass as the activity of central galaxies changes from star formation to optical\nAGN activity to radio emission. Star-forming centrals preferentially reside in\nhaloes with M<10^{12} Msun, central galaxies with optical-AGN activity\ntypically inhabit haloes with M \\sim 10^{13} Msun, and centrals emitting in the\nradio mainly reside in haloes more massive than 10^{14} Msun. Although this\nseems to suggest that the environment (halo mass) determines the type of\nactivity of its central galaxy, we find a similar trend with stellar mass:\ncentral star formers typically have stellar masses below 10^{10} Msun, while\noptical-AGN hosts and central radio sources have characteristic stellar masses\nof 10^{10.8} Msun and 10^{11.6} Msun, respectively. Since more massive haloes\ntypically host more massive centrals, it is unclear whether the activity of a\ncentral galaxy is causally connected to its stellar mass or to its halo mass.\nIn general, satellite galaxies have their activity suppressed wrt central\ngalaxies of the same stellar mass. At fixed stellar mass, we find that the\nactivity of satellite galaxies depends only weakly on halo mass. In fact, for\nsatellite galaxies the dependence of galaxy activity on halo mass is more than\nfour times weaker than the dependence on stellar mass. As we discuss, all these\nresults are consistent with a picture in which low mass haloes accrete cold\ngas, while massive haloes have coronae of hot gas that promote radio activity\nof their central galaxies.

Despite the great simplicity of our EBM, it captures\nreasonably well the seasonal cycle of global energetic fluxes at Earth's\nsurface. It also performs satisfactorily against a full-physics climate model\nof a highly oblique Earth-like planet, in an unusual regime of circulation\ndominated by heat transport from the poles to the equator.

For scattering to occur,\nthe planets must either form in -- or migrate into -- an unstable\nconfiguration. In either case, it is likely that a residual gas disk, with a\nmass comparable to that of the planets, will be present when scattering occurs.\nUsing explicit hydrodynamic simulations, we study the impact of gas disks on\nthe outcome of two-planet scattering. We assume a specific model in which the\nplanets are driven toward instability by gravitational torques from an outer\nlow mass disk. We find that the accretion of mass and angular momentum that\noccurs when a scattered planet impacts the disk can strongly influence the\nsubsequent dynamics by reducing the number of close encounters. The\neccentricity of the innermost surviving planet at the epoch when the system\nbecomes Hill stable is not substantially altered from the gas-free case, but\nthe outer planet is circularized by its interaction with the disk. The\nsignature of scattering initiated by gas disk migration is thus a high fraction\nof low eccentricity planets at larger radii accompanying known eccentric\nplanets. Subsequent secular evolution of the two planets in the presence of\ndamping can further damp both eccentricities, and tends to push systems away\nfrom apsidal alignment and toward anti-alignment. We note that the late burst\nof accretion when the outer planet impacts the disk is in principle observable,\nprobably via detection of a strong near-IR excess in systems with otherwise\nweak disk and stellar accretion signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 20:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our model corresponds to a network of coupled\nnon-negative matrix factorization (NMF) modules, which we refer to as a\npositive factor network (PFN). The data model is linear, subject to\nnon-negativity constraints, so that observation data consisting of an additive\ncombination of individually representable observations is also representable by\nthe network. This is a desirable property for modeling problems in\ncomputational auditory scene analysis, since distinct sound sources in the\nenvironment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding\nmagnitude spectrogram. We propose inference and learning algorithms that\nleverage existing NMF algorithms and that are straightforward to implement. We\npresent a target tracking example and provide results for synthetic observation\ndata which serve to illustrate the interesting properties of PFNs and motivate\ntheir potential usefulness in applications such as music transcription, source\nseparation, and speech recognition. We show how a target process characterized\nby a hierarchical state transition model can be represented as a PFN. Our\nresults illustrate that a PFN which is defined in terms of a single target\nobservation can then be used to effectively track the states of multiple\nsimultaneous targets. Our results show that the quality of the inferred target\nstates degrades gradually as the observation noise is increased. We also\npresent results for an example in which meaningful hierarchical features are\nextracted from a spectrogram. Such a hierarchical representation could be\nuseful for music transcription and source separation applications.

In particular we focus on disk-like galaxies with stellar disk\ntruncations. Using UDF, GOODS and SDSS data we show how the position of the\nbreak (i.e. a direct estimator of the size of the stellar disk) evolves with\ntime since z~1. Our findings agree with an evolution on the radial position of\nthe break by a factor of 1.3+-0.1 in the last 8 Gyr for galaxies with similar\nstellar masses. We also present radial color gradients and how they evolve with\ntime. At all redshift we find a radial inside-out bluing reaching a minimum at\nthe position of the break radius, this minimum is followed by a reddening\noutwards. Our results constraint several galaxy disk formation models and\nfavour a scenario where stars are formed inside the break radius and are\nrelocated in the outskirts of galaxies through secular processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2008 12:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-29"}

We adopt\na four dimensional point of view where the degrees of freedom on the brane\nconstitute an open quantum system coupled to an environment composed of the\nbulk gravitons. Due to the expansion of the universe, the brane degrees of\nfreedom and the bulk degrees of freedom interact as they propagate forward in\ntime. Brane excitations may decay through the emission of bulk gravitons which\nmay escape to future infinity, leading to a sort of dissipation from the four\ndimensional point of view of an observer on the brane. Bulk gravitons may also\nbe reflected off of the curved bulk and reabsorbed by the brane, thereby\ntransformed into quanta on the brane, leading to a sort of nonlocality from the\nfour dimensional point of view. The dissipation and the nonlocality are encoded\ninto the retarded bulk propagator. We estimate the dissipation rates of the\nbound state as well as of the matter degrees of freedom at different\ncosmological epochs and for different sources of matter on the brane. We use a\nnear-brane limit of the bulk geometry for the study when purely nonlocal bulk\neffects are encountered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2008 13:33:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 14:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-12"}
