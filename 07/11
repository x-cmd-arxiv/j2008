The code\ncombines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations\nof templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its\nuser interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that\nthe default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the\npriors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on\nsemi-analytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel\nrest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength\nregions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties\nare realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Q_z, that provides a\nrobust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate.\nDespite the fact that EAZY is not \"trained\" on spectroscopic samples, the code\n(with default parameters) performs very well on existing public datasets. For\nK-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields we find a 1-sigma scatter\nin dz/(1+z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for\nthe FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2008 18:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The striking\ndifferences in the predicted transition mechanism for the opening of the two\ndomains of calmodulin (CaM) emphasizes that inherent flexibility is key to\nunderstanding the complex conformational changes that occur in proteins. In\nparticular, the C-terminal domain of CaM (cCaM) which is inherently less\nflexible than its N-terminal domain (nCaM) reveals \"cracking\" or local partial\nunfolding during the open/closed transition. This result is in harmony with the\npicture that cracking relieves local stresses due to conformational\ndeformations of a sufficiently rigid protein. We also compare the\nconformational transition in a recently studied \"even-odd\" paired fragment of\nCaM. Our results rationalize the different relative binding affinities of the\nEF-hands in the engineered fragment compared to the intact \"odd-even\" paired\nEF-hands (nCaM and cCaM) in terms of changes in flexibility along the\ntransition route.

These data\nwere fitted with a synchrotron radiation model. The nonthermal electron\nspectrum used to compute the photon emission spectra is the traditional\nexponentially cut off power law, with one notable difference: The power-law\nindex is not a constant. It is a linear function of the logarithm of the\nmomentum. This functional form enables us to show, for the first time, that the\nsynchrotron spectrum of SN 1006 seems to flatten with increasing energy. The\neffective power-law index of the electron spectrum is 2.2 at 1 GeV (i.e., radio\nsynchrotron-emitting momenta) and 2.0 at about 10 TeV (i.e., X-ray\nsynchrotron-emitting momenta). This amount of change in the index is\nqualitatively consistent with theoretical models of the amount of curvature in\nthe proton spectrum of the remnant. The evidence of spectral curvature implies\nthat cosmic rays are dynamically important instead of being \"test\" particles.\nThe spectral analysis also provides a means of determining the critical\nfrequency of the synchrotron spectrum associated with the highest-energy\nelectrons. The critical frequency seems to vary along the northeastern rim,\nwith a maximum value of 1.1e17 (0.6e17 - 2.1e17) Hz.

A\ncomparison of observed line ratio values was made to those predicted by the\ntemperature and electron density dependent models of Case B hydrogen\nrecombination line theory.

We find that a local\nLagrangian bias and redshift-space distortions are naturally incorporated in\nour formalism of perturbation theory with a resummation technique via the\nLagrangian picture. Our formalism is applicable to any biasing scheme which is\nlocal in Lagrangian space, including the halo bias as a special case. Weakly\nnonlinear effects on halo clustering in redshift space are analytically\ngiven.We assume only a fundamental idea of the halo model: haloes form\naccording to the extended Press-Schechter theory, and the spatial distributions\nare locally biased in Lagrangian space. There is no need for assuming the\nspherical collapse model to follow the dynamical evolution, which is\nadditionally assumed in standard halo prescriptions. One-loop corrections to\nthe power spectrum and correlation function of haloes in redshift space are\nexplicitly derived and presented. Instead of relying on expensive numerical\nsimulations, our approach provides an analytic way of investigating the weakly\nnonlinear effects, simultaneously including the nonlinear biasing and nonlinear\nredshift-space distortions. Nonlinearity introduces a weak scale dependence in\nthe halo bias.

Given a set of robots with\narbitrary initial location and no initial agreement on a global coordinate\nsystem, gathering requires that all robots reach the exact same but not\npredetermined location while scattering aims at scatter robots such that no two\nrobots share the same location. Both deterministic gathering and scattering\nhave been proved impossible under arbitrary schedulers therefore probabilistic\nsolutions have been recently proposed.

Using as an example a human knee joint, this\npaper proposes a new coupled-loading-rate hypothesis, which states that a\ngeneric cause of any musculo-skeletal injury is a Euclidean jolt, or\nSE(3)-jolt, an impulsive loading that hits a joint in several coupled\ndegrees-of-freedom simultaneously. Informally, it is a rate-of-change of joint\nacceleration in all 6-degrees-of-freedom simultaneously, times the\ncorresponding portion of the body mass. In the case of a human knee, this\nhappens when most of the body mass is on one leg with a semi-flexed knee -- and\nthen, caused by some external shock, the knee suddenly `jerks'; this can happen\nin running, skiing, sports games (e.g., soccer, rugby) and various\ncrashes/impacts.

When the\nvelocity dispersion is larger than the planetesimals' surface escape velocity,\ncollisions between planetesimals do not result in accretion, and may even lead\nto their destruction.

We illustrate this mapping first with the\nstandard theory of sound, as vibrations of a medium, which itself may be\nundergoing fluid motion, and which is covariant under Galilean coordinate\ntransformations. By introducing a different non-physical class of space and\ntime coordinates it may be cast into a form that is covariant under \"Lorentz\ntransformations\" wherein the speed of sound is now the \"invariant speed\". If\nthis latter formalism were taken as fundamental and complete we would be lead\nto the introduction of a pseudo-Riemannian \"spacetime\" description of sound,\nwith a metric characterised by an \"invariant speed of sound\". This analysis is\nan allegory for the development of 20th century physics, but where the Lorentz\ncovariant Maxwell equations were constructed first, and the Galilean form was\nlater constructed by Hertz, but ignored. It is shown that the Lorentz\ncovariance of the Maxwell equations only occurs because of the use of\nnon-physical space and time coordinates. The use of this class of coordinates\nhas confounded 20th century physics, and resulted in the existence of a\n\"flowing\" dynamical 3-space being overlooked.

Measurements using bispectrum of cosmic microwave background\nanisotropies are limited by the cosmic variance, i.e. available number of\nmodes. Recent work has emphasized the possibility to probe non-gaussianity of\nlocal type using the scale dependence of large scale bias from highly biased\ntracers of large scale structure. However, this power spectrum method is also\nlimited by cosmic variance, finite number of structures on the largest scales,\nand by the partial degeneracy with other cosmological parameters that can mimic\nthe same effect. Here we propose an alternative method that solves both of\nthese problems. It is based on the idea that on large scales halos are biased,\nbut not stochastic, tracers of dark matter: by correlating a highly biased\ntracer of large scale structure against an unbiased tracer one eliminates the\ncosmic variance error, which can lead to a high signal to noise even from the\nstructures comparable to the size of the survey. The square of error\nimprovement on non-gaussianity parameter f_nl relative to the power spectrum\nmethod scales as Pn/2, where P and n is the power spectrum and the number\ndensity of the biased tracer, respectively. For an ideal survey out to z=2 the\nerror reduction can be as large as a factor of seven, which should guarantee a\ndetection of non-gaussianity from an all sky survey of this type. The\nimprovements could be even larger if high density tracers that are sensitive to\nnon-gaussianity can be identified and measured over a large volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2008 05:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-23"}

They examine four distinct periods in economic\nhistory, and conclude that there is a secular trend towards greater\nsynchronisation for much of the 20th century. Their analysis, in common with\nthe standard economic literature on business cycle synchronisation, relies upon\nthe estimation of an empirical correlation matrix of time series data of\nmacroeconomic aggregates. However because of the small number of observations\nand economies, the empirical correlation matrix may contain considerable noise.\nRandom matrix theory was developed to overcome this problem. I use random\nmatrix theory, and the associated technique of agglomerative hierarchical\nclustering, to examine the evolution of business cycle synchronisation between\nthe capitalist economies in the long-run. Contrary to the findings of Bordo and\nHelbing, it is not possible to speak of a 'secular trend' towards greater\nsynchronisation over the period as a whole. During the pre-First World War\nperiod, the cross-country correlations of annual real GDP growth are\nindistinguishable from those which could be generated by a purely random\nmatrix. The periods 1920-38 and 1948-72 do show a certain degree of\nsynchronisation, but it is very weak. In particular, the cycles of the major\neconomies cannot be said to be synchronised. Such synchronisation as exists in\nthe overall data is due to meaningful co-movements in sub-groups. So the degree\nof synchronisation has evolved fitfully. It is only in the most recent\n1973-2006 period that we can speak meaningfully of anything resembling an\ninternational business cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2008 12:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

Specifically, a network is studied in which receivers apply\nzero-forcing beamforming to cancel the strongest interferers. Assuming a\nnetwork with Poisson distributed transmitters and independent Rayleigh fading\nchannels, the transmission capacity is derived, which gives the maximum number\nof successful transmissions per unit area. Mathematical tools from stochastic\ngeometry are applied to obtain the asymptotic transmission capacity scaling and\ncharacterize the impact of inaccurate channel state information (CSI). It is\nshown that, if each node cancels L interferers, the transmission capacity\ndecreases as the outage probability to the power of 1/(L+1) as the outage\nprobability vanishes. For fixed outage probability, as L grows, the\ntransmission capacity increases as L to the power of (1-2/alpha) where alpha is\nthe path-loss exponent. Moreover, CSI inaccuracy is shown to have no effect on\nthe transmission capacity scaling as the outage probability vanishes, provided\nthat the CSI training sequence has an appropriate length, which we derived.\nNumerical results suggest that canceling merely one interferer by each node\nincreases the transmission capacity by an order of magnitude or more, even when\nthe CSI is imperfect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2008 04:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 07:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

The brightness temperature at the jet base is in excess of\n6e10 K. We find evidence of limb brightening on physical scales from <1 pc to\n~40 pc. Polarization images and fits to the trend of jet width and brightness\nvs. distance from the core reveal a magnetic field parallel to the jet axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2008 07:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The disc\nwarping also provides a solution for the energy budget in the emission line\nregion because it increases the solid angle of the outer disc portion subtended\nto the inner portion of the disc.

In\nother words, if the partial transpose is not positive semidefinite and so one\nor more of its eigenvalues are negative then the state represented by the\ncorresponding density matrix is entangled.

For macroscopic black hole ground state is practically\ntotally occupied while other states are practically totally unoccupied which is\na typical Bose condensation.

We extend the discussion of the implementation of the\nGauss--Seidel algorithm in spherical geometry and include the case of hyperfine\nline overlap. We first review the basics of the short characteristics method\nthat is used to solve the radiative transfer equations. Details are given on\nthe determination of the Lambda operator in spherical geometry. The\nGauss--Seidel algorithm is then described and, by analogy to the plan--parallel\ncase, we see how to introduce it in spherical geometry. Doing so requires some\napproximations in order to keep the algorithm competitive. Finally, line\noverlap effects are included. The convergence speed of the algorithm is\ncompared to the usual Jacobi iterative schemes. The gain in the number of\niterations is typically factors of 2 and 4 for the two implementations made of\nthe Gauss--Seidel algorithm. This is obtained despite the introduction of\napproximations in the algorithm.

Low-field magnetization measurements\nand band structure calculations show that Ag(2)VOP(2)O(7) is close to the dimer\nlimit with the largest nearest-neighbor interaction of about 30 K. High-field\nmagnetization data reveal the critical fields \\mu_0H_{c1} of about 23 T\n(closing of the spin gap) and \\mu_0H_{c2} of about 30 T (saturation by full\nalignment of the magnetic moments). From H_{c1} to H_{c2} the magnetization\nincreases sharply similar to the system of isolated dimers. Thus, the magnetic\nfrustration in Ag(2)VOP(2)O(7) bears little influence on the high-field\nproperties of this compound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2008 13:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We have studied the $3s3p$\n$^1$P$_1 \\leftarrow 3s^2$ $^1$S$_0$ transition of the dopant, and have compared\nour results with experimental data from laser induced fluorescence (LIF). Line\nbroadening effects due to the coupling of dynamical deformations of the\nsurrounding helium with the dipole excitation of the impurity are explicitly\ntaken into account. We show that the Mg radial delocalization inside large\ndroplets may help reconcile the apparently contradictory solvation properties\nof magnesium as provided by LIF and electron-impact ionization experiments.

This analysis\nis carried out using High Frequency PIV (HFPIV) measurements in a reactive\nsituation. While this information is usually available at a rather low rate,\ntemporally resolved PIV measurements are necessary to better understand highly\nturbulent swirled flows, which are unsteady by nature. Thanks to recent\ntechnical improvements, a PIV system working at 12 kHz has been developed to\nstudy this experimental combustor flow field. Statistical quantities of the\nburner are first obtained and analyzed, and the measurement quality is checked,\nthen a temporal analysis of the velocity field is carried out, indicating that\nlarge coherent structures periodically appear in the combustion chamber. The\nfrequency of these structures is very close to the quarter wave mode of the\nchamber, giving a possible explanation for combustion instability coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2008 15:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-14"}

By using a variational approach, here we show that the\npresence of the cluster glass state is actually an inherent nature of the model\nbased on the antiferromagnetic interaction (J) only, i.e. the well known t-J\nmodel. There is no need yet to introduce a competing interaction to understand\nthe existence of the cluster glass state. The long-range pairing correlation is\nnot much influenced by the disorder in the glass state which also has nodes and\nlinear density of states. In the antinodal region, the spectral weight is\nalmost completely suppressed. The modulation also produces subgap structures\ninside the \"coherent\" peaks of the local density of states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2008 15:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-31"}
