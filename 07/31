Bose\nEinstein condensates (BEC) are a natural example of analogue model since one\ncan identify matter propagating on a (pseudo-Riemannian) metric with collective\nexcitations above the condensate of atoms. However, until now, a description of\nthe \"analogue gravitational dynamics\" for such model was missing. We show here\nthat in a BEC system with massive quasi-particles, the gravitational dynamics\ncan be encoded in a modified (semi-classical) Poisson equation. In particular,\ngravity is of extreme short range (characterized by the healing length) and the\ncosmological constant appears from the non-condensed fraction of atoms in the\nquasi-particle vacuum. While some of these features make the analogue\ngravitational dynamics of our BEC system quite different from standard\nNewtonian gravity, we nonetheless show that it can be used to draw some\ninteresting lessons about \"emergent gravity\" scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2008 18:39:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 11:46:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-03"}

These are best studied in the observer planes, namely the\npeak energy E_peak_obs vs the fluence F or the peak flux P. In a recent paper\nwe started to attack this problem considering all GRBs with known z and\nspectral properties. Here we consider instead all bursts with known E_peak_obs,\nirrespective of z, adding to those a sample of 100 faint BATSE bursts\nrepresentative of a larger population. This allows us to construct a complete,\nfluence limited, sample, to study the selection/instrumental effects. We found\nthat fainter bursts have smaller E_peak_obs than those of bright events. As a\nconsequence, the E_peak_obs of these bursts is correlated with the fluence,\nthough with a slope flatter than that defined by bursts with z. Selection\neffects, which are present, are shown not to be responsible for the existence\nof such a correlation. About 6% of these bursts are surely outliers of the\nE_peak-E_iso correlation (updated to include 83 bursts), since they are\ninconsistent with it for any z. E_peak_obs correlates also with P, with a slope\nsimilar to the E_peak-L_iso correlation.In this case there is only one sure\noutlier.The scatter of the E_peak_obs-P correlation defined by the BATSE bursts\nof our sample is smaller than the E_peak_obs-F correlation of the same bursts,\nwhile for the bursts with known z the E_peak-E_iso correlation is tighter than\nthe E_peak-L_iso one. Once a very large number of bursts with E_peak_obs and z\nwill be available, we thus expect that the E_peak-L_iso correlation will be\nsimilar to that currently found, whereas it is likely that the E_peak-E_iso\ncorrelation will become flatter and with a larger scatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2008 20:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

On one hand, the\nhalo occupation statistics inferred from the observed clustering properties of\ngalaxies are degenerate with the adopted cosmology. Consequently, different\ncosmologies imply different mass-to-light ratios for dark matter haloes. On the\nother hand, galaxy-galaxy lensing yields direct constraints on the actual\nmass-to-light ratios and it can be used to break this degeneracy, and thus to\nconstrain cosmological parameters. In this paper we establish the link between\ngalaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass using the conditional luminosity\nfunction (CLF). We constrain the CLF parameters using the galaxy luminosity\nfunction and the luminosity dependence of the correlation lengths of galaxies.\nThe resulting CLF models are used to predict the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.\nFor a cosmology with $(\\Omega_{\\rm m},\\sigma_8)=(0.238,0.734)$, the model\naccurately fits the galaxy-galaxy lensing data obtained from the SDSS. For a\ncomparison cosmology with $(\\Omega_{\\rm m},\\sigma_8)=(0.3,0.9)$, however, we\ncan accurately fit the luminosity function and clustering properties of the\ngalaxy population, but the model predicts mass-to-light ratios that are too\nhigh, resulting in a strong overprediction of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.\nWe conclude that the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing\nis a powerful probe of the galaxy-dark matter connection, with the potential to\nyield tight constraints on cosmological parameters. Since this method mainly\nprobes the mass distribution on non-linear scales, it is complementary to\nconstraints obtained from the galaxy power-spectrum, which mainly probes the\nlarge-scale (linear) matter distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2008 20:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-19"}

It creates\ndifficulties with understanding of the Einstein relation between conductivity\nand diffusion coefficient. Using the expression for electrochemical potential\nthat takes into account the long range part of the Coulomb interaction it is\nshown that at negative density of states Einstein relation gives a negative\nsign of the diffusion coefficient D, but under this condition there is no\nthermodynamic limitation on the sign of D. It happens because the unipolar\nrelaxation of inhomogeneous electron density is not described by the diffusion\nequation. The relaxation goes much faster due to electric forces caused by\nelectron density and by neutralizing background. Diffusion coefficient is\nirrelevant in this case and it is not necessarily positive because process of\ndiffusion does not contribute to the positive production of entropy. In the\ncase of bipolar diffusion negative D results in a global absolute instability\nthat leads to formation of neutral excitons.

Given another\nagent statement about the continuous value of a variable $x$, we will see that\ninteresting dynamics emerge when an agent assigns a likelihood to that value\nthat is a mixture of a Gaussian and a Uniform distribution. This represents the\nidea the other agent might have no idea about what he is talking about. The\neffect of updating only the first moments of the distribution will be studied.\nand we will see that this generates results similar to those of the Bounded\nConfidence models. By also updating the second moment, several different\nopinions always survive in the long run. However, depending on the probability\nof error and initial uncertainty, those opinions might be clustered around a\ncentral value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2008 03:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-04"}

In particular, we characterize the first three\nleading terms in the asymptotic expression of the joint probability density\nfunction (p.d.f.) of the random shear tensor at a general point in the lens\nplane due to point masses in the limit of an infinite number of stars. Up to\nthis order, the p.d.f. depends on the magnitude of the shear tensor, the\noptical depth, and the mean number of stars through a combination of radial\nposition and the stars' masses. As a consequence, the p.d.f.s of the shear\ncomponents are seen to converge, in the limit of an infinite number of stars,\nto shifted Cauchy distributions, which shows that the shear components have\nheavy tails in that limit. The asymptotic p.d.f. of the shear magnitude in the\nlimit of an infinite number of stars is also presented. Extending to general\nrandom distributions of the lenses, we employ the Kac-Rice formula and Morse\ntheory to deduce general formulas for the expected total number of images and\nthe expected number of saddle images.

The difference between the old (revised\nbut not bias corrected) and the new (LK bias corrected) relations are almost\nnegligible in predicting the distances of W UMa stars up to about 100 parsecs.\nBut, it increases and may become intolerable as distances of stars increase.\nAdditionally, using $(J-H)_{0}$ and $(H-K_{s})_{0}$ colors from 2MASS (Two\nMicron All Sky Survey) data, a PLC relation working with infrared data was\nderived.

Despite {\\em 2MASS}\ndata are single epoch observations, which are not guaranteed at maximum\nbrightness of the W UMa stars, the established relation has been found\nsurprisingly consistent and reliable in predicting LK corrected distances of W\nUMa stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2008 06:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

As the\nmagnetic field increases, the system is transformed from the uniform superfluid\nstate to the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state, and finally to the spin\npolarized normal state. The second case may be relevant to cold fermionic\nsystems, where the numbers of fermions of each species are fixed as in a\ncanonical ensemble. In this case, the groundstate depends on the pairing\nstrength. For weak pairing, the order parameter exhibits a periodic domain wall\nlattice pattern with a localized spin distribution at low spin imbalance, and a\nsinusoidally modulated pattern with extended spin distribution at high spin\nimbalance.

The main contribution of this\npaper consists in showing that under standard assumptions ensuring incremental\nstability of a switched system (i.e. existence of a common Lyapunov function,\nor multiple Lyapunov functions with dwell time), it is possible to construct a\nfinite symbolic model that is approximately bisimilar to the original switched\nsystem with a precision that can be chosen a priori.

Even for a simple repressive\ntranscription factor that disturbs promoter activity at the initial binding of\nRNAP, its repression level is not determined solely by the dissociation\nconstant of transcription factor but is sensitive to the time scales of\nprocesses in RNAP. We first analyse the promoter activity under strong\nrepression by a slow binding repressor, in which case transcriptions occur in a\nburst, followed by a long quiescent period while a repressor binds to the\noperator; the number of transcriptions, the bursting and the quiescent times\nare estimated by reaction rates. We then examine interference effect from an\nopposing promoter, using the correlation function of transcription initiations\nfor a single promoter. The interference is shown to de-repress the promoter\nbecause RNAP's from the opposing promoter most likely encounter the repressor\nand remove it in case of strong repression. This de-repression mechanism should\nbe especially prominent for the promoters that facilitate fast formation of\nopen complex with the repressor whose binding rate is slower than about 1/sec.\nFinally, we discuss possibility of this mechanism for high activity of promoter\nPR in the hyp-mutant of lambda phage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2008 10:55:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2008 02:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Aug 2008 12:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Under the assumption that the\ntotal number of true particles vastly exceeds the number of representative\nparticles, the chance of a representative particle colliding with another\nrepresentative particle is negligibly small, and we therefore ignore this\npossibility. This now makes it possible to employ a statistical approach to the\nevolution of the representative particles.\n  Results: The method reproduces the known analytic solutions of simplified\ncoagulation kernels, and compares well to numerical results for Brownian motion\nusing other methods. For reasonably well-behaved kernels it produces good\nresults even for moderate number of swarms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2008 13:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The location of\nrecent X-ray and gamma-ray emission (N14 W61) was near to Sun-Earth connecting\nmagnetic field lines, thus providing the opportunity to directly observe the\nacceleration source from Earth. We restrict our analysis to protons of energy\ngreater than 450 MeV to avoid complications arising from transport processes\nthat can affect the propagation of low energy protons. In light of this revised\napproach we have reinvestigated two previous GLEs: those of 2000 July 14 (GLE\n59) and 2001 April 15 (GLE 60). Within the limitations of the spectral forms\nemployed, we find that from the peak (06:55 UT) to the decline (07:30 UT)\nphases of GLE 69, neutron monitor observations from 450 MeV to 10 GeV are best\nfitted by the Gallegos-Cruz & Perez-Peraza stochastic acceleration model. In\ncontrast, the Ellison & Ramaty spectra did not fit the neutron monitor\nobservations as well. This result suggests that for GLE 69, a stochastic\nprocess cannot be discounted as a mechanism for relativistic particle\nacceleration, particularly during the initial stages of this solar event. For\nGLE 59 we find evidence that more than one acceleration mechanism was present,\nconsistent with both shock and stochastic acceleration processes dominating at\ndifferent times of the event. For GLE 60 we find that Ellison & Ramaty spectra\nbetter represent the neutron monitor observations compared to stochastic\nacceleration spectra. The results for GLEs 59 and 60 are in agreement with our\nprevious work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2008 13:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Polar winds are\nexpected to be dominant for fast rotating hot stars.\n  These polar winds allow the star to lose large quantities of mass and still\nretain a high angular momentum, and they modifie the evolution of the surface\nvelocity and the final angular momentum kept in the star's core.

Correspondingly, the echo effects induced\nby an electron spin flip at time $\\tau$ exhibit stable recoherence pulse\nsequence for the periodic evolution and a single peak at $\\sqrt 2 \\tau$ for the\ndecoherence evolution, respectively.

The results reveal\nqualitatively different behaviors for high-angle grain boundaries that are\nuniformly wetted, with w diverging logarithmically as the melting point is\napproached from below, and low-angle boundaries that are punctuated by liquid\npools surrounding dislocations, separated by solid bridges.

In the latter case, V(w) has a minimum\nthat corresponds to a premelted boundary of finite width at the melting point.\nFurthermore, we find that the standard wetting condition (the grain boundary\nenergy is equal to twice the solid-liquid free energy) gives a much too low\nestimate of the critical misorientation when a low-temperature value of the\ngrain boundary energy is used.

First, we study the\nperformance of the classical loopy max-product belief propagation. We show that\neach fixed point estimate of max-product can be mapped in a natural way to an\nextreme point of the LP polytope associated with the MWIS problem. However,\nthis extreme point may not be the one that maximizes the value of node weights;\nthe particular extreme point at final convergence depends on the initialization\nof max-product. We then show that if max-product is started from the natural\ninitialization of uninformative messages, it always solves the correct LP -- if\nit converges. This result is obtained via a direct analysis of the iterative\nalgorithm, and cannot be obtained by looking only at fixed points.\n  The tightness of the LP relaxation is thus necessary for max-product\noptimality, but it is not sufficient. Motivated by this observation, we show\nthat a simple modification of max-product becomes gradient descent on (a\nconvexified version of) the dual of the LP, and converges to the dual optimum.\nWe also develop a message-passing algorithm that recovers the primal MWIS\nsolution from the output of the descent algorithm. We show that the MWIS\nestimate obtained using these two algorithms in conjunction is correct when the\ngraph is bipartite and the MWIS is unique.\n  Finally, we show that any problem of MAP estimation for probability\ndistributions over finite domains can be reduced to an MWIS problem. We believe\nthis reduction will yield new insights and algorithms for MAP estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2008 15:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

This new perspective has\n1:2 Mean Motion Resonance (1:2 MMR, that is Ps/Pj = 2) implicit in itself .\nThis paper has shown that if we assume the sequential birth of the planets with\nthe heaviest, i.e. Jupiter, being born the earliest and this axiom is central\nto the new perspective then there is an unique initial condition for which 1:2\nMMR crossing occurs exactly 300My after the birth of Jupiter. It is shown that\n25 My time gap between the birth of Jupiter and Saturn results in the 300 My\ntime delay in the occurrence of 1:2 MMR. Because the process by which Late\nHeavy Bombardment is triggered involves the movement of Neptune over enormous\ndistances hence almost 200 My time delay occurs between 1:2MMR crossing and the\nactual spike in the Meteoritic Shower on all the terrestrial planets as\nevidenced by the petrology record on the Moon. The analytical derivation of the\ntime delay in the spike is a vindication of this new perspective of the\napplication of planet-satellite dynamics to the birth and evolution of Solar\nSystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2008 15:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-01"}
