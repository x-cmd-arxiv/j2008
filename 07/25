In both series of compounds, the onset of superconductivity\nis associated with the suppression of magnetic order by doping holes and/or\nelectrons into the band leading to theories in which magnetic fluctuations are\neither responsible for or strongly coupled to the superconducting order\nparameter. In the cuprates, theories of magnetic pairing have been invoked to\nexplain the observation of a resonant magnetic excitation that scales in energy\nwith the superconducting energy gap and is suppressed above the superconducting\ntransition temperature, Tc. Such resonant excitations have been shown by\ninelastic neutron scattering to be a universal feature of the cuprate\nsuperconductors, and have even been observed in heavy fermion superconductors\nwith much lower transition temperatures. In this paper, we show neutron\nscattering evidence of a resonant excitation in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, which is a\nsuperconductor below 38K, at the momentum transfer associated with magnetic\norder in the undoped compound, BaFe2As2, and at an energy transfer that is\nconsistent with scaling in other strongly correlated electron superconductors.\nAs in the cuprates, the peak disappears at Tc providing the first experimental\nconfirmation of a strong coupling of the magnetic fluctuation spectrum to the\nsuperconducting order parameter in the new iron arsenide superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2008 17:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

Ten of these were spectroscopically\nconfirmed as V-type asteroids, suggesting that most of the candidates are\nbasaltic and can be used to constrain the distribution of basaltic material in\nthe Main Belt.\n  Using our catalog of V-type candidates and the success rate of the survey, we\ncalculate unbiased size-frequency and semi-major axis distributions of V-type\nasteroids. These distributions, in addition to an estimate for the total mass\nof basaltic material, suggest that Vesta was the predominant contributor to the\nbasaltic asteroid inventory of the Main Belt, however scattered planetesimals\nfrom the inner Solar System (a < 2.0 AU) and other partially/fully\ndifferentiated bodies likely contributed to this inventory. In particular, we\ninfer the presence of basaltic fragments in the vicinity of asteroid 15\nEunomia, which may be derived from a differentiated parent body in the middle\nMain Belt (2.5 < a < 2.8). We find no asteroidal evidence for a large number of\npreviously undiscovered basaltic asteroids, which agrees with previous theories\nsuggesting that basaltic fragments from the ~100 differentiated parent bodies\nrepresented in meteorite collections have been \"battered to bits\" [Burbine,\nT.H., Meibom, A., Binzel, R.P., 1996.

Recently, this\nwidely adopted distance has been challenged based on photometry of the presumed\ntip of the red giant branch (TRGB), which seems to yield a shorter distance of\n13.3+-1.0 Mpc and, with it, nearly 1 mag lower luminosities and smaller radii\nfor objects in this prototypical merger. Here we present a new distance\nestimate based on observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN) 2007sr in the\nsouthern tail, made at Las Campanas Observatory as part of the Carnegie\nSupernova Project. The resulting distance of D(SN Ia) = 22.3+-2.8 Mpc [(m-M)_0\n= 31.74+-0.27 mag] is in good agreement with a refined distance estimate based\non the recession velocity and the large-scale flow model developed by Tonry and\ncollaborators, D(flow) = 22.5+-2.8 Mpc. We point out three serious problems\nthat a short distance of 13.3 Mpc would entail, and trace the claimed short\ndistance to a likely misidentification of the TRGB. Reanalyzing Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) data in the Archive with an improved method, we find a TRGB\nfainter by 0.9 mag and derive from it a preliminary new TRGB distance of\nD(TRGB) = 20.0+-1.6 Mpc. Finally, assessing our three distance estimates we\nrecommend using a conservative, rounded value of D = 22+-3 Mpc as the best\ncurrently available distance to The Antennae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2008 20:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

This paper develops a conservative sequential test\nbased on the vote-counting errors found in a hand tally of a simple or\nstratified random sample of precincts. The procedure includes a natural\nescalation: If the hypothesis that the apparent outcome is incorrect is not\nrejected at stage $s$, more precincts are audited. Eventually, either the\nhypothesis is rejected--and the apparent outcome is confirmed--or all precincts\nhave been audited and the true outcome is known. The test uses a priori bounds\non the overstatement of the margin that could result from error in each\nprecinct. Such bounds can be derived from the reported counts in each precinct\nand upper bounds on the number of votes cast in each precinct. The test allows\nerrors in different precincts to be treated differently to reflect voting\ntechnology or precinct sizes. It is not optimal, but it is conservative: the\nchance of erroneously confirming the outcome of a contest if a full manual\nrecount would show a different outcome is no larger than the nominal\nsignificance level. The approach also gives a conservative $P$-value for the\nhypothesis that a full manual recount would find a different outcome, given the\nerrors found in a fixed size sample.

Research into classification of High\nDimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) data, in particular microarray data, has made\nconsiderable advances, but regression prediction for high-dimensional data with\ncontinuous responses has had less attention. Recently Bair et al (2006)\nproposed an efficient prediction method based on supervised principal component\nregression (PCR). Motivated by the fact that a larger number of principal\ncomponents results in better regression performance, this paper extends the\nmethod of Bair et al in several ways: a comprehensive variable ranking is\ncombined with a selection of the best number of components for PCR, and the new\nmethod further extends to regression with multivariate responses. The new\nmethod is particularly suited to HDLSS problems. Applications to simulated and\nreal data demonstrate the performance of the new method. Comparisons with Bair\net al (2006) show that for high-dimensional data in particular the new ranking\nresults in a smaller number of predictors and smaller errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 07:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-28"}

As a consequence of this\nevolution, the relations among various physical quantities of cosmic baryon\nfluid should be scale invariant, if the physical quantities are measured in\ncells on scales larger than the dissipation scale, regardless the baryon fluid\nis in virialized dark halo, or in pre-virialized state.

It was found that the\nonly unambiguous fingerprint in Raman spectroscopy to identify the number of\nlayers for graphene on SiC(0001) is the linewidth of the 2D (or D*) peak. The\nRaman spectra of epitaxial graphene show significant differences as compared to\nmicromechanically cleaved graphene obtained from highly oriented pyrolytic\ngraphite crystals. The G peak is found to be blue-shifted. The 2D peak does not\nexhibit any obvious shoulder structures but it is much broader and almost\nresembles a single-peak even for multilayers.

A comparison of the\nRaman data obtained for graphene on SiC with data for epitaxial graphene\ntransferred to SiO2 reveals that the G peak blue-shift is clearly due to the\nSiC substrate.

The camera optical design is a folded single\noptical train that images the sky onto the focal plane with a plate scale of\n0.45 arcsec per 18 micron pixel. A mosaic of four Hawaii 2RG of 2k x 2k made by\nTeledyne is used as detector and will give a field of view of 31.9 arcmin x\n31.9 arcmin. This cryogenic instrument has been optimized for the Y, J, H and K\nbands. Special care has been taken in the selection of the standard IR\nmaterials used for the optics in order to maximize the instrument throughput\nand to include the z band. The main challenges of this design are: to produce a\nwell defined internal pupil which allows reducing the thermal background by a\ncryogenic pupil stop; the correction of off-axis aberrations due to the large\nfield available; the correction of chromatic aberration because of the wide\nspectral coverage; and the capability of introduction of narrow band filters\n(~1%) in the system minimizing the degradation in the filter passband without a\ncollimated stage in the camera. We show the optomechanical error budget and\ncompensation strategy that allows our as built design to met the performances\nfrom an optical point of view. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of the\ndesign showing the performances of PANIC at the CAHA 3.5m telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 10:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The effectiveness\nof this process is determined by the 6D volume in phase space from which\nmolecules are accepted by the Stark decelerator. Couplings between the\nlongitudinal and transverse motion of the molecules in the decelerator can\nreduce this acceptance. These couplings are nearly absent when the decelerator\noperates such that only every third electric field stage is used for\ndeceleration, while extra transverse focusing is provided by the intermediate\nstages. For many applications, the acceptance of a Stark decelerator in this\nso-called $s=3$ mode significantly exceeds that of a decelerator in the\nconventionally used ($s=1$) mode. This has been experimentally verified by\npassing a beam of OH radicals through a 2.6 meter long Stark decelerator. The\nexperiments are in quantitative agreement with the results of trajectory\ncalculations, and can qualitatively be explained with a simple model for the 6D\nacceptance. These results imply that the 6D acceptance of a Stark decelerator\nin the $s=3$ mode of operation approaches the optimum value, i.e. the value\nthat is obtained when any couplings are neglected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 11:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the present paper we discuss the nature\nof Bochum 1, a typical example of an object affected by the above\nclassification problem.The field-decontaminated CMD of Bochum 1 presents main\nsequence (MS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. We report two new small\nangular-size, compact young clusters and one embedded cluster in the area of\nBochum 1. Vul OB1 harbours the young open cluster NGC 6823 and the very compact\nembedded cluster Cr 404. The Vul OB1 association includes the H II region\nSh2-86, and its stellar content is younger ($\\approx3$ Myr) than that of Bochum\n1 ($\\approx9$ Myr), which shows no gas emission. Bochum 1 harbours one of the\nnewly found compact clusters as its core. The RDP of Bochum 1 is irregular and\ncannot be fitted by a King-like profile, which suggests important erosion or\ndispersion of stars from a primordial cluster. Similarly to Bochum 1, the\ndecontaminated CMD of NGC 6823 presents conspicuous MS and PMS sequences. Taken\nseparately, RDPs of MS and PMS stars follow a King-like profile. The core shows\nan important excess density of MS stars that mimics the profile of a post-core\ncollapse cluster. At such young age, it can be explained by an excess of stars\nformed in the prominent core. The present study suggests that Bochum 1 is a\nstar cluster fossil remain that might be dynamically evolving into an OB\nassociation. Bochum 1 can be a missing link connecting early star cluster\ndissolution with the formation of low-mass OB associations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 11:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Using the ideas of that theory and much computer power\n(simulations), we have been able to come up with a reasonable answer to the\nquestion above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 13:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-28"}

While particle\nacceleration processes such as diffusive shock acceleration can accelerate ions\nand electrons, the accelerated electrons suffer larger radiative losses. Under\ncertain conditions, the ions can attain higher energies and reach farther ahead\nof the shock than the electrons, and so the nonthermal particles can be\npartially charge-separated. To compensate for the charge separation, the\nupstream plasma develops a return current, which, as it flows across the\nmagnetic field, drives transverse acceleration of the upstream plasma and a\ngrowth of density contrast in the shock upstream. If the density contrast is\nstrong by the time the fluid is shocked, vorticity is generated at the shock\ntransition. The resulting turbulence can amplify the post-shock magnetic field\nto the levels inferred from gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra and light curves.\nTherefore, since the upstream inhomogeneities are induced by the ions\naccelerated in the shock, they are generic even if the blastwave propagates\ninto a medium of uniform density. We speculate about the global structure of\nthe shock precursor, and delineate several distinct physical regimes that are\nclassified by an increasing distance from the shock and, correspondingly, a\ndecreasing density of nonthermal particles that reach that distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 15:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
