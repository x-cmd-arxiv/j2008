New VLA imaging at 1.4, 4.9, and 8.5 GHz reveals that GH 10's\nemission has an extent of less than 320 pc, has an optically-thin synchrotron\nspectrum with a spectral index -0.76+/-0.05, is less than 11 percent linearly\npolarized, and is steady - although poorly sampled - on timescales of weeks and\nyears.

The model describes a partially ionized magnetofluid interstellar\nmedium (ISM) that couples a neutral hydrogen fluid with a plasma primarily\nthrough charge exchange interactions. Charge exchange interactions are\nubiquitous in warm ISM plasma and the strength of the interaction depends\nlargely on the relative speed between the plasma and the neutral fluid. Unlike\nsmall length-scale linear collisional dissipation in a single fluid, charge\nexchange processes introduce channels that can be effective on a variety of\nlength-scales that depend on the neutral and plasma densities, temperature,\nrelative velocities, charge exchange cross section and the characteristic\nlength scales. We find, from scaling arguments and nonlinear coupled fluid\nsimulations, that charge exchange interactions modify spectral transfer\nassociated with large scale energy containing eddies. Consequently, the warm\nISM turbulent cascade rate prolongs spectral transfer amongst inertial range\nturbulent modes.

Although a wealth of diagnostic tools for\nconvergence assessment of MCMC methods have been proposed in the last two\ndecades, the search for a dependable and easy to implement tool is ongoing. We\npresent in this article a criterion based on the principle of detailed balance\nwhich provides a qualitative assessment of the convergence of a given chain.\nThe criterion is based on the behaviour of a one-dimensional statistic, whose\nasymptotic distribution under the assumption of stationarity is derived; our\nresults apply under weak conditions and have the advantage of being completely\nintuitive. We implement this criterion as a stopping rule for simulated\nannealing in the problem of finding maximum likelihood estimators for\nparameters of a 20-component mixture model. We also apply it to the problem of\nsampling from a 10-dimensional funnel distribution via slice sampling and the\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm. Furthermore, based on this convergence criterion\nwe define a measure of efficiency of one algorithm versus another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2008 11:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-22"}

This yields either a\nunitarily or an orthogonally invariant random-matrix model which is not of the\nCartan type. The average spectrum of the model is studied with the help of a\ngeneralized Pastur equation. Two independent parameters govern the behaviour of\nthe system: The strength $\\alpha^2$ of the coupling between positive- and\nnegative-energy states and the distance between the origin and the centers of\nthe two semicircles that describe the average spectrum for $\\alpha^2 = 0$, the\nlatter measured in units of the equal radii of the two semicircles. With\nincreasing $\\alpha^2$, positive- and negative-energy states become mixed and\never more of the spectral strength of the positive-energy states is transferred\nto those at negative energy, and vice versa. The two semicircles are deformed\nand pulled toward each other. As they begin to overlap, the RPA equations yield\nnon--real eigenvalues: The system becomes unstable. We determine analytically\nthe critical value of the strength for the instability to occur. Several\nfeatures of the model are illustrated numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2008 13:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Oct 2008 20:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-05"}

In the real\ncase, simple estimates of a_A are shown to be in partial agreement with\nreported acceleration anomalies from several Earth flybys and from the Pioneer\nspacecraft. However, these estimates do not fully reconcile with radio Doppler\ntracking data. The virtual case, by contrast, appears to overcome these and\nother difficulties with the real case, and is discussed in an addendum.\nFurthermore, the virtual case has an altitude dependence which makes detection\nof any anomaly unlikely above ~2000 km.

We construct the relevant low-energy effective Lagrangian where\nthese effects are dominated by dimension six operators, suppressed by the scale\nM of new physics. All the flavour breaking effects are universally described by\nthe vacuum expectation values <Phi> of a set of spurions. We separately analyze\nboth a supersymmetric and a general case. While the observed discrepancy delta\na_mu in the anomalous MDM of the muon suggests M of order of a few TeV, several\ndata require M above 10 TeV, in particular the limit on EDM of the electron. In\nthe general case also the present limit on BR(mu -> e gamma) requires M >10\nTeV, at least. The branching ratios for mu -> e gamma, tau -> mu gamma and tau\n-> e gamma are all expected to be of the same order. In the supersymmetric case\nthe constraint from mu -> e gamma is softened and it can be satisfied by a\nsmaller scale M. In this case both the observed delta a_mu and the current\nbound on BR(mu -> e gamma) can be satisfied, at the price of a rather small\nvalue for |<Phi>|, of the order of a few percents, that reflects on a similar\nvalue for theta_{13}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2008 14:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
