Here we investigate how systemic\nproper motion, which steadily re-orients planetary orbit with respect to our\nline of sight, affects the timing of transits. We find that in a typical system\nwith a period of several days proper motion at the level of 100 mas/yr makes\ntransit duration vary at a rate ~10-100 ms/yr. In some isolated systems this\nvariation is at the measurable level (can be as high as 0.6 s/yr for GJ436) and\nmay exceed all other transit timing contributions (due to the general\nrelativity, stellar quadrupole, etc.). In addition, proper motion causes\nevolution of the observed orbital period via the Shklovskii effect at a rate\n$\\gtrsim 10$ $\\mu$s/yr for the nearby transiting systems (0.26 ms/yr in GJ436),\nwhich in some cases exceeds all other contributions to $\\dot P$. Earth's motion\naround the Sun gives rise to additional periodic timing signal (even for\nsystems with zero intrinsic proper motion) allowing a full determination of the\nspatial orientation of the planetary orbit. Unlike most other timing effects\nthe proper motion signatures persist even in systems with zero eccentricity and\nget stronger as the planetary period increases. They should be the dominant\ncause of transit timing variations in isolated wide separation (periods of\nmonths) systems that will be sought by Kepler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2008 17:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

The main\nfocus is on applying the detection methods to wide field supernova imaging\nsurveys and in particular to the Stockholm VIMOS Supernova Survey (SVISS). We\nhave constructed a supernova detection pipeline for imaging surveys. The core\nof the pipeline is image subtraction using the ISIS 2.2 package. Using real\ndata from the SVISS we simulate supernovae in the images, both inside and\noutside galaxies. The detection pipeline is then run on the simulated frames\nand the effects of image quality and subtraction parameters on the detection\nefficiency and photometric accuracy are studied. The pipeline allows efficient\ndetection of faint supernovae in the deep imaging data. It also allows\ncontrolling and correcting for possible systematic effects in the SN detection\nand photometry. We find such a systematic effect in the form of a small\nsystematic flux offset remaining at the positions of galaxies in the subtracted\nframes. This offset will not only affect the photometric accuracy of the\nsurvey, but also the detection efficiencies. Our study has shown that ISIS 2.2\nworks well for the SVISS data. We have found that the detection efficiency and\nphotometric accuracy of the survey are affected by the stamp selection for the\nimage subtraction and by host galaxy brightness. With our tools the subtraction\nresults can be further optimised, any systematic effects can be controlled and\nphotometric errors estimated, which is very important for the SVISS, as well as\nfor future SN searches based on large imaging surveys such as Pan-STARRS and\nLSST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2008 16:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The linearity of a QA and of the partial trace super-operator,\ncombined with the properties of invariant subspaces under unitary\ntransformations, are used to minimize the dimension of the automaton and,\nconsequently, the number of its working qubits. The results here developed are\nvalid wether the state set of the QA is finite or not. There are two main\nresults in this paper: 1) We show that the dimension reduction is possible\nwhenever the unitary transformations, associated to each letter of the input\nalphabet, obey a set of conditions. 2) We develop an algorithm to find out the\nequivalent minimal QA and prove that its complexity is polynomial in its\ndimension and in the size of the input alphabet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2008 16:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

These objects exhibit\nfeatureless variability on different timescales, probably originating from an\naccretion disc. We study the basic features of the power spectra in terms of a\ngeneral framework, which permits semi-analytical determination of the power\nspectral density (PSD) of the resulting light curve. We consider the expected\nsignal generated by an ensemble of spots randomly created on the accretion disc\nsurface. Spot generation is governed by Poisson or by Hawkes processes. We\ninclude general relativity effects shaping the signal on its propagation to a\ndistant observer. We analyse the PSD of a spotted disc light curve and show the\naccuracy of our semi-analytical approach by comparing the obtained PSD with the\nresults of Monte Carlo simulations. The asymptotic slopes of PSD are 0 at low\nfrequencies and they drop to -2 at high frequencies, usually with a single\nfrequency break. More complex two-peak solutions also occur. The amplitude of\nthe peaks and their frequency difference depend on the inherent timescales of\nthe model. At intermediate frequencies, the intrinsic PSD is influenced by the\nindividual light curve profile as well as by the type of the underlying\nprocess. However, even in cases when two Lorentzians seem to dominate the PSD,\nit does not necessarily imply that two single oscillation mechanisms operate\nsimultaneously. Instead, it may well be the manifestation of the avalanche\nmechanism. The main advantage of our approach is an insight in the model\nfunctioning and the fast evaluation of the PSD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2008 20:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-11"}

The detection of a halo along\nthe minor axis of an edge-on galaxy in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field can largely\nbe explained by scattered galaxy light.

We find that the Fe ii absorption arises from a region with roughly\nconstant conditions and temperature greater than 9000 K, before the ionization\nfront where temperature and electron density drop. Further, we model the\nobserved spectra and investigate the effects of varying gas metalicities and\nthe spectral energy distribution of the incident ionizing radiation field. The\naccurately measured column densities allow us to determine the ionization\nparameter log(U) = -2.4 and total column density of the outflow (log(N_H) =\n20.6 cm^-2). Combined with the number density finding, these are stepping\nstones towards determining the mass flux and kinetic luminosity of the outflow,\nand therefore its importance to AGN feedback processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2008 20:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 17:07:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2008 21:23:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2008 13:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

From first principles, we initiate the development of a mathematical\ntheory of stochastic microlensing. Beginning with the random time delay\nfunction and associated lensing map, we determine exact expressions for the\nmean and variance of these transformations. We characterize the exact p.d.f. of\na normalized random time delay function at the origin, showing that it is a\nshifted gamma distribution, which also holds at leading order in the limit of a\nlarge number of point masses at a general point of the lens plane. For the\nlarge number of point masses limit, we also prove that the asymptotic p.d.f. of\nthe random lensing map under a specified scaling converges to a bivariate\nnormal distribution. We show analytically that the p.d.f. of the random scaled\nlensing map at leading order depends on the magnitude of the scaled bending\nangle due purely to point masses as well as demonstrate explicitly how this\nradial symmetry is broken at the next order. Interestingly, we found at leading\norder a formula linking the expectation and variance of the normalized random\ntime delay function to the first Betti number of its domain. We also determine\nan asymptotic p.d.f. for the random bending angle vector and find an integral\nexpression for the probability of a lens plane point being near a fixed point.\nLastly, we show explicitly how the results are affected by location in the lens\nplane.

Our intuitive\nmethods of always picturing one-dimensional space as a sum of unit-length rods\nand of picturing one-dimensional time as consecutive ticks of a clock suggest\nsubconsciously that changes in space never alter time and vice versa. In this\npaper, we present a compiled list of popular arguments against Special\nRelativity, and we show how our erroneous intuitive conviction that the\ndefinition of space is always independent of the definition of time and vice\nversa is indeed the driving force behind these arguments. Once interdependence\nbetween space and time is established within their respective definitions, it\nis shown how such arguments are quickly resolved. Interdependence between space\nand time is described in two different ways, which are mathematically different\nbut physically equivalent. We show how by assuming a time-independent\nmeasurement tool for space, time should be defined in terms of space to reflect\ntheir interdependence and this yields Lorentz Transformation. If we assume a\nspace-independent measurement tool for time, space should be defined in terms\nof time, and this yields a different set of equations. Next, it is shown how\nthe two different faces of the coin of Special Relativity, while mathematically\ndifferent, are essentially equivalent from a physical point of view, and that\nboth yield the same laws of addition of velocity, length contraction and time\ndilation effects. The apparent differences in physical interpretations between\nthe two sets of equations are attributed to the differences in the definitions\nof space and time used in both cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2008 11:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-03"}

We find that when\nvolatility affects mostly the decay of links, the model exhibit a sharp\ntransition between an ordered phase with a dense network and a disordered phase\nwith a sparse network. When volatility is mostly node-based, instead, only the\nsymmetric (disordered) phase exists These two regimes are separated by a second\norder phase transition of unusual type, characterized by an order parameter\ncritical exponent $\\beta=0^+$.

AQC initial Hamiltonians conventionally have a uniform superposition\nas ground state. We diverge from this practice by introducing a simple form of\nheuristics: the ability to start the quantum evolution with a state which is a\nguess to the solution of the problem. With this goal in mind, we explain the\nviability of this approach and the needed modifications to the conventional AQC\n(CAQC) algorithm. By performing a numerical study on hard-to-satisfy 6 and 7\nbit random instances of the satisfiability problem (3-SAT), we show how this\nheuristic approach is possible and we identify that the performance of the\nparticular algorithm proposed is largely determined by the Hamming distance of\nthe chosen initial guess state with respect to the solution. Besides the\npossibility of introducing educated guesses as initial states, the new strategy\nallows for the possibility of restarting a failed adiabatic process from the\nmeasured excited state as opposed to restarting from the full superposition of\nstates as in CAQC. The outcome of the measurement can be used as a more refined\nguess state to restart the adiabatic evolution.

Ab initio calculations support the correctness of\nthe shock data. In a very recent letter, Belonoshko et al. propose a simple and\nelegant resolution of this conflict for molybdenum. Using ab initio\ncalculations based on density functional theory (DFT), they show that the\nhigh-P/high-T phase diagram of Mo must be more complex than was hitherto\nthought. Their calculations give convincing evidence that there is a transition\nboundary between the normal bcc structure of Mo and a high-T phase, which they\nsuggest could be fcc. They propose that this transition was misinterpreted as\nmelting in DAC experiments. In confirmation, they note that their boundary also\nexplains a transition seen in the SW data. We regard Belonoshko et al.'s Letter\nas extremely important, but we note that it raises some puzzling questions, and\nwe believe that their proposed phase diagram cannot be completely correct. We\nhave calculated the Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies of the bcc, fcc and hcp\nphases of Mo, using essentially the same quasiharmonic methods as used by\nBelonoshko et al.; we find that at high-P and T Mo in the hcp structure is more\nstable than in bcc or fcc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2008 15:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
