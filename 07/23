We\ndemonstrate that strong gas inflows produce nuclear disks at the centers of\nmerger remnants whose properties depend sensitively on the details of gas\nthermodynamics. In numerical simulations with parsec-scale spatial resolution\nin the gas component and an effective equation of state appropriate for a\nstarburst galaxy, we show that a SMBH binary forms very rapidly, less than a\nmillion years after the merger of the two galaxies. Binary formation is\nsignificantly suppressed in the presence of a strong heating source such as\nradiative feedback by the accreting SMBHs. We also present preliminary results\nof numerical simulations with ultra-high spatial resolution of 0.1 pc in the\ngas component. These simulations resolve the internal structure of the\nresulting nuclear disk down to parsec scales and demonstrate the formation of a\ncentral massive object (~ 10^8 Mo) by efficient angular momentum transport.\nThis is the first time that a radial gas inflow is shown to extend to parsec\nscales as a result of the dynamics and hydrodynamics involved in a galaxy\nmerger, and has important implications for the fueling of SMBHs. Due to the\nrapid formation of the central clump, the density of the nuclear disk decreases\nsignificantly in its outer region, reducing dramatically the effect of\ndynamical friction and leading to the stalling of the two SMBHs at a separation\nof ~1 pc. We discuss how the orbital decay of the black holes might continue in\na more realistic model which incorporates star formation and the multi-phase\nnature of the ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2008 19:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-23"}

This campaign detected new outbursts of five known X-ray transients\nand discovered two new systems. Their 2-10 keV peak luminosities range from\n1E34 to 6E36 erg/s. Two of the sources discussed in this paper are confirmed\nneutron star systems (AX J1745.6-2901 and GRS 1741-2853), while the five others\nhave an unknown nature. We discuss the characteristics of the observed\noutbursts and the duty cycles of the various systems. Several of the detected\ntransients seem to undergo enhanced X-ray activity with levels intermediate\nbetween quiescence and full outburst. We discuss the possibility that the\nsubluminous appearance of the eclipsing X-ray burster AX J1745.6-2901 is due to\nline-of-sight effects. We detected two type-I X-ray bursts with a duration of\n50-60 seconds from AX J1745.6-2901, which we discuss in view of the bursting\nbehavior of low-luminosity X-ray transients. Assuming that we are dealing with\naccreting neutron stars and black holes, we estimate the time-average accretion\nrate, Mdot, of the transients, which is an important input parameter for binary\nevolution models that attempt to explain the nature of subluminous X-ray\ntransients. Our estimates lie in the range of 3E-13 Msun/yr < Mdot < 1E-10\nMsun/yr, if the systems are neutron star X-ray binaries and between 4E-14\nMsun/yr < Mdot < 2E-11 Msun/yr for a scenario where the accreting object is a\nblack hole. Some of the systems have such low estimated mass-accretion rates\nthat they possibly pose a challenge for binary evolution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2008 16:31:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2009 21:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The threshold behavior and dynamic behavior of radial transport is\nrelated to flow penetration and the degree of spatial overlap between the flow\nshear and density gradient profiles. An investigation of the changes in\nturbulence and turbulent particle transport associated with the confinement\ntransition is presented. Two-dimensional cross-correlation measurements show\nthat the spatial coherence of edge turbulence in LAPD changes significantly\nwith biasing.

We calculate the microscopic viscosity and\nresistivity of plasma in these discs, and discuss the implications for their\nglobal structure and evolution. In the neutrino-cooled innermost regions, the\nviscosity is provided mainly by mildly degenerate electrons, while the\nresistivity is modified from the Spitzer value due to the effects of both\nrelativity and degeneracy. The plasma behaves as an almost ideal MHD fluid.\nAmong the non-ideal MHD effects the Hall term is relatively the most important,\nwhile the magnetic Prandtl number, Pr (the ratio of viscosity to resistivity),\nis typically larger than unity: 10 < Pr < 6000. The outer radiatively\ninefficient regions also display high Pr. Numerical simulations of the\nmagneto-rotational instability indicate that the saturation level and angular\nmomentum transport efficiency may be greatly enhanced at high Pr. If this\nbehaviour persists in the presence of a strong Hall effect we would expect that\nhyper-accreting discs should be strongly magnetised and highly variable. The\nexpulsion of magnetic field that cannot be dissipated at small scales may also\nfavour a magnetic outflow. We note the similaries between the Prandtl number in\nhyper-accreting discs and X-ray binary discs, which suggests that a comparison\nbetween late-time activity in GRBs and X-ray binary accretion states may be\nfruitful.

The existence of low metallicity stellar\npopulations could manifest itself through special characteristics of the\nimmediate environment of the GRB site in the host galaxy. We analyse the strong\nemission lines from the sub-luminous host galaxy of GRB 980425, which showed\nthe first connection with a supernova explosion (SN 1998bw). The host has a\nsufficient size to allow detailed resolved spectroscopy of individual HII\nregions and to look for regions with special properties close to the the GRB\nsite. Using integral field spectroscopy with VIMOS we cover most of the high\nsurface brightness part of the host including the HII region where the\nsupernova and GRB occurred. The star formation rate, reddening, equivalent\nwidth and stellar mass in the GRB region is similar to other HII regions in the\nhost. Extreme values arise in the only region that shows emission lines from\nWolf-Rayet stars; a region that lies 800 pc in projection from the GRB site.\nStrong emission line diagnostics of all HII regions imply oxygen abundances\nbetween 0.3 and 0.8 solar with the lowest values arising in the WR and GRB\nregions. Comparing the measured emission line ratios for a sample of low\nredshift GRB hosts to theoretical models and to observations of field galaxies,\nwe find that GRBs arise in a range of metallicity environments while the\nregions are consistently very young. The similar line ratios of GRB hosts\ncompared to the WR region can arise in spatially unresolved galaxies with\nbright HII regions near the GRB location.

We pay a special\nattention to the the second pixelization because it might be a potential source\nof a systematic noise in a weak lensing analysis. In particular, it is found\nthat resampling with rotation induces artificial ellipticities in object shapes\nhaving a periodic concentric-circle-shaped pattern. Our major findings are as\nfollows. (1) Root-mean-square (RMS) of artificial ellipticities in object\nshapes induced by the first pixelization effect can be as large as RMS > 10^-2\nif a characteristic size of objects (e.g., the FWHM) is smaller than twice of\nthe pixel size. While for larger objects, it quickly becomes very small (RMS <\n10^-5). (2) The amplitude of the shape deformation induced by the second\npixelization effect depends on the object size. It also depends strongly on an\ninterpolation scheme adopted to carry out resampling and on the grid size of\nthe output pixels. The RMS of ellipticities in object shapes induced by the\nsecond pixelization effect can be suppressed to well below 10^{-2} if one\nadopts a proper interpolation scheme (implemented in popular image processing\nsoftwares).

Introducing an optical lattice depletes this\ncoherence. Consequently, novel vortex physics may emerge in an experiment on a\nharmonically trapped gas in the presence of a rotating optical lattice. The\nmost dramatic effects would occur in proximity to the Mott state, an\ninteraction dominated insulator with a fixed integer number of particles per\nsite. We model such a rotating gas, showing that the lattice-induced spatial\nprofile of the superfluid density drives a gross rearrangement of vortices. For\nexample, instead of the uniform vortex lattices commonly seen in experiments,\nwe find parameters for which the vortices all sit at a fixed distance from the\ncenter of the trap, forming a ring. Similarly, they can coalesce at the center,\nforming a giant vortex. We find that the properties of this system are\nhysteretic, even far from the Mott state. We explain this hysteresis in terms\nof vortex pinning, commensurability between vortex density and pinning site\ndensity, and energy barriers against changing the number of vortices.

Thousands of IRDCs have already been identified. To date, it has not\nbeen resolved whether IRDCs always show star formation activity and, if so, if\nmassive star formation (> 8 solar masses) is the rule or the exception in\nIRDCs. Previous analysis of sub-millimeter cores in the cloud MSXDC\nG048.65-00.29 (G48.65) indicates embedded star formation activity. To\ncharacterize this activity in detail, mid-infrared photometry (3-30 micron) has\nbeen obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. This paper analyzes the point\nsources seen in the 24 micron band, combined with counterparts or upper limits\nat shorter and longer wavelengths. Data points in wavelength bands ranging from\n1 up to 850 micron are used to compare each 24 micron source to a set of\nSpectral Energy Distributions of Young Stellar Object (YSO) models. By\nassessing the models that fit the data, an attempt is made to identify YSOs as\nsuch and determine their evolutionary stages and stellar masses. A total of 17\nsources are investigated, 13 of which are classified as YSOs, primarily - but\nnot exclusively - in an early embedded phase of star formation. The modeled\nmasses of the central stellar objects range from sub-solar to ~8 solar masses.\nEvery YSO is at less than 1 pc projected distance from its nearest YSO\nneighbor. We conclude that IRDC G48.65 is a region of active star formation. We\nfind YSOs in various evolutionary phases, indicating that the star formation in\nthis cloud is not an instantaneous process. The inferred masses of the central\nobjects suggest that this IRDC hosts only low to intermediate mass YSOs and\nnone with masses exceeding ~8 solar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2008 11:37:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2008 09:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-18"}

To study\ntheir efficiency and compare it to one of the deterministic solutions, one is\nled to compute certain quantities, namely the hitting times and the cover time.\nUntil now, only bounds on these quantities were defined. First, this paper\npresents two generalizations of the notions of hitting and cover times to\nweighted graphs. Indeed, the properties of random walks on symmetrically\nweighted graphs provide interesting results on random walk based distributed\nalgorithms, such as local load balancing. Both of these generalization are\nproposed to precisely represent the behaviour of these algorithms, and to take\ninto account what the weights represent. Then, we propose an algorithm to\ncompute the n^2 hitting times on a weighted graph of n vertices, which we\nimprove to obtain a O(n^3) complexity. This complexity is the lowest up to now.\nThis algorithm computes both of the generalizations that we propose for the\nhitting times on a weighted graph. Finally, we provide the first algorithm to\ncompute the cover time (in both senses) of a graph. We improve it to achieve a\ncomplexity of O(n^3 2^n). The algorithms that we present are all robust to a\ntopological change in a limited number of edges.

They may be\nstar-forming galaxies with hotter dust temperatures or they may have lower\nfar-infrared luminosities and larger contributions from obscured active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN). Here we present observations of three z~2 examples of\nthis population, which we term submm-faint radio galaxies (SFRGs) in CO(3-2)\nusing the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer to study their gas and dynamical\nproperties. We estimate the molecular gas mass in each of the three SFRGs\n(8.3x10^{9} M_odot, <5.6x10^{9} M_odot and 15.4x10^{9} M_odot, respectively)\nand, in the case of RG163655, a dynamical mass by measurement of the width of\nthe CO(3-2) line (8x10^{10} csc^2i M_odot). While these gas masses are\nsubstantial, on average they are 4x lower than submm-selected galaxies (SMGs).\nRadio-inferred star formation rates (<SFR_radio>=970 M_odot\\yr) suggest much\nhigher star-formation efficiencies than are found for SMGs, and shorter gas\ndepletion time scales (~11 Myr), much shorter than the time required to form\ntheir current stellar masses (~160 Myr; ~10^{11} M_odot). By contrast, SFRs may\nbe overestimated by factors of a few, bringing the efficiencies in line with\nthose typically measured for other ultraluminous star-forming galaxies and\nsuggesting SFRGs are more like ultraviolet- (UV-)selected star-forming galaxies\nwith enhanced radio emission. A tentative detection of \\rga at 350um suggests\nhotter dust temperatures -- and thus similar gas-to-dust mass fractions -- as\nthe SMGs. We conclude that SFRGs' radio luminosities are larger than would\nnaturally scale from local ULIRGs given their gas masses or gas fractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2008 15:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Results: The scale height of\nthe electron layer for our sample is 0.93+/-0.13 kpc and the midplane electron\ndensity is 0.023+/-0.004 cm^-3, in agreement with earlier results. The average\ndensity along the line of sight is <n_e> = 0.018+/-0.002 cm^-3 and nearly\nconstant. Since <n_e> = F_v N_c, an inverse relationship between F_v and N_c is\nexpected.

Generalised Casimirs constructed from the iterated commutator action\nof these enhanced symmetries resolve all the multiplicity labels of the bases\nof matrix operators which diagonalise the two-point function. For the case of U\n(N) gauge theory with a single complex matrix in the adjoint of the gauge group\nwe have a U(N)^{\\times 4} global symmetry of the scaling operator at zero\ncoupling. Different choices of commuting sets of Casimirs, for the case of a\ncomplex matrix, lead to the restricted Schur basis previously studied in\nconnection with string excitations of giant gravitons and the Brauer basis\nstudied in connection with brane-anti-brane systems. More generally these\nremarks can be extended to the diagonalisation for any global symmetry group G.\nSchur-Weyl duality plays a central role in connecting the enhanced symmetries\nand the diagonal bases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2008 15:11:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2008 14:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-30"}

To make this\nproblem tractable, we develop a semi-analytical stellar structure model that\nallows for physical understanding of these stars with unconventional\nparameters, as well as a means to survey the relevant parameter space. In this\nwork, the most important quantities that determine stellar properties -- and\nare allowed to vary -- are the gravitational constant $G$, the fine structure\nconstant $\\alpha$, and a composite parameter $C$ that determines nuclear\nreaction rates. Working within this model, we delineate the portion of\nparameter space that allows for the existence of stars. Our main finding is\nthat a sizable fraction of the parameter space (roughly one fourth) provides\nthe values necessary for stellar objects to operate through sustained nuclear\nfusion. As a result, the set of parameters necessary to support stars are not\nparticularly rare. In addition, we briefly consider the possibility that\nunconventional stars (e.g., black holes, dark matter stars) play the role\nfilled by stars in our universe and constrain the allowed parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2008 15:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

From this formulation we can generate optimized algorithms\nfor multiplication. For example, one of the proposed algorithms requires\napproximately half the number of coordinate-level multiplications at the\nexpense of extra coordinate-level additions. Our method is then applied to the\nfinite fields GF(q^m) to further reduce the number of operations.
