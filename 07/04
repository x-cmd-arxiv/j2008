While debris disks must contain solids in\na broad range of sizes - from big planetesimals down to tiny dust grains -\ndebris disk observations are only sensitive to the dust end of the size\ndistribution. Collisional models of debris disks are needed to \"climb up\" the\nladder of the collisional cascade, from dust towards parent bodies,\nrepresenting the main mass reservoir of the disks. We have used our collisional\ncode to generate five disks around a sun-like star, assuming planetesimal belts\nat 3, 10, 30, 100, and 200 AU with 10 times the Edgeworth-Kuiper-belt mass\ndensity, and to evolve them for 10 Gyr. Along with an appropriate scaling rule,\nthis effectively yields a three-parametric set of reference disks (initial\nmass, location of planetesimal belt, age). For all the disks, we have generated\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs), assuming homogeneous spherical\nastrosilicate dust grains. A comparison between generated and actually observed\nSEDs yields estimates of planetesimal properties (location, total mass etc.).\nAs a test and a first application of this approach, we have selected five disks\naround sun-like stars with well-known SEDs. In four cases, we have reproduced\nthe data with a linear combination of two disks from the grid (an \"asteroid\nbelt\" at 3 AU and an outer \"Kuiper belt\"); in one case a single, outer\ncomponent was sufficient. The outer components are compatible with \"large\nKuiper belts\" of 0.2-50 earth masses (in the bodies up to 100 km in size) with\nradii of 100-200 AU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 17:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

IC10 X-1 and\nNGC300 X-1 have similar X-ray properties, with luminosities ~10^38 erg/s, and\norbital periods ~30 hr. We investigate similarities between these two, as well\nas differences between them and the known Galactic BH binary systems. We have\nexamined XMM-Newton observations of NGC300 X-1 and IC10 X-1. We extracted\nlightcurves and spectra; power density spectra (PDS) were constructed from the\nlightcurves, and the X-ray emission spectra were modeled. Each source exhibits\nPDS that are characteristic of disc-accreting X-ray binaries (XBs) in the high\nstate. In this state, Galactic XBs with known BH primaries have soft, thermal\nemission; however the emission spectra of our targets are predominantly\nnon-thermal. Furthermore, the Observation 1 spectrum of NGC300 X-1 is\nstrikingly similar to that of IC10 X-1. The remarkable similarity between the\nbehaviour of NGC300 X-1 in Observation 1 and that of IC10 X-1 lends strong\nevidence for NGC300 X-1 being a (BH+WR) binary. The unusual spectra of NGC300\nX-1 and IC10 X-1 may be due to these systems existing in a persistently high\nstate, whereas all known BH LMXBs are transient. BH XBs in a persistent high\nstate could retain their corona, and hence exhibit a large non-thermal\ncomponent. LMC X-1 is a BH XB that has only been observed in the high state,\nand its spectrum is remarkably similar to those of our targets. We therefore\nclassify NGC300 X-1, IC10 X-1 and perhaps LMC X-1 as a new breed of BH XB,\ndefined by their persistently high accretion rates and consequent stable disc\nconfiguration and corona. This scenario may also explain the lack of\nultraluminous X-ray sources in the canonical soft state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 18:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We consider here a directed, generic\ngraph of arbitrary size mimicking real-life long-haul communication networks,\nand give the exact, analytical solution for the two-terminal reliability.

At the quantum level, the fact that all classical orbits\nare closed gives rise to degeneracies in the spectrum. It is well-known that\nthe spectrum of a charged particle in a constant magnetic field consists of\ninfinitely degenerate Landau levels. Just as for the $1/r$ and $r^2$\npotentials, one thus expects some hidden accidental symmetry, in this case with\ninfinite-dimensional representations. Indeed, the position of the center of the\ncyclotron circle plays the role of a Runge-Lenz vector. After identifying the\ncorresponding accidental symmetry algebra, we re-analyze the system in a finite\nperiodic volume. Interestingly, similar to the quantum mechanical breaking of\nCP invariance due to the $\\theta$-vacuum angle in non-Abelian gauge theories,\nquantum effects due to two self-adjoint extension parameters $\\theta_x$ and\n$\\theta_y$ explicitly break the continuous translation invariance of the\nclassical theory. This reduces the symmetry to a discrete magnetic translation\ngroup and leads to finite degeneracy. Similar to a particle moving on a cone, a\nparticle in a constant magnetic field shows a very peculiar realization of\naccidental symmetry in quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 19:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

We develop a\nCollaborative Virtual Queue to enable better optimization capabilities during\ncongested situations while taking into account the laissez-faire competitive\nenvironment. Results are evaluated using a departure system model, validated\nusing current statistics and previous studies. First, the Collaborative Virtual\nQueue enables keeping aircraft away from runway queues, which increases\nwheels-off time predictability. Second, holding aircraft enables last-minute\nintra-airline flight switching. This creates new optimization capabilities for\nairlines i.e. it gives airlines the flexibility to prioritize their flight\nsequence in real-time. These capabilities are illustrated by the trade-off\nbetween minimizing the average passenger waiting time and minimizing the level\nof unfairness between aircraft of the same airline. For instance, airlines\ncould choose to decrease by up to 15% their average passenger waiting time by\nprioritizing heavy planes over small planes when the taxiway system is\ncongested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 22:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-08"}

This belief is supported by the discovery that a\nnoiseless (pure) state quantum computer must generate a large amount of\nentanglement in order to offer any speed up over a classical computer. However,\ndeterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit (DQC1), which employs\nnoisy (mixed) states, is an efficient model that generates at most a marginal\namount of entanglement. Although this model cannot implement any arbitrary\nalgorithm it can efficiently solve a range of problems of significant\nimportance to the scientific community. Here we experimentally implement a\nfirst-order case of a key DQC1 algorithm and explicitly characterise the\nnon-classical correlations generated. Our results show that while there is no\nentanglement the algorithm does give rise to other non-classical correlations,\nwhich we quantify using the quantum discord - a stronger measure of\nnon-classical correlations that includes entanglement as a subset. Our results\nsuggest that discord could replace entanglement as a necessary resource for a\nquantum computational speed-up. Furthermore, DQC1 is far less resource\nintensive than universal quantum computing and our implementation in a scalable\narchitecture highlights the model as a practical short-term goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2008 01:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-16"}

We calculate the tidal evolution of hypothetical terrestrial\nplanets around low-mass stars and show that tides can evolve planets past the\ninner edge of the habitable zone, sometimes in less than 1 billion years. This\nmigration requires large eccentricities (>0.5) and low-mass stars (<0.35\nM_Sun).

Such tests are usually based on a comparison of\ntwo-point quantities such as autocorrelation and response functions. The\npresent work highlights a potential problem of the theory in the sense that it\nmay predict any type of two-point function. More specifically, it is argued\nthat for a given two-point correlator it is possible to construct a\nrepresentation of the generators which exactly reproduces this particular\ncorrelator. This observation calls for a critical examination of the predictive\ncontent of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2008 13:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-08"}

Recently published surface\nmagnetograms of BP Tau and V2129 Oph have shown, however, that their fields are\nmore complex. The magnetic field of V2129 Oph was found to be predominantly\noctupolar. For BP Tau the magnetic energy was shared mainly between the dipole\nand octupole field components, with the dipole component being almost four\ntimes as strong as that of V2129 Oph. From the published surface maps of the\nphotospheric magnetic fields we extrapolate the coronal fields of both stars,\nand compare the resulting field structures with that of a dipole. We consider\ndifferent models where the disc is truncated at, or well-within, the Keplerian\ncorotation radius. We find that although the structure of the surface magnetic\nfield is particularly complex for both stars, the geometry of the larger scale\nfield, along which accretion is occurring, is somewhat simpler. However, the\nlarger scale field is distorted close to the star by the stronger field\nregions, with the net effect being that the fractional open flux through the\nstellar surface is less than would be expected with a dipole magnetic field\nmodel. Finally, we estimate the disc truncation radius, assuming that this\noccurs where the magnetic torque from the stellar magnetosphere is comparable\nto the viscous torque in the disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2008 14:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Scaffold proteins assemble multiple proteins in a spatially localized\nsignaling complex and exert numerous physical effects on signaling pathways. To\nstudy these effects, we consider a minimal, three-state kinetic model of\nscaffold mediated kinase activation. We first introduce and apply a path\nsummation technique to obtain approximate solutions to a single molecule master\nequation that governs protein kinase activation. We then consider exact\nnumerical solutions. We comment on when this approximation is appropriate and\nthen use this analysis to illustrate the competition of processes occurring at\nmany time scales involved in signal transduction in the presence of a scaffold\nprotein. The findings are consistent with recent experiments and simulation\ndata. Our results provide a framework and offer a mechanism for understanding\nhow scaffold proteins can influence the shape of the waiting time distribution\nof kinase activation and effectively broaden the times over which protein\nkinases are activated in the course of cell signaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2008 15:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The XRB carries information on the\nspatial distribution and evolution of these sources. The goals of the paper\nare: 1. to determine the redshift distribution of the soft X-ray background\nphotons produced by all types of extragalactic sources, in order to relate\nfluctuations of the background to the large scale structures, 2. to determine\nthe redshift distribution of the soft XRB produced by AGN in order to calculate\nthe evolution of the AGN X-ray luminosity density. A set of major X-ray surveys\nis used to determine the redshift distributions of the X-ray sources selected\nat various flux levels. Simple analytic fits to the data allow us to determine\nthe smooth relationship between the redshift distribution and the source flux.\nThe redshift distribution of the integral XRB flux is obtained by averaging the\nfits over the source counts. It is shown that the distribution of extragalactic\nXRB photons in the 0.5-2 keV band is adequately represented by the function:\ndn/dlog z = 5.24 z^1.52 exp(-z/0.63). The huge voids postulated to explain the\ncold spots in the CMB maps create dips in the total XRB flux. However, the\nexpected magnitude of the effect is comparable to the fluctuation amplitude of\nthe XRB generated by the individual sources contributing to the background. The\ncosmic evolution of the AGN X-ray luminosity density up to redshift of ~5 is\ncalculated in an elegant and straightforward way. Systematic uncertainties of\nthe present method are assessed and shown to be small. At redshift greater than\none the present results could be compared directly with some recent estimates\nobtained in a standard way and the agreement between both methods is very good.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2008 15:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The traditional approach to study a distribution relies on\nlocating its mean point and finding the dispersion about that point. On a\ngeneral manifold however, even if two distributions are sufficiently\nconcentrated and have unique means, a comparison of their covariances is not\npossible due to the difference in local parametrizations. To circumvent the\nproblem we associate a covariance field with each distribution and compare them\nat common points by applying a similarity invariant function on their\nrepresenting matrices. In this way we are able to define distances between\ndistributions. We also propose new approach for interpolating discrete\ndistributions and derive some criteria that assure consistent results.

Carrying on a series of unitary transformations, we perturbatively\nderive a second-order effective Hamiltonian which, projected onto the\nantiferromagnetic electron ground state, describes the spin wave excitations,\nrenormalized by their interaction with correlated itinerant electrons. We\nnumerically study how the different parameters of the model influence the\nrenormalization of the magnons, yielding useful information for the analysis of\ninelastic neutron scattering experiments in antiferromagnetic heavy fermion\ncompounds.
