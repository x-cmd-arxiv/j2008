The metallicity distribution of stars in these\ndSphs is similar to the MW halo at the metal-poor end.

Many cores with various line widths exist in one\nclump, and the index of the line width-radius relationship of the cores and the\nparental clump differs from core to core in the clump. This indicates that the\ndegree of dissipation of the turbulent motion varies for each core in one\nclump. Although the mass of the cores increases with the line width, most cores\nare gravitationally bound by the external pressure. In addition, the line width\nand the external pressure of the cores tend to decrease with the distance from\nthe center of the clump, and these dependencies may be caused by the inner H2\ndensity structure of the clump that affects the physical properties of the\ncores. Moreover, the number density of the cores and the number density of\nyoung (proto)stars have a similar relationship to the average H2 density of the\nclumps. Thus, our findings suggest that the cluster is formed in the clump\nthrough the formation of such multiple cores, whose physical properties would\nhave been strongly related to the H2 density structure and the turbulent motion\nof the clump.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2008 18:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We provide an\nintroduction to explicit methods in the study of moduli spaces of quiver\nrepresentations and derived categories arising in toric geometry. The first\nmain goal is to present the noncommutative geometric approach to semiprojective\ntoric varieties via quivers. To achieve this, we use geometric invariant theory\nto construct both semiprojective toric varieties and moduli spaces of quiver\nrepresentations. The second main goal builds on the first by presenting an\nintroduction to explicit methods in derived categories of coherent sheaves in\ntoric geometry. We recall the notion of tilting bundles with examples, and\ndescribe the McKay correspondence as a derived equivalence in some detail\nfollowing Bridgeland, King and Reid. We also describe extensions of their\nresult beyond the $G$-Hilbert scheme to other fine moduli spaces of bound\nquiver representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2008 16:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-15"}

How LyC escapes from galactic environments, whether it induces\npositive or negative feedback on the local and global collapse of structures,\nand the role played by clumping, molecules, metallicity and dust are major\nunanswered theoretical questions, requiring observational constraint. Numerous\nintervening Lyman limit systems, which frustrate the detection of LyC from high\nz objects, thin below z ~ 3 where there are a few objects with apparently very\nhigh fesc. At low z there are only controversial detections and a handful of\nupper limits.

It can also calibrate LyC escape against\nLy-alpha escape, providing an essential tool to JWST for probing the beginnings\nof reionization. We present calculations showing the evolution of the\ncharacteristic apparent magnitude of star-forming galaxy luminosity functions\nat 900 A, as a function of redshift and assumed escape fraction to determine\nthe required aperture for detecting LyC.

These currents can be called chiral partners at the\nfundamental level. In a world where chiral symmetry was not broken, the\ncorresponding current-current correlators would show the same spectral\ninformation. In the real world chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. A\nprominent peak -- the rho-meson -- shows up in the vector spectrum (measured in\n(e^+ e^-)-collisions and tau-decays). On the other hand, in the axial-vector\nspectrum a broad bump appears -- the a_1-meson (also accessible in tau-decays).\nIt is tempting to call rho and a_1 chiral partners at the hadronic level.\nStrong indications are brought forward that these ``chiral partners'' do not\nonly differ in mass but even in their nature: The rho-meson appears dominantly\nas a quark-antiquark state with small modifications from an attractive\npion-pion interaction. The a_1-meson, on the other hand, can be understood as a\nmeson-molecule state mainly formed by the attractive interaction between pion\nand rho-meson. A key issue here is that the meson-meson interactions are fixed\nby chiral symmetry breaking. It is demonstrated that one can understand the\nvector and the axial-vector spectrum very well within this interpretation. It\nis also shown that the opposite cases, namely rho as a pion-pion molecule or\na_1 as a quark-antiquark state lead to less satisfying results.

It is argued\nthat the large width of the QGP bags not only explains the observed deficit in\nthe number of hadronic resonances, but also clarifies the reason why the heavy\nQGP bags cannot be directly observed as metastable states in a hadronic phase.\nThe model allows us to estimate the minimal value of the width of QGP bags from\na variety of the lattice QCD data and get that the minimal resonance width at\nzero temperature is about 600 MeV, whereas the minimal resonance width at the\nHagedorn temperature is about 2000 MeV. As shown these estimates are almost\ninsensitive to the number of the elementary degrees of freedom. The recent\nlattice QCD data are analyzed and it is found that besides sigma T**4 term the\nlattice QCD pressure contains T-linear and T**4 ln T terms in the range of\ntemperatures between 240 MeV and 420 MeV. The presence of the last term in the\npressure bears almost no effect on the width estimates. Our analysis shows that\nat hight temperatures the average mass and width of the QGP bags behave in\naccordance with the upper bound of the Regge trajectory asymptotics (the linear\nasymptotics), whereas at low temperatures they obey the lower bound of the\nRegge trajectory asymptotics (the square root one). Since the model explicitly\ncontains the Hagedorn mass spectrum, it allows us to remove an existing\ncontradiction between the finite number of hadronic Regge families and the\nHagedorn idea of the exponentially growing mass spectrum of hadronic bags.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2008 15:10:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 14:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-30"}

To accurately model the infrared spectrum we\nhave extended our Monte Carlo radiation transfer codes to include emission from\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and very small grains (VSG). We\ndo this using pre-computed PAH/VSG emissivity files for a wide range of values\nof the mean intensity of the exciting radiation field. When Monte Carlo energy\npackets are absorbed by PAHs/VSGs we reprocess them to other wavelengths by\nsampling from the emissivity files, thus simulating the absorption and\nre-emission process without reproducing lengthy computations of statistical\nequilibrium, excitation and de-excitation in the complex many level molecules.\nUsing emissivity lookup tables in our Monte Carlo codes gives the flexibility\nto use the latest grain physics calculations of PAH/VSG emissivity and opacity\nthat are being continually updated in the light of higher resolution infrared\nspectra. We find our approach gives a good representation of the observed PAH\nspectrum from the disk of Gomez's Hamburger. Our models also indicate the\nPAHs/VSGs in the disk have a larger scaleheight than larger radiative\nequilibrium grains, providing evidence for dust coagulation and settling to the\nmidplane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2008 15:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here we demonstrate that\nvortices can be imaged with a modern, commercial transmission electron\nmicroscope operating at 300 kV equipped with a field emission gun, Lorentz lens\nand a liquid helium cooled sample holder. We introduce superconductivity for\nnon-specialists and discuss techniques for simulating and optimising images of\nflux vortices. Sample preparation is discussed in detail as the requirement for\nsamples with very large (>10um), flat areas so that the image is not dominated\nby diffraction contrast is the main difficulty with the technique.

Five X-ray\nsources were found inside the cluster core radius, including the known\neclipsing binary millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J1953+1846A. The X-ray light\ncurve of the source coincident with this MSP shows marginal evidence for\nperiodicity at the binary period of 4.2 h. Its hard X-ray spectrum and\nluminosity resemble those of other eclipsing binary MSPs in 47 Tuc, suggesting\na similar shock origin of the X-ray emission. A further 24 X-ray sources were\nfound within the half-mass radius, reaching to a limiting luminosity of 1.5\n10^30 erg/s (0.3-8 keV). From a radial distribution analysis, we find that\n18+/-6 of these 29 sources are associated with M71, somewhat more than\npredicted, and that 11+/-6 are background sources, both galactic and\nextragalactic.
