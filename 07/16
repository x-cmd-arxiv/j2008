Nevertheless, our approach yields apparently superluminal propagation\nfor the case of frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR), that is, a\ntransmitted wave packet appears on the far side of the gap at the same time\nthat the corresponding incident packet crosses the front one. Thus, in this\nexample superluminality is just an illusion, being consistent with both\ncasuality and classical electrodynamics. We study the origin of the apparent\nsuperluminality in this case, which is inherent to light pulse propagation in\nfree space and does not depend on the particulars of light-matter interaction,\nand find that it is due to propagation from the lateral wings of the incident\npulse to the central part of the transmitted pulse.

We propose experiments to\ntest our explanation of superluminality using opaque screens to block part of\nthe wavefront, although we demonstrate that the propagation of smooth finite\npulses constrained to be made up completely of evanescent Fourier components is\nindistinguishable from truly superluminal propagation, i.e., it may be\ncompletely accounted for using an explicitely superluminal and acausal\npropagator as well as the causal subluminal one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2008 18:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-17"}

Although filtering of intrinsic\nquasar radiation through dense regions in the IGM does increase the mean excess\nenergy per HeII photo-ionisation, it also weakens the radiation intensity and\nlowers the photo-ionisation rate, preventing rapid heating over time intervals\nshorter than the local photo-ionisation timescale. Moreover, the hard photons\nresponsible for the strongest heating are more likely to deposit their energy\ninside dense clumps. The abundance of such clumps is, however, uncertain and\nmodel-dependent, leading to a fairly large uncertainty in the photo-heating\nrates. Nevertheless, although some of the IGM may be exposed to a hardened and\nweakened ionising background for long periods, most of the IGM must instead be\nreionised by the more abundant, softer photons and with accordingly modest\nheating rates (\\Delta T < 10^4 K).

The X-ray 2-10 keV flux is remarkably well\ncorrelated with the optical B, V and R bands, their fluctuations are almost\nsimultaneous with a delay consistent with 0 days and not larger than 4 days in\neither direction. The amplitude of variations shows an intriguing behaviour:\nrapid, large amplitude fluctuations over tens of days in the X-rays have only\nsmall counterparts in the optical bands, while the long-term trends over\nhundreds of days are stronger in the B band than in X-rays.

We interpret the variability and correlations, in the\noptically-thick accretion disc plus corona scenario, as the result of intrinsic\naccretion rate variations modulating both X-ray and optical emission, together\nwith reprocessing of X-rays by the accretion disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2008 12:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The primary new feature identified in the main disk body\nis a latitude-dependent radial epicyclic motion driven by pressure gradients\nattributable to the gravitomagnetic warping of the disk. The induced motion of\nthe gas is coherent over the scale of the entire disk and is fast enough that\nit could be observable in features such as relativistic iron lines. The\neccentricity of the associated fluid element trajectories increases with\ndecreasing radius, leading to a crowding of orbit trajectories near their\napocenters. This results in a local density enhancement akin to a compression.\nThese compressions are sufficiently strong to produce a pair of weak shocks in\nthe vicinity of the black hole. These shocks are roughly aligned with the\nline-of-nodes between the black-hole symmetry plane and disk midplane, with one\nshock above the line-of-nodes on one side of the black hole and the other below\non the opposite side. These shocks enhance angular momentum transport and\nenergy dissipation near the hole, forcing some material to plunge toward the\nblack hole from well outside the innermost stable circular orbit. A new,\nextended simulation, which was evolved for more than a full disk precession\nperiod, allows us to confirm that these shocks and the previously identified\n``plunging streams'' precess with the disk in such a way as to remain aligned\nrelative to the line-of-nodes, as expected based on our physical understanding\nof these phenomena.

Such auctions have typically used per-click bidding and pricing. We\npropose the use of hybrid auctions where an advertiser can make a\nper-impression as well as a per-click bid, and the auctioneer then chooses one\nof the two as the pricing mechanism. We assume that the advertiser and the\nauctioneer both have separate beliefs (called priors) on the click-probability\nof an advertisement. We first prove that the hybrid auction is truthful,\nassuming that the advertisers are risk-neutral. We then show that this auction\nis superior to the existing per-click auction in multiple ways: 1) It takes\ninto account the risk characteristics of the advertisers. 2) For obscure\nkeywords, the auctioneer is unlikely to have a very sharp prior on the\nclick-probabilities. In such situations, the hybrid auction can result in\nsignificantly higher revenue. 3) An advertiser who believes that its\nclick-probability is much higher than the auctioneer's estimate can use\nper-impression bids to correct the auctioneer's prior without incurring any\nextra cost. 4) The hybrid auction can allow the advertiser and auctioneer to\nimplement complex dynamic programming strategies.

This\npresumes some particular relationship between the charge and mass distribution,\na feature which cannot be checked experimentally. In this paper we give three\ndifferent kinds of arguments suggesting that, if assumed different points, the\ncentre of charge of an elementary spinning particle moves in a helical motion\nat the speed of light, and it thus satisfies, in general, a fourth order\ndifferential equation. If assumed a kind of rigid body structure, it is\nsufficient the description of the centre of charge to describe also the\nevolution of the centre of mass and the rotation of the body. This assumption\nof a separation betwen the centre of mass and centre of charge gives a\ncontribution to the spin of the system and also justifies the existence of a\nmagnetic moment produced by the relative motion of the centre of charge. This\ncorresponds to an improved model of a charged elementary particle, than the\npoint particle case. This means that a Lagrangian formalism for describing\nelementary spinning particles has to depend, at least, up to the acceleration\nof the position of the charge, to properly obtain fourth order dynamical\nequations. This result is compared with the description of a classical Dirac\nparticle obtained from a general Lagrangian formalism for describing spinning\nparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2008 08:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

When this parameter appears as a\ncoupling constant, these models can be understood as straight-line\ninterpolations between different Hamiltonians $H_{\\rm I}$ and $H_{\\rm F}$. For\nfinite-size realizations however, there will usually be a finite energy gap\nbetween ground and first excited state. By slowly changing the coupling\nconstant through the point with the minimum energy gap one thereby has an\nadiabatic algorithm that prepares the ground state of $H_{\\rm F}$ from the\nground state of $H_{\\rm I}$. The adiabatic theorem implies that in order to\nobtain a good preparation fidelity the runtime $\\tau$ should scale with the\ninverse energy gap and thereby also with the system size. In addition, for open\nquantum systems not only non-adiabatic but also thermal excitations are likely\nto occur. It is shown that -- using only local Hamiltonians -- for the 1d\nquantum Ising model and the cluster model in a transverse field the\nconventional straight line path can be replaced by a series of straight-line\ninterpolations, along which the fundamental energy gap is always greater than a\nconstant independent on the system size. The results are of interest for\nadiabatic quantum computation since strong similarities between adiabatic\nquantum algorithms and quantum phase transitions exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2008 08:40:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 07:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-24"}

Then we design a model selection procedure in view of\nselecting some $\\hat{m}$ among $\\mathcal{M}$ in such a way that the Kullback\nrisk of $(\\hat{s}_{\\hat{m}},\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\hat{m}})$ is as close as possible to\nthe minimum of the Kullback risks among the family of estimators\n$\\{(\\hat{s}_m,\\hat{\\sigma}_m), m\\in\\mathcal{M}\\}$. Then we derive uniform rates\nof convergence for the estimator $(\\hat{s}_{\\hat{m}},\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\hat{m}})$\nover H\\\"{o}lderian balls. Finally, we carry out a simulation study in order to\nillustrate the performances of our estimators in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2008 12:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2008 14:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-30"}

In particular, we are interested in\noptimality that is a convergence speed independent of the size of the involved\nmatrices. For elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs), a well known\noptimality result requires that the sum of the orders of the grid transfer\noperators is not lower than the order of the PDE to solve. Analogously, when\ndealing with MGMs for Toeplitz matrices in the literature an optimality\ncondition on the position and on the order of the zeros of the symbols of the\ngrid transfer operators has been found. In this work we show that in the case\nof elliptic PDEs with constant coefficients, the two different approaches lead\nto an equivalent condition. We argue that the analysis for Toeplitz matrices is\nan algebraic generalization of the LFA, which allows to deal not only with\ndifferential problems but also for instance with integral problems. The\nequivalence of the two approaches gives the possibility of using grid transfer\noperators with different orders also for MGMs for Toeplitz matrices.

The\nmeasured standard deviation of the night averaged Stokes Q/I and U/I parameters\nis 2.2x10^{-6}. We derive upper limits on the geometric albedo, A_G and\nplanetary radius using Monte Carlo multiple scattering simulations of a simple\nmodel atmosphere. We assume Rayleigh-like scattering (scaled by the maximum\npolarisation, p_m at 90 degrees) and pressure insensitive extinction.\nAtmospheres in which multiple scattering plays only a small role have an almost\nlinear relation between polarisation and A_G. In this case, the 4 sigma upper\nlimits is A_G<0.13(R/1.2 R_{Jup})^{-2}p_m^{-1} for 55 Cnc e. This suggests that\n55 Cnc e is relatively small and not a pure H-He planet.

This extends the similar\nupper limits reported previously for this planet to longer wavelengths. The\nlarger scatter in the tau Boo data may be due to the spot activity detected\nphotometrically by the MOST satellite.

This is accomplished by\ntraining the machine learning code Pico on the calculations of a multi-level\ncosmological recombination code which self-consistently includes several\nphysical processes that were neglected previously. After training, Rico is used\nto fit the free electron fraction as a function of the cosmological parameters.\nWhile, for example at low redshifts (z<~900), much of the net change in the\nionization fraction can be captured by lowering the hydrogen fudge factor in\nRecfast by about 3%, Rico provides a means of effectively using the accurate\nionization history of the full recombination code in the standard cosmological\nparameter estimation framework without the need to add new or refined fudge\nfactors or functions to a simple recombination model. Within the new approach\npresented here it is easy to update Rico whenever a more accurate full\nrecombination code becomes available. Once trained, Rico computes the\ncosmological ionization history with negligible fitting error in ~10\nmilliseconds, a speed-up of at least 10^6 over the full recombination code that\nwas used here. Also Rico is able to reproduce the ionization history of the\nfull code to a level well below 0.1%, thereby ensuring that the theoretical\npower spectra of CMB fluctuations can be computed to sufficient accuracy and\nspeed for analysis from upcoming CMB experiments like Planck. Furthermore it\nwill enable cross-checking different recombination codes across cosmological\nparameter space, a comparison that will be very important in order to assure\nthe accurate interpretation of future cosmic microwave background data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2008 14:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
