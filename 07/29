Despite its central role, the growth and the development\nof the WWW is not controlled by any central authority. This situation has\ncreated a huge ensemble of connections whose complexity can be fruitfully\ndescribed and quantified by network theory. One important application that\nallows to sort out the information present in these connections is given by the\nPageRank alghorithm. Computation of this quantity is usually made iteratively\nwith a large use of computational time.

In particular the topological disorder given by the unbalance of\noutgoing and ingoing links between pages, induces wave function and potential\nstructuring. This allows to directly localize the pages with the largest score.\nThrough this new representation we can now compute the PageRank without\niterative techniques. For most of the cases of interest our method is faster\nthan the original one. Our results also clarify the role of topology in the\ndiffusion of information within complex networks.

The model we consider is the DQC1 or `power of one qubit'\nmodel. I show that there is minimal bipartite entanglement in a typical\ninstance of the DQC1 circuit and even put an upper bound on the possible amount\nof entanglement. This limited amount of entanglement, however, does not imply\nthat the system is classically simulatable. A matrix product state (MPS)\nalgorithm for a typical instance of the DQC1 system requires exponential\nclassical resources. This exposes a gap between the amount of entanglement and\nthe amount of purely nonclassical correlations in a quantum system. This gap, I\nsuggest, can be filled by quantum discord. I calculate it in a typical instance\nof the DQC1 circuit and find that the amount of discord is a constant fraction\nof the maximum possible discord for a system of that size. This allows an\ninterpretation of quantum discord as the resource that drives mixed-state\nquantum computation. I also study quantum discord as a quantity of independent\ninterest. Its role in the phenomenon of entanglement distribution is studied\nthrough an easily comprehensible example.\n  This thesis also contains discussions on the relation between the complexity\nclasses P, BQP and DQC1. Additional material is presented on the connections\nbetween the DQC1 model, Jones polynomials and statistical mechanics. The thesis\nconcludes with a discussion of a few open problems related to the DQC1 model,\nthe quantum discord and their scope in quantum information science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2008 17:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

We propose a generic kinetic description\nof coat assembly and the formation of coated vesicles, and discuss its\nimplication to the dynamics of COP vesicles that traffic within the Golgi and\nwith the Endoplasmic Reticulum. We show that stationary coats of fixed area\nemerge from the competition between coat growth and the recycling of coat\ncomponents, in a fashion resembling the treadmilling of cytoskeletal filaments.\nWe further show that the turnover of coat components allows for a highly\nsensitive switching mechanism between a quiescent and a vesicle producing\nmembrane, upon a slowing down of the exchange kinetics.

The products of the ionization rate and path length for these sight\nlines are 1000 and 10 times higher than in dense and diffuse clouds in the\nGalactic disk, respectively, indicating that the ionization rate, zeta, is not\nless than 10^-15 s^-1 and that L is at least on the order of 50 pc. The warm\nand diffuse gas is an important component of the CMZ, in addition to the three\npreviously known gaseous environments: (1) cold molecular clouds observed by\nradio emission of CO and other molecules, (2) hot (T=10^4-10^6K) and highly\nionized diffuse gas (n_e=10-100cm^-3) seen in radio recombination lines, far\ninfrared atomic lines, and radio-wave scattering, and (3) ultra-hot\n(T=10^7-10^8K) X-ray emitting plasma. Its prevalence significantly changes the\nunderstanding of the environment of the CMZ. The sight line toward GC IRS 3 is\nunique in showing an additional H3+ absorption component, which is interpreted\nas due to either a cloud associated with circumnuclear disk or the \"50 km s^-1\ncloud\" known from radio observations. An infrared pumping scheme is examined as\na mechanism to populate the (3,3) metastable level in this cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2008 19:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In order to measure the kinematics with sufficient\nsignal-to-noise, one uses the satellite galaxies of a large number of central\ngalaxies stacked according to similar properties (e.g., luminosity). However,\nin general the relation between the luminosity of a central galaxy and the mass\nof its host halo will have non-zero scatter. Consequently, this stacking\nresults in combining the kinematics of satellite galaxies in haloes of\ndifferent masses, which complicates the interpretation of the data. In this\npaper we present an analytical framework to model satellite kinematics,\nproperly accounting for this scatter and for various selection effects. We show\nthat in the presence of scatter in the halo mass-luminosity relation, the\ncommonly used velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies can not be used to\ninfer a unique halo mass-luminosity relation. In particular, we demonstrate\nthat there is a degeneracy between the mean and the scatter of the halo\nmass-luminosity relation. We present a new technique that can break this\ndegeneracy, and which involves measuring the velocity dispersions using two\ndifferent weighting schemes: host-weighting (each central galaxy gets the same\nweight) and satellite-weighting (each central galaxy gets a weight proportional\nto its number of satellites). The ratio between the velocity dispersions\nobtained using these two weighting schemes is a strong function of the scatter\nin the halo mass-luminosity relation, and can thus be used to infer a unique\nrelation between light and mass from the kinematics of satellite galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2008 20:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

An early surprise in the study of \\textit{quantum}\ninformation theory was the discovery of dense coding, which demonstrated that\nit is possible to achieve higher rates for communicating classical information\nby transmitting quantum systems, rather than classical ones. To achieve the\nhighest possible rate, the transmitted quantum system must initially be\nmaximally entangled with another that is held by the receiver, and the sender\ncan achieve this rate by encoding her messages with unitary operations. The\nsituation where these two systems are not maximally entangled has been\nintensively studied in recent years, and to date it has appeared as though\nunitary encoding might well be optimal in all cases. Indeed, this optimality of\nunitary operations for quantum communication protocols has been found to hold\nunder far more general conditions, extending well beyond the special case of\ndense coding. Nonetheless, we here present strong numerical evidence supported\nby analytical arguments that indicate there exist circumstances under which one\ncan encode strictly more classical information using dense coding with\nnon-unitary, as opposed to unitary, operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2008 22:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-07"}

Spectroscopic data\nfor the central part of the HRS suggest that A3158 is in a dynamically\nimportant position within the supercluster and that it is moving toward the\ndouble cluster system A3125/A3128 which marks the centre of the HRS. A total of\n110 radio galaxies are detected in a 35 arcminute radius about the cluster at\n1.4 GHz, of which 30 are also detected at 2.5 GHz.We examine the source counts\nand compute the Radio Luminosity Function (RLF) at 1.4 GHz from the subset of\n88 sources found within the fullwidth half-power area of the ATCA beam.\nComparison of the source counts in the area over the background, as computed by\nPrandoni et al.

This result implies that the cores of superclusters are\nenvironments where radio emission, particularly resultant from AGN, is\nsuppressed in the later stages of merging.

A prevalent assumption which often\nguarantees recovery from the given measurements is that $x$ lies in a known\nsubspace. Recently, there has been growing interest in nonlinear but structured\nsignal models, in which $x$ lies in a union of subspaces. In this paper we\ndevelop a general framework for robust and efficient recovery of such signals\nfrom a given set of samples. More specifically, we treat the case in which $x$\nlies in a sum of $k$ subspaces, chosen from a larger set of $m$ possibilities.\nThe samples are modelled as inner products with an arbitrary set of sampling\nfunctions. To derive an efficient and robust recovery algorithm, we show that\nour problem can be formulated as that of recovering a block-sparse vector whose\nnon-zero elements appear in fixed blocks. We then propose a mixed\n$\\ell_2/\\ell_1$ program for block sparse recovery. Our main result is an\nequivalence condition under which the proposed convex algorithm is guaranteed\nto recover the original signal. This result relies on the notion of block\nrestricted isometry property (RIP), which is a generalization of the standard\nRIP used extensively in the context of compressed sensing. Based on RIP we also\nprove stability of our approach in the presence of noise and modelling errors.\n  A special case of our framework is that of recovering multiple measurement\nvectors (MMV) that share a joint sparsity pattern. Adapting our results to this\ncontext leads to new MMV recovery methods as well as equivalence conditions\nunder which the entire set can be determined efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 06:19:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 17:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-30"}

The normal phase with\nnonzero chiral condensate but vanishing Bose condensates coincides with the\nregion of the complex plane where there are no eigenvalues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 06:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Our analysis includes both absorbers arising from the\nintergalactic medium as well as systems in the vicinity of the background\nquasar. We construct detailed photoionization models to study the physical\nconditions and abundances in the absorbers and to constrain the spectral\nhardness of the ionizing radiation. The rate of incidence for intervening NV\ncomponents is dN/dz = 3.38 +/- 0.43, corresponding to dN/dX = 1.10 +/- 0.14.\nThe column density distribution function is fitted by the slope beta = 1.89 +/-\n0.22, consistent with measurements for CIV and OVI. The narrow line widths\n(b_NV ~ 6 km/s) imply photoionization rather than collisions as dominating\nionization process. The column densities of CIV and NV are correlated but show\ndifferent slopes for intervening and associated absorbers, which indicates\ndifferent ionizing spectra. Associated systems are found to be more metal-rich,\ndenser, and more compact than intervening absorbers. This conclusion is\nindependent of the adopted ionizing radiation. For the intervening NV systems\nwe find typical values of [C/H] ~ -0.6 and n_H ~ 10^-3.6 cm^-3, and sizes of a\nfew kpc, while for associated NV absorbers we obtain [C/H] ~ +0.7, n_H ~\n10^-2.8 cm^-3, and sizes of several 10 pc.

Systematic deviations from ideal alignment\nincrease with the extent of the defect wave function.

Complex WKB is derived using a standard saddle point approximation of\nthe path integral, but taking into account the hbar dependence of both the\namplitude and the phase of the intial wave function, thus giving rise to the\nneed for complex classical trajectories. BOMCA is derived using a modification\nof the saddle point technique, in which the path integral is approximated by\nexpanding around a near-classical path, chosen so that up to some predetermined\norder there is no need to add any correction terms to the leading order\napproximation. Both Complex WKB and BOMCA give the same leading order\napproximation; in Complex WKB higher accuracy is achieved by adding correction\nterms, while in BOMCA no additional terms are ever added -higher accuracy is\nachieved by changing the path along which the original approximation is\ncomputed. The path integral derivation of the methods explains the need to\nincorporate contributions from more than one trajectory, as observed in\nprevious numerical work. On the other hand, it emerges that the methods provide\nefficient schemes for computing the higher order terms in the asymptotic\nevaluation of path integrals. The understanding we develop of BOMCA suggests\nthat there should exist near-classical trajectories that give exact quantum\ndynamical results when used in the computation of the path integral keeping\njust the leading order term.

The Curie temperatures are\nestimated ab initio from the electronic structures obtained with the local\nspin-density functional approximation, full-potential generalized gradient\napproximation and/or the LDA+U method (U - Hubbard parameter). Frozen\nspin-spirals are used to model the excited states needed to evaluate the\nspherical approximation for the Curie temperatures. In cases, where the induced\nmoments on the oxygen was found to be large, the determination of the Curie\ntemperature is improved by additional exchange functions between the oxygen\natoms and between oxygen and B' and B\" atoms.\n  A pronounced systematics can be found among the experimental and/or\ncalculated Curie temperatures and the total valence electrons of the transition\nmetal elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 15:37:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2008 10:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

At each point on the manifold, covariance is defined to be a\nsymmetric and positive definite (2,0)-tensor. Its product with the metric\ntensor specifies a linear operator on the respected tangent space.\nCollectively, these operators form a covariance operator field. We show that,\nin most circumstances, covariance fields are continuous. We also solve the\ninverse problem: recovering distribution from a covariance field. Surprisingly,\nthis is not possible on Euclidean spaces. On non-Euclidean manifolds however,\ncovariance fields are true distribution representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 15:39:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 15:03:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 21:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-15"}

Here we describe the\ncorrections in detail and explore their numerical influence. The hadronic\ncontributions to the virtual O(alpha^2) QED corrections to the\nBhabha-scattering cross-section are evaluated using dispersion relations and\ncomputing the convolution of hadronic data with perturbatively calculated\nkernel functions. The technique of dispersion integrals is also employed to\nderive the virtual O(alpha^2) corrections generated by muon-, tau- and\ntop-quark loops in the small electron-mass limit for arbitrary values of the\ninternal-fermion masses. At a meson factory with 1 GeV center-of-mass energy\nthe complete effect of hadronic and heavy-fermion corrections amounts to less\nthan 0.5 per mille and reaches, at 10 GeV, up to about 2 per mille. At the Z\nresonance it amounts to 2.3 per mille at 3 degrees; overall, hadronic\ncorrections are less than 4 per mille. For ILC energies (500 GeV or above), the\ncombined effect of hadrons and heavy-fermions becomes 6 per mille at 3 degrees;\nhadrons contribute less than 20 per mille in the whole angular region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 15:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
