Although scaffolds are widely believed\nto have dramatic effects on the dynamics of signal propagation, the mechanisms\nthat underlie these consequences are not well understood. Here, Monte Carlo\nsimulations of a model kinase cascade are used to investigate how the temporal\ncharacteristics of signaling cascades can be influenced by the presence of\nscaffold proteins. Specifically, we examine the effects of spatially localizing\nkinase components on a scaffold on signaling dynamics. The simulations indicate\nthat a major effect that scaffolds exert on the dynamics of cell signaling is\nto control how the activation of protein kinases is distributed over time.\nScaffolds can influence the timing of kinase activation by allowing for kinases\nto become activated over a broad range of times, thus allowing for signaling at\nboth early and late times. Scaffold concentrations that result in optimal\nsignal amplitude also result in the broadest distributions of times over which\nkinases are activated. These calculations provide insights into one mechanism\nthat describes how the duration of a signal can potentially be regulated in a\nscaffold mediated protein kinase cascade.

Altruistic behavior is modeled by a trade-off between selfish\nand social objectives. In particular, we assume agents optimize a linear\ncombination of personal delay of a strategy and the resulting increase in\nsocial cost. Our model can be embedded in the framework of congestion games\nwith player-specific latency functions. Stable states are the Nash equilibria\nof these games, and we examine their existence and the convergence of\nsequential best-response dynamics. Previous work shows that for symmetric\nsingleton games with convex delays Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist. For\nconcave delay functions we observe that there are games without Nash equilibria\nand provide a polynomial time algorithm to decide existence for symmetric\nsingleton games with arbitrary delay functions. Our algorithm can be extended\nto compute best and worst Nash equilibria if they exist. For more general\ncongestion games existence becomes NP-hard to decide, even for symmetric\nnetwork games with quadratic delay functions. Perhaps surprisingly, if all\ndelay functions are linear, then there is always a Nash equilibrium in any\ncongestion game with altruists and any better-response dynamics converges. In\naddition to these results for uncoordinated dynamics, we consider a scenario in\nwhich a central altruistic institution can motivate agents to act\naltruistically. We provide constructive and hardness results for finding the\nminimum number of altruists to stabilize an optimal congestion profile and more\ngeneral mechanisms to incentivize agents to adopt favorable behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jul 2008 05:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 16:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-04"}

While the\ncoronal properties of flares are studied best in X-rays, the chromosphere of\nthe star is observed best in the optical and ultraviolet ranges. Therefore,\nmultiwavelength observations are essential to study flare properties throughout\nthe atmosphere of a star. We analysed simultaneous observations with UVES/VLT\nand XMM-Newton of the active M5.5 dwarf CN Leo (Gl 406) exhibiting a major\nflare. The optical data cover the wavelength range from 3000 to 10000 Angstrom.\n  From our optical data, we find an enormous wealth of chromospheric emission\nlines occurring throughout the spectrum. We identify a total of 1143 emission\nlines, out of which 154 are located in the red arm, increasing the number of\nobserved emission lines in this red wavelength range by about a factor of 10.\nHere we present an emission line list and a spectral atlas. We also find line\nasymmetries for H I, He I, and Ca II lines. For the last, this is the first\nobservation of asymmetries due to a stellar flare. During the flare onset,\nthere is additional flux found in the blue wing, while in the decay phase,\nadditional flux is found in the red wing. We interpret both features as caused\nby mass motions. In addition to the lines, the flare manifests itself in the\nenhancement of the continuum throughout the whole spectrum, inverting the\nnormal slope for the net flare spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jul 2008 11:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-15"}

The agents are connected by a\nnetwork of interaction of Erd\\H{o}s-Renyi or Barabasi-Albert type.
