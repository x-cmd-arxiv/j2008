Recalling the problem raised by vacuum field\nfluctuations with respect to inertia and gravitation, we show that vacuum\nenergy differences, such as Casimir energy, do contribute to inertia. Mass\nbehaves as a quantum observable and in particular possesses quantum\nfluctuations. We show that the compatibility of the quantum nature of mass with\ngravitation can be ensured by conformal symmetries, which allow one to\nformulate a quantum version of the equivalence principle. Finally, we consider\nsome corrections to the coupling between metric fields and energy-momentum\ntensors induced by radiative corrections. Newton gravitation constant is\nreplaced by two different running coupling constants in the sectors of\ntraceless and traced tensors. There result metric extensions of general\nrelativity, which can be characterized by modified Ricci curvatures or by two\ngravitation potentials. The corresponding phenomenological framework extends\nthe usual Parametrized Post-Newtonian one, with the ability to remain\ncompatible with classical tests of gravity while accounting for new features,\nsuch as Pioneer like anomalies or anomalous light deflection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2008 15:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}

We demonstrate that rotating\nconvection in a Cartesian domain can drive a large-scale dynamo even in the\nabsence of shear. The large-scale field contains a significant fraction of the\ntotal field in the saturated state. The simulation results are compared with\none-dimensional mean-field dynamo models where turbulent transport\ncoefficients, as determined using the test field method, are used. The reason\nfor the absence of large-scale dynamo action in earlier studies is shown to be\ndue to the rotation being too slow: whereas the alpha-effect can change sign,\nits magnitude stays approximately constant as a function of rotation, and the\nturbulent diffusivity decreases monotonically with increasing rotation.

The\none-dimensional mean-field model with dynamo coefficients from the test field\nresults predicts reasonably well the dynamo excitation in the direct\nsimulations.

The construction of such models usually rely\non the Plebanski formulation of general relativity as a constrained BF theory\nand is based on the discretization of the action on a simplicial triangulation,\nwhich may be viewed as an ultraviolet regulator. The triangulation dependence\ncan be removed by means of group field theory techniques, which allows one to\nsum over all triangulations. The main tasks for these models are the correct\nquantum implementation of the Plebanski constraints, the existence of a\nsemiclassical sector implementing additional \"Regge-like\" constraints arising\nfrom simplicial triangulations, and the definition of the physical inner\nproduct of loop quantum gravity via group field theory. Here we propose a new\napproach to tackle these issues stemming directly from the Holst action for\ngeneral relativity, which is also a proper starting point for canonical loop\nquantum gravity. The discretization is performed by means of a \"cubulation\" of\nthe manifold rather than a triangulation. We give a direct interpretation of\nthe resulting spin foam model as a generating functional for the n-point\nfunctions on the physical Hilbert space at finite regulator. This paper focuses\non ideas and tasks to be performed before the model can be taken seriously.\nHowever, our analysis reveals some interesting features of this model: first,\nthe structure of its amplitudes differs from the standard spin foam models.\nSecond, the tetrad n-point functions admit a \"Wick-like\" structure.

Consequently, the use by Wernsdorfer et\nal. of a single DM vector in a centrosymmetric dimer is strictly forbidden\nsince it implicitly violates parity conservation. The authors correctly point\nout that the lack of an inversion center between each pair of manganese ions on\nthe wheel justifies the possibility of local DM interactions, even though the\ncomplete molecule has an inversion center. However, these local DM interactions\nmust also satisfy the molecular inversion symmetry; i.e., they cannot mix\nstates of opposite parity.We agree that such DM interactions are not always\ncompletely innocuous; e.g., they can mix spin states having the same parity.\nIndeed, in kagome systems [3] (cited in [1]), this can lead to weak\nferromagnetism.

Concerning coarsening, it turns out that\nthe most widely used criterion for merging clusters (modularity increase) is\noutperformed by other simple criteria, and that a recent algorithm by Schuetz\nand Caflisch is no improvement over simple greedy coarsening for these\ncriteria. Concerning refinement, a new multi-level algorithm is shown to\nproduce significantly better clusterings than conventional single-level\nalgorithms.

In certain parameter regions, our model can explain some\nobservational results properly. In large halos(T_vir>10000 K), both mechanical\nand radiative feedback have a similar behavior: the relative strength of\nnegative feedback reduces as the redshift decreases. In contrast, in small\nhalos (T_vir<10000 K$) that are thought to breed the first stars at early time,\nthe radiative feedback gets stronger when the redshift decreases. And the star\nformation rate in these small halos depends very weakly on the star-formation\nefficiency. Our results show that the radiative feedback is important for the\nearly generation stars. It can suppress the star formation rate considerably.\nBut the mechanical feedback from the SNe explosions is not able to affect the\nearly star formation significantly. The early star formation in small-halo\nobjects is likely to be self-regulated. The radiative and mechanical feedback\ndominates the star formation rate of the PopII/I stars all along. The feedback\nfrom first generation stars is very strong and should not be neglected.\nHowever, their effects on the cosmic reionization are not significant, which\nresults in a small contribution to the optical depth of Thomson scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2008 03:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

There are now known examples of strongly coupled (rung exchange\ninteraction much stronger than nearest-neighbour intrachain exchange\ninteraction) organic ladder compounds in which QPTs have been experimentally\nobserved. In this paper, we investigate whether well-known bipartite\nentanglement meaures like one-site von Neumann entropy, two-site von Neumann\nentropy and concurrence develop special features close to the quantum critical\npoints. As suggested by an earlier theorem, the first derivatives of the\nmeasures with respect to magnetic field are expected to diverge as H tends to\nHc1 and Hc2. Based on numerical diagonalization data and a mapping of the\nstrongly-coupled ladder Hamiltonian onto the XXZ chain Hamiltonian, for which\nseveral analytical results are known, we find that the derivatives of the\nentanglement measures diverge as H tends to Hc2 but remain finite as H tend to\nHc1.

A recent analysis of the 2XMMp catalogue\nprovided less than 30 new thermally emitting INS candidates.

The calculations are done with the help of an\nimproved binary collisions treatment which is valid for any strength of the\nmagnetic field, where the second-order energy and velocity transfers are\nrepresented in Fourier space for arbitrary interaction potentials. The energy\ntransfer is explicitly calculated for a regularized and screened potential\nwhich is both of finite range and non-singular at the origin, and which\ninvolves as limiting cases the Debye (i.e., screened) and Coulomb potential.\nTwo distinct cases are considered in detail.

The energy transfer\ninvolves all harmonics of the electron cyclotron motion. The validity of the\nperturbation treatment is evaluated by comparing with classical trajectory\nMonte--Carlo calculations which also allows to investigate the strong\ncollisions with large energy and velocity transfer at low velocities.

It is assumed that the\ncurrents are concentrated in thin current sheets, as suggested by theories of\ntwo dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The Spitzer result for the\nresistivity is adopted as a lower limit to the true resistivity. The calculated\nvolumetric heating rate is compared with an independent theoretical estimate by\nCranmer et al (2007). This latter estimate accounts for the dynamic and\nthermodynamic properties of the corona at a heliocentric distance of several\nsolar radii. Our calculated Joule heating rate is less than the Cranmer et al\nestimate by at least a factor of $3 \\times 10^5$. The currents inferred from\nthe observations of Spangler (2007) are not relevant to coronal heating unless\nthe true resistivity is enormously increased relative to the Spitzer value.\nHowever, the same model for turbulent current sheets used to calculate the\nheating rate also gives an electron drift speed which can be comparable to the\nelectron thermal speed, and larger than the ion acoustic speed. It is therefore\npossible that the coronal current sheets are unstable to current-driven\ninstabilities which produce high levels of waves, enhance the resistivity and\nthus the heating rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2008 15:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Several different definitions of entropy are known in our\ndays. The one we describe here is quite natural and extends the usual one for\nDynamical Systems in Thermodynamic Formalism Theory. It has the advantage of\nbeen very easy to be introduced. It is basically obtained from transfer\noperators (also called Ruelle operators). Later we introduce the concept of\npressure as a min-max principle.\n  Finally, we consider the concept of a KMS state as an equilibrium state for a\npotential (in the context of $C^*$-Algebras) and we show that there is a\nrelation between KMS states for certain algebras coming from a continuous\ntransformation and equilibrium measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2008 15:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}
