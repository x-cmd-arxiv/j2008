We find that the Universe does not reheat immediately through\nperturbative decays, but rather initiate a complex process in which\nperturbative and non-perturbative effects are mixed. The Higgs condesate starts\noscillating around the minimum of its potential, producing W and Z gauge bosons\nnon-perturbatively, due to violation of the so-called adiabaticity condition.\nHowever, during each semi-oscillation, the created gauge bosons completely\ndecay (perturbatively) into fermions. This way, the decay of the gauge bosons\nprevents the development of parametric resonance, since bosons cannot\naccummulate significantly at the beginning. However, the energy transferred to\nthe decay products of the bosons is not enough to reheat the universe, so after\nabout a hundred oscillations, the resonance effect will finally dominate over\nthe perturbative decays. Around the same time (or slightly earlier),\nbackreaction from the gauge bosons onto the Higgs condensate will also start to\nbe significant. Soon afterwards, the Universe is filled with the remnant\ncondensate of the Higgs and a non-thermal distribution of Standard Model\nparticles which redshift as radiation, while the Higgs continues to oscillate\nas a pressureless fluid. We compute the distribution of energy among all the\nspecies present at backreaction.

Rapid pulsations are found present in all events observed\nat the two frequencies of the solar submillimeter-wave telescope (SST): 212 and\n405 GHz. They were studied in greater detail for three solar bursts exhibiting\nthe new THz spectral component. The pulse amplitudes are of about 5-8% of the\nmean flux throughout the bursts durations, being comparable for both\nfrequencies. Pulsations range from one pulse every few seconds to 8-10 per\nsecond. The pulse repetition rates (R) are linearly proportional to the mean\nburst fluxes (S), following the simple relationship S = k R, suggesting that\nthe pulsations might be the response to discrete flare particle accelerator\ninjections quantized in energy.

However, the mechanism behind it is still not clear. The most popular\nmodel for this RDP is High Latitude Emission (HLE). While HLE is expected in\nmany models for the prompt GRB emission, such as the popular internal shocks\nmodel, there are models in which it is not expected, such as sporadic magnetic\nreconnection events. Therefore, testing whether the RDP is consistent with HLE\ncan help distinguish between different prompt emission models. We address this\nquestion by modeling the prompt emission as the sum of its individual pulses\nwith their HLE tails. Analytic expressions for the observed flux density are\nobtained for power-law and Band function emission spectra. For internal shocks\nthe observed instantaneous spectrum is very close to the emitted one, and\nshould be well described by a Band function also during the RDP. Our model\nnaturally produces, the observed spectral softening and steepening of the flux\ndecay. The observed flux during the RDP is initially dominated by the tail of\nthe last pulse, but the tails of one or more earlier pulses can become dominant\nlater on. Moreover, modeling several overlapping pulses as a single wider pulse\nwould over-predict the emission tail. Thus, one should be very careful when\ntesting the predictions of HLE and do a combined temporal and spectral fit of\nthe prompt GRB emission and the RDP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 2008 13:34:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2009 15:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Conventionally entanglement is formed between two distinct beams,\nwith the quantum correlations being measured at separate locations. We show\nentanglement between the modes within one beam. Our technique is particularly\nelegant and a major advance towards practical systems with minimum complexity.\nWe demonstrate three major experimental achievements: (i) only one source is\nrequired to produce squeezed light in two orthogonal spatial modes, (ii) the\nentanglement is formed through lenses and beam rotation, without the need of a\nbeam splitter and (iii) the quantum correlations are measured directly and\nsimultaneously using a multi pixel, quadrant detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 2008 15:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-31"}
