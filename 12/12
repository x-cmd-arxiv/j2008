Both Galactic synchrotron emission and\npolarized thermal emission from dust reflect statistics of magnetic field\nfluctuations and, therefore, Galactic turbulence. We mainly focus on the\nrelation between observed angular spectra and underlying turbulence statistics.\nOur major findings are as follows. First, we find that magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) turbulence in the Galaxy can indeed explain diffuse synchrotron emission\nfrom high galactic latitude. Our model calculation suggests that either a\none-component extended halo model or a two-component model, an extended halo\ncomponent (scale height > 1kpc) plus a local component, can explain the\nobserved angular spectrum of the synchrotron emission. However, discrete\nsources seem to dominate the spectrum for regions near the Galactic plane.\nSecond, we study how star-light polarization is related with polarized emission\nfrom thermal dust. We also discuss the expected angular spectrum of polarized\nemission from thermal dust. Our model calculations suggest that C_l\\propto\nl^{-11/3} for l > 1000 and a shallower spectrum for l < 1000.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2008 16:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-12"}

This is the first attempt to test a\nmodel of fast magnetic reconnection proposed by Lazarian & Vishniac (1999),\nwhich assumes the presence of weak, small-scale magnetic field structure near\nthe current sheet. This affects the rate of reconnection by reducing the\ntransverse scale for reconnection flows and by allowing many independent flux\nreconnection events to occur simultaneously. We performed a number of\nsimulations to test the dependencies of the reconnection speed, defined as the\nratio of the inflow velocity to the Alfven speed, on the turbulence power, the\ninjection scale and resistivity. Our results show that turbulence significantly\naffects the topology of magnetic field near the diffusion region and increases\nthe thickness of the outflow region. We confirm the predictions of the Lazarian\n& Vishniac model. In particular, we report the growth of the reconnection speed\nproportional to ~ V^2, where V is the amplitude of velocity at the injection\nscale. It depends on the injection scale l as ~ (l/L)^(2/3), where L is the\nsize of the system, which is somewhat faster but still roughly consistent with\nthe theoretical expectations. We also show that for 3D reconnection the Ohmic\nresistivity is important in the local reconnection events only, and the global\nreconnection rate in the presence of turbulence does not depend on it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2008 16:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-12"}

Analytical studies of\nhydrodynamic accretion disks have shown three types of trapped global modes\nwith properties that appear to agree with the observations. However, these\nstudies take only linear effects into account and do not address the issues of\nmode excitation and decay. Moreover, observations suggest that resonances\nbetween modes play a crucial role. A systematic, numerical study of this\nproblem is therefore needed. In this paper, we use a pseudo-spectral algorithm\nto perform a parameter study of the inner regions of hydrodynamic disks. By\nassuming alpha-viscosity, we show that steady state solutions rarely exist. The\ninner edges of the disks oscillate and excite axisymmetric waves. In addition,\nthe flows inside the inner edges are sometimes unstable to non-axisymmetric\nperturbations. One-armed, or even two-armed, spirals are developed, which\nprovides a plausible explanation for the high-frequency QPOs observed from\naccreting black holes. When the Reynolds numbers are above certain critical\nvalues, the inner disks go through some transient turbulent states\ncharacterized by strong trailing spirals; while large-scale leading spirals\ndeveloped in the outer disks. We compared our numerical results with standard\nthin disk oscillation models. Although the non-axisymmetric features have their\nanalytical counterparts, more careful study is needed to explain the\naxisymmetric oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2008 20:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

This finding should have a profound impact on all\nmodule assisted methods of protein function prediction and should shed new\nlight on how functional modules can be represented in molecular interaction\nnetworks in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2008 16:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-22"}

Energy loss of semihard and hard partons\ntraversing the nuclear medium is parametrized in a way that renders good fit of\nthe single-particle inclusive distributions at all centralities. The associated\nhadron distribution in the near-side jet can be determined showing weak\ndependence on system size because of trigger bias. The inverse slope increases\nwith trigger momentum in agreement with data. The distribution of associated\nparticle in the away-side jet is also studied with careful attention given to\nantitrigger bias that is due to the longer path length that the away-side jet\nrecoiling against the trigger jet must propagate in the medium to reach the\nopposite side. Centrality dependence is taken into account after determining a\nrealistic probability distribution of the dynamical path length of the parton\ntrajectory within each class of centrality. For symmetric dijets with\np_T^{trig}=p_T^{assoc}(away) it is shown that the per-trigger yield is\ndominated by tangential jets. The average parton momentum for the recoil jet is\nshown to be always larger than that of the trigger jet for fixed p_T^{trig} and\ncentrality and for any measurable p_T^{assoc}(away). With the comprehensive\ntreatment of dijet production described here it is possible to answer many\nquestions regarding the behavior of partons in the medium under conditions that\ncan be specified on measurable hadron momenta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2008 17:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

Calculating\ndefining relations in terms of these generators allows us to derive SLq(n) type\ndynamical R-matrices in a surprisingly simple way. Second, we calculate an\nevolution operator for the model of q-deformed isotropic top introduced by\nA.Alekseev and L.Faddeev. The evolution operator is not uniquely defined and we\npresent two possible expressions for it. The first one is a Riemann theta\nfunction in the spectral variables. The second one is an almost free motion\nevolution operator in terms of logarithms of the spectral variables. Relation\nbetween the two operators is given by a modular functional equation for Riemann\ntheta function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2008 19:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Sampling from these distributions is crucial for parameter\nestimation hypothesis testing, and more generally for understanding basic\nfeatures of the network model itself. In practice sampling is typically carried\nout using Markov chain Monte Carlo, in particular either the Glauber dynamics\nor the Metropolis-Hasting procedure.\n  In this paper we characterize the high and low temperature regimes of the\nexponential random graph model. We establish that in the high temperature\nregime the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics is $\\Theta(n^2 \\log n)$, where\n$n$ is the number of vertices in the graph; in contrast, we show that in the\nlow temperature regime the mixing is exponentially slow for any local Markov\nchain. Our results, moreover, give a rigorous basis for criticisms made of such\nmodels.

SUMMARY: The final\ngoal of robots is to allow safer and more homogeneous outcomes with less\nvariability of surgeon performance, as well as new tools to perform tasks on\nthe basis of medical transcutaneous imaging, in a less invasive way, at lower\ncosts. It is expected that improvements for a remote system could be augmented\nin reality, with haptic feedback, size reduction, and development of new tools\nfor natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery. The paradigm of\nimage-guided robots is close to clinical availability and the most advanced\nrobots are presented with end-user technical assessments. It is also notable\nthat the potential of robots lies much further ahead than the accomplishments\nof the daVinci system. The integration of imaging with robotics holds a\nsubstantial promise, because this can accomplish tasks otherwise impossible.\nImage-guided robots have the potential to offer a paradigm shift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 08:38:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-15"}

A\nmethodology is presented to routinely derive integral properties of the longer\nwavelength (swell) portion of the wave spectrum from SAR Level 2 products, and\nboth monitor and predict their evolution across ocean basins. SAR-derived\nestimates of swell height, and energy-weighted peak period and direction, are\nvalidated against buoy observations, and the peak directions are used to\nproject the peak periods in one dimension along the corresponding great circle\nroute, both forward and back in time, using the peak period group velocity. The\nresulting real time dataset of great circle-projected peak periods produces\ntwo-dimensional maps that can be used to monitor and predict the spatial\nextent, and temporal evolution, of individual ocean swell fields as they\npropagate from their source region to distant coastlines. The methodology is\nfound to be consistent with the dispersive arrival of peak swell periods at a\nmid-ocean buoy. The simple great circle propagation method cannot project the\nswell heights in space like the peak periods, because energy evolution along a\ngreat circle is a function of the source storm characteristics and the unknown\nswell dissipation rate. A more general geometric optics model is thus proposed\nfor the far field of the storms. This model is applied here to determine the\nattenuation over long distances. For one of the largest recorded storms,\nobservations of 15 s period swells are consistent with a constant dissipation\nrate that corresponds to a 3300 km e-folding scale for the energy. In this\ncase, swell dissipation is a significant term in the wave energy balance at\nglobal scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 08:55:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 09:25:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2009 15:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-23"}

In LFAOF,\nboth magnetism and superconductivity develop simultaneously below a common\ncritical temperature, $T_m =~ T_c =~ 18$ K, where the magnetism is\ncharacterized by strong randomness. A similar, but more distinct segregation of\nthese two phases is observed in CFCAF, where the magnetic phase retains $T_m$\nas close to that of the parent compound ($T_c << T_m =~ 80$--120 K) and the\nsuperconducting volume fraction is proportional to the Co content $x$. The\nclose relationship between magnetism and superconductivity is discussed based\non these experimental observations. Concerning superconducting phase, an\nassessment is made on the anisotropy of order parameter in the superconducting\nstate of LFAOF, CFCAF, and Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ (BKFA, $x=0.4$) based on\nthe temperature dependence of superfluid density [$n_s(T)$] measured by muSR.\nThe gap parameter, $2\\Delta/k_BT_c$, determined from $n_s(T)$ exhibits a\ntendency that hole-doped pnictides (BKFA) is much greater than those in\nelectron-doped ones (LFAOF, CFCAF), suggesting difference in the coupling to\nbosons mediating the Cooper pairs between relevant $d$ electron bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 09:11:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 06:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-01"}

This problem has been widely studied in a number of works during\nthe past decade for frequency-selective channels, and recently for the more\ngeneral MIMO case, for which the state-of-the art results are valid only for\nnonsingular square channel matrices. Surprisingly, these results do not hold\ntrue when the channel matrices are rectangular and/or rank deficient matrices.\nThe goal of this paper is to provide a complete characterization of the MIMO\ngame for arbitrary channel matrices, in terms of conditions guaranteeing both\nthe uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium and the convergence of asynchronous\ndistributed iterative waterfilling algorithms. Our analysis hinges on new\ntechnical intermediate results, such as a new expression for the MIMO\nwaterfilling projection valid (also) for singular matrices, a mean-value\ntheorem for complex matrix-valued functions, and a general contraction theorem\nfor the multiuser MIMO watefilling mapping valid for arbitrary channel\nmatrices. The quite surprising result is that uniqueness/convergence conditions\nin the case of tall (possibly singular) channel matrices are more restrictive\nthan those required in the case of (full rank) fat channel matrices. We also\npropose a modified game and algorithm with milder conditions for the uniqueness\nof the equilibrium and convergence, and virtually the same performance (in\nterms of Nash equilibria) of the original game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 09:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A cyclotron line at ~30 keV has been suggested by\nvarious authors but never detected with significance. The stellar wind of the\noptical companion is abnormally slow. The orbital period, initially reported to\nbe 9.6 days, disappeared and a new periodicity of 19.25 days emerged.

Initially detected in RXTE data, these pulsations\nare also present in INTEGRAL and EXOSAT observations. The average X-ray\nluminosity in the energy range 2-10 keV is 1.5 x 10^{35} erg s^{-1} with a\nratio Fmax/Fmin ~ 5.

In this sense the\n2D Ising model is said to be \"complete\". However, in order to obtain the above\nresult, the coupling strengths on the 2D lattice must assume complex values,\nand thus do not allow for a physical interpretation. Here we show how a\ncomplete model with real -and, hence, \"physical\"- couplings can be obtained if\nthe 3D Ising model is considered. We furthermore show how to map general\nq-state systems with possibly many-body interactions to the 2D Ising model with\ncomplex parameters, and give completeness results for these models with real\nparameters. We also demonstrate that the computational overhead in these\nconstructions is in all relevant cases polynomial.

In\nthis paper, we obtain a new lower bound on the minimum-error probability for\nambiguous discrimination and compare this bound with six other bounds in the\nliterature. Moreover, we show that the bound between ambiguous and unambiguous\ndiscrimination does not extend to ensembles of more than two states.\nSpecifically, the main technical contributions are described as follows: (1) We\nderive a new lower bound on the minimum-error probability for ambiguous\ndiscrimination among arbitrary $m$ mixed quantum states with given prior\nprobabilities, and we present a necessary and sufficient condition to show that\nthis lower bound is attainable.

From this we estimate radiation field, gas\ntemperature, and electron density. We find systematic variations in\nphotoelectric efficiency. The highest efficiencies are found in the diffuse\nmedium, while the lowest coincide with bright star-forming regions (~1.4 times\nlower).
