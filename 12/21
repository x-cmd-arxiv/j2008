From the Principle\nof Equivalence it follows that there must be also a gravitational shift in\npresence of matter.

However, because accelerated particles are responsible for\nsubstantial amplification of the ambient magnetic field in a region upstream of\nthe shock front, we examine an alternative approach in which particles escape\nover a spatial boundary. We use a simple iterative scheme that constructs\nstationary numerical solutions to the coupled kinetic and hydrodynamic\nequations.

Observations indicate that some of the\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the luminosities of accreting\ncompact objects (neutron stars, black holes and white dwarfs) are produced in\nthe inner-most regions of accretion discs or boundary layers. Two simple models\nare considered in this paper: The magnetosphere-disc model consists of a thin\nKeplerian disc in contact with a uniformly rotating magnetosphere with and low\nplasma density, while the star-disc model involves a Keplerian disc terminated\nat the stellar atomosphere with high density and small density scale height. We\nfind that the interface modes at the magnetosphere-disc boundary are generally\nunstable due to Rayleigh-Taylor and/or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However,\ndifferential rotation of the disc tends to suppress Rayleigh-Taylor instability\nand a sufficiently high disc sound speed (or temperature) is needed to overcome\nthis suppression and to attain net mode growth. On the other hand,\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability may be active at low disc sound speeds. We also\nfind that the interface modes trapped at the boundary between a thin disc and\nan unmagnetized star do not suffer Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability, but can become unstable due to wave leakage to large disc radii\nand, for sufficiently steep disc density distributions, due to wave absorption\nat the corotation resonance in the disc. The non-axisymmetric interface modes\nstudied in this paper may be relevant to the high-frequency QPOs observed in\nsome X-ray binaries and in cataclysmic variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Dec 2008 20:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Until recently, their effects on magnetic field\namplification in disk galaxies remained a matter of speculation. By means of\nself-consistent simulations of supernova-driven turbulence, we find an\nexponential amplification of the mean magnetic field on timescales of a few\nhundred million years. The robustness of the observed fast dynamo is checked at\ndifferent magnetic Reynolds numbers, and we find sustained dynamo action at\nmoderate Rm. This indicates that the mechanism might indeed be of relevance for\nthe real ISM.\n  Sensing the flow via passive tracer fields, we infer that SNe produce a\nturbulent alpha effect which is consistent with the predictions of quasilinear\ntheory. To lay a foundation for global mean-field models, we aim to explore the\nscaling of the dynamo tensors with respect to the key parameters of our\nsimulations. Here we give a first account on the variation with the supernova\nrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 2008 08:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The magnetic monopole defined\nin this way is a topological object of co-dimension 3, i.e., a loop in\nfour-dimensions. We show that such magnetic loops indeed exist in\nfour-dimensional Yang-Mills theory.

An accurate estimate of the local standard of rest (LSR) is required\nto determine key parameters used in approximate galactic mass models and to\nunderstand Galactic structure and evolution. However, authors are often forced\nto base dynamical analyses on potentially unreliable figures because recent\ndeterminations of the LSR have failed to reach agreement, especially with\nregard to the direction, V, of Galactic rotation. Aims. To explain why the\ntraditional method for calculating the LSR fails, and to find alternative means\nof calculating the LSR with realistic error margins. Methods. We assemble and\ninvestigate the kinematic properties of 20 574 stars within 300pc, with\ncomplete and accurate kinematic data. The traditional method of calculating the\nLSR assumes a well-mixed distribution. In fact, the velocity distribution is\nhighly structured, invalidating calculations based on mean motions and\nasymmetric drift. We find other indicators in the distribution which we believe\ngive a better estimate of circular motion. Results.
