Line-strength indices in the bar region are\nmeasured to derive stellar mean-age and metallicity distributions along the\nbars using stellar population models. We find three different types of bars\naccording to their metallicity and age distribution along the radius: 1) Bars\nwith negative metallicity gradients. They show mean young/intermediate\npopulation (< 2 Gyr), and have amongst the lowest stellar maximum central\nvelocity dispersion of the sample. 2) Bars with null metallicity gradients.\nThese galaxies tend to have negative age gradients. 3) Bars with positive\nmetallicity gradients.

We found no significant\ncorrelation between the age and metallicity distribution, and bar/galaxy\nparameters such as the AGN presence, size or the bar strength. From the\nkinematics, we find that all the galaxies show a disk-like central component.\nThe results from the metallicity and age gradients indicate that most galaxies\nwith high central stellar velocity dispersion host bars that could have been\nformed more than 3 Gyrs ago, while galaxies with lower central velocity\ndispersions show a wider distribution in their population and age gradients. A\nfew bars show characteristics compatible with having been formed less than <2\nGy ago. These results place strong constrains to models of bar formation and\nevolution.

A comparison of the reconstructed density\ncontrast with observations of large scale structure and gravitational lensing\ncan help distinguish DE models such as the cosmological constant and\nquintessence from models based on modified gravity theories as well as models\nin which DE and DM are either unified, or interact directly. We show that for\ncurrent SNe data, the linear growth factor at z = 0.3 can be constrained to 5%,\nand the linear growth rate to 6%. With future SNe data, such as expected from\nthe JDEM mission, we may be able to constrain the growth factor to 2-3% and the\ngrowth rate to 3-4% at z = 0.3 with this unbiased, model-independent\nreconstruction method. For future BAO data which would deliver measurements of\nboth the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter, it should be possible\nto constrain the growth factor at z = 2.5 to 9%. These constraints grow tighter\nwith the errors on the datasets. With a large quantity of data expected in the\nnext few years, this method can emerge as a competitive tool for distinguishing\nbetween different models of dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2008 16:21:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2009 17:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-27"}

This\nnaturally leads to \"unitary circuit models\", which are models of computation in\nwhich unitary operators are expressed as a product of \"elementary\" unitary\ntransformations. However, unitary transformations can also be effected as a\ncomposition of operations which are not all unitary themselves: the \"one-way\nmeasurement model\" is one such model of quantum computation.\n  In this thesis, we examine the relationship between representations of\nunitary operators and decompositions of those operators in the one-way\nmeasurement model. In particular, we consider different circumstances under\nwhich a procedure in the one-way measurement model can be described as\nsimulating a unitary circuit, by considering the combinatorial structures which\nare common to unitary circuits and two simple constructions of one-way based\nprocedures. These structures lead to a characterization of the one-way\nmeasurement patterns which arise from these constructions, which can then be\nrelated to efficiently testable properties of graphs. We also consider how\nthese characterizations provide automatic techniques for obtaining complete\nmeasurement-based decompositions, from unitary transformations which are\nspecified by operator expressions bearing a formal resemblance to path\nintegrals. These techniques are presented as a possible means to devise new\nalgorithms in the one-way measurement model, independently of algorithms in the\nunitary circuit model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2008 18:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-16"}

The extinction mapping\ntechnique requires modeling the IR background intensity behind the cloud, which\nis achieved by correcting for foreground emission and then interpolating from\nthe surrounding regions. The correction for foreground emission can be quite\nlarge, thus restricting the utility of this technique to relatively nearby\nclouds. We investigate three methods for the interpolation, finding systematic\ndifferences at about the 10% level, which, for fiducial dust models,\ncorresponds to a mass surface density Sigma = 0.013 g cm^-2, above which we\nconclude this extinction mapping technique attains validity. We examine the\nprobability distribution function of Sigma in IRDCs. From a qualitative\ncomparison with numerical simulations of astrophysical turbulence, many clouds\nappear to have relatively narrow distributions suggesting relatively low (<5)\nMach numbers and/or dynamically strong magnetic fields. Given cloud kinematic\ndistances, we derive cloud masses. Rathborne, Jackson & Simon identified cores\nwithin the clouds and measured their masses via mm dust emission. For 43 cores,\nwe compare these mass estimates with those derived from our extinction mapping,\nfinding good agreement: typically factors of <~2 difference for individual\ncores and an average systematic offset of <~10% for the adopted fiducial\nassumptions of each method. We find tentative evidence for a systematic\nvariation of these mass ratios as a function of core density, which is\nconsistent with models of ice mantle formation on dust grains and subsequent\ngrain growth by coagulation, and/or with a temperature decrease in the densest\ncores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2008 18:47:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2008 10:36:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 20:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 19:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Column\ndensities are derived directly from the observed line profiles except for HI,\nwhose lines are contaminated by stellar absorption. We used the TLUSTY models\nto remove the stellar continuum and isolate the interstellar component. The\nbest fit indicates that the dominant stellar population is B0. The fit of the\ninterstellar HI line gives a column density of 10^{20.3\\pm0.4} cm-2. Chemical\nabundances were then computed from the column densities using the dominant\nionization stage in the neutral gas. Our abundances are compared to those\nmeasured from emission-line spectra in the optical.

Conclusions:\nThe abundance discontinuity between the neutral and ionized phases implies that\nmost of the metals released by consecutive star-formation episodes mixes with\nthe HI gas. The volume extent of the enrichment is so large that the\nmetallicity of the neutral gas increases only slightly.

These abundance anomalies can\nbe created in the H-burning core of a first generation of fast rotating massive\nstars and the corresponding elements are convoyed to the stellar surface thanks\nto rotational induced mixing. If the rotation of the stars is fast enough this\nmatter is ejected at low velocity through a mechanical wind at the equator. It\nthen pollutes the ISM from which a second generation of chemically anomalous\nstars can be formed. The proportion of anomalous to normal star observed today\ndepends on at least two quantities : (1) the number of polluter stars; (2) the\ndynamical history of the cluster which may lose during its lifetime first and\nsecond generation stars in different proportions. Here we estimate these\nproportions based on dynamical models for globular clusters.

Relying on the\nFIR-radio correlation within normal galaxies, we use our infrared data to\ncreate model radio maps which we compare to the observed radio images. For 6 of\nour sample galaxies we find regions along their outer edges that are highly\ndeficient in the radio compared with our models. We believe these observations\nare the signatures of ICM ram pressure. For NGC 4522 we find the radio deficit\nregion to lie just exterior to a region of high radio polarization and flat\nradio spectral index, although the total 20 cm radio continuum in this region\ndoes not appear strongly enhanced. These characteristics seem consistent for\nother galaxies with radio polarization data in the literature. The strength of\nthe radio deficit is inversely correlated with the time since peak pressure as\ninferred from stellar population studies and gas stripping simulations,\nsuggesting the strength of the radio deficit is good indicator of the strength\nof the current ram pressure. We also find that galaxies having {\\it local}\nradio {\\it deficits} appear to have {\\it enhanced global} radio fluxes. Our\npreferred physical picture is that the observed radio deficit regions arise\nfrom the ICM wind sweeping away cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and the associated\nmagnetic field, thereby creating synchrotron tails as observed for some of our\ngalaxies. We propose that CR particles are also re-accelerated by ICM-driven\nshocklets behind the observed radio deficit regions which in turn enhances the\nremaining radio disk brightness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2008 22:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Even though the Born-Infeld description\nis only a probe approximation, we find that it gives exactly the same essential\nphysics as the complete supergravity solution. Since supertubes can depend on\narbitrary functions, our analysis strengthens the evidence for the existence of\nthree-charge black-hole microstate geometries that depend on an infinite set of\nparameters, and sets the stage for the computation of the entropy of these\nbackgrounds. We examine numerous other aspects of supertubes in three-charge,\nthree-dipole charge supergravity backgrounds, including chronology protection\nduring mergers, the contribution of supertubes to the charges and angular\nmomenta, and the enhancement of their entropy. In particular, we find that\nentropy enhancement affects supertube fluctuations both along the internal and\nthe spacetime directions, and we prove that the charges that give the enhanced\nentropy can be much larger than the asymptotic charges of the solution. We also\nre-examine the embedding of five-dimensional black rings in Taub-NUT, and show\nthat in different coordinate patches a ring can correspond to different\nfour-dimensional black holes.

The predicted modifications by mobility transport of the\ntime course of the aging regime are modest. In contrast, the rejuvenation\nprocess is strongly affected through the propagation of fronts of enhanced\nmobility originating from the initial reconfiguration events.

We investigate different simple network\nrepresentations by testing how well they encode information about one\nbiologically important network structure -- network modularity (the propensity\nfor edges to be cluster into dense groups that are sparsely connected between\neach other). To reach this goal, we design a model of reaction-systems where\nnetwork modularity can be controlled and measure how well the reduction to\nsimple graphs capture the modular structure of the model reaction system.

Furthermore, we argue that the\nproposed model for reaction systems with tunable clustering is a general\nframework for studies of how reaction-systems are affected by modularity.

We solve the induction equation numerically using a\nhybrid method (spectral in angles, but a finite--differences scheme in the\nradial direction), coupled to the thermal diffusion equation. We present the\nfirst long term 2D simulations of the coupled magneto-thermal evolution of\nneutron stars. This substantially improves previous works in which a very crude\napproximation in at least one of the parts (thermal or magnetic diffusion) has\nbeen adopted. Our results show that the feedback between Joule heating and\nmagnetic diffusion is strong, resulting in a faster dissipation of the stronger\nfields during the first million years of a NS's life. As a consequence, all\nneutron stars born with fields larger than a critical value (about 5 10^13 G)\nreach similar field strengths (approximately 2-3 10^{13} G) at late times.\nIrrespectively of the initial magnetic field strength, after $10^6$ years the\ntemperature becomes so low that the magnetic diffusion timescale becomes longer\nthan the typical ages of radio--pulsars, thus resulting in apparently no\ndissipation of the field in old NS. We also confirm the strong correlation\nbetween the magnetic field and the surface temperature of relatively young NSs\ndiscussed in preliminary works. The effective temperature of models with strong\ninternal toroidal components are systematically higher than those of models\nwith purely poloidal fields, due to the additional energy reservoir stored in\nthe toroidal field that is gradually released as the field dissipates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2008 10:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

Working to linear\norder in the rotation of the star, we consider both the fundamental f-modes and\nthe inertial r-modes. In the case of the (polar) f-modes, we work out an\nanalytic approximation of the mode which allows us to write down a closed\nexpression for the mutual friction damping timescale. The analytic result is in\ngood agreement with previous numerical results obtained using an energy\nintegral argument. We extend previous work by considering the full range of\npermissible values for the vortex drag, e.g. the friction between each\nindividual vortex and the electron fluid. This leads to the first ever results\nfor the f-mode in the strong drag regime. Our estimates provide useful insight\ninto the dependence on, and relevance of, various equation of state parameters.\nIn the case of the (axial) r-modes, we confirm the existence of two classes of\nmodes. However, we demonstrate that only one of these sets remains purely axial\nin more realistic neutron star models. Our analysis lays the foundation for\ncompanion studies of the mutual friction damping of the r-modes at second order\nin the slow-rotation approximation, the first time evolutions for superfluid\nneutron star perturbations and also the first detailed attempt at studying the\ndynamics of superfluid neutron stars with both a relative rotation between the\ncomponents and mutual friction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2008 10:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-30"}

If this is a signature of the donor star, we measure\nK_em=248+/-20 km/s (1sigma confidence) which represents a strict lower limit to\nK_2. Also, the Doppler map of He II lambda4686 shows the characteristic\nsignature of the accretion disk, and there is a hint of enhanced emission that\nmay be a result of tidal distortions in the accretion disk that are expected in\nvery low mass ratio interacting binaries. results: The lower-limit on K_2 leads\nto a lower-limit on the mass function of f(M_1)>0.10M_sun.

We present the\nfirst map of the Balmer temperature and of the temperature fluctuation\nparameter, t^2. We have calculated the t^2 in the plane of the sky, which is\nsubstantially smaller than that determined along the line of sight. We have\nmapped the abundance discrepancy factor of O^{2+}, ADF(O^{2+}), finding its\nmaximum value at the HH 202-S position. We have explored the relations between\nthe ADF(O^{2+}) and the electron density, the Balmer and [O III] temperatures,\nthe ionization degree as well as the t^2 parameter. We do not find clear\ncorrelations between these properties and the results seem to support that the\nADF and t^2 are independent phenomena. We have found a weak negative\ncorrelation between the O^{2+} abundance determined from recombination lines\nand the temperature, which is the expected behaviour in an ionized nebula,\nhence it seems that there is not evidence for the presence of super-metal rich\ndroplets in H II regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2008 12:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our aim is to\nstudy the behavior of the abundance discrepancy problem (ADF) in this type of\nPNe. We measured a large number of optical recombination (ORL) and\ncollisionally excited lines (CEL), from different ionization stages (many more\nthan in any previous work), thus, we were able to derive physical conditions\nfrom many different diagnostic procedures. We determined ionic abundances from\nthe available collisionally excited lines and recombination lines. Based on\nboth sets of ionic abundances, we derived total chemical abundances in the\nnebulae using suitable ionization correction factors. From CELs, we have found\nabundances typical of Galactic disk planetary nebulae. Moderate ADF(O++) were\nfound for PB8 (2.57) and NGC2867 (1.63). For NGC2867, abundances from ORLs are\nhigher but still consistent with Galactic disk planetary nebulae. On the\ncontrary, PB8 presents a very high O/H ratio from ORLs. A high C/O was obtained\nfrom ORLs for NGC2867; this ratio is similar to C/O obtained from CELs and with\nthe chemical composition of the wind of the central star, indicating that there\nwas no further C-enrichment in the star, relative to O, after the nebular\nmaterial ejection.

The\nmass spectrum for M<1 GeV is consistent with a dominant contribution from\npi+pi- -> rho -> mu+mu- annihilation. The associated rho spectral function\nshows a strong broadening, but essentially no shift in mass. For M>1 GeV, the\nexcess is found to be prompt, not due to enhanced charm production, with\npronounced differences to Drell-Yan pairs. The slope parameter Teff associated\nwith the transverse momentum spectra rises with mass up to the rho, followed by\na sudden decline above. The rise for M<1 GeV is consistent with radial flow of\na hadronic emission source. The seeming absence of significant flow for M>1 GeV\nand its relation to parton-hadron duality is discussed in detail, suggesting a\ndominantly partonic emission source in this region.

We present general properties of the ring I_n, as well\nas results obtained by computer exploration for small n, including the\nconstruction of a medium sized generating set for I_5. We address several\nconjectures suggested by those results (low degree system of parameters,\nunimodality), for I_n as well as for more general invariant rings. We also show\nthat some particular sets are not generating, disproving a conjecture of Pouzet\nrelated to reconstruction, as well as a lemma of Grigoriev on the invariant\nring over digraphs. We finally provide a very simple minimal generating set of\nthe field of invariants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2008 15:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-17"}

In this model the asset log-returns are assumed to follow a\njump-diffusion model where the jump component consists of a Levy process of\ncompound Poisson type, while the volatility behavior is described by a\nstochastic differential equation of CIR type, with a mean-reverting drift term\nand a diffusion component correlated with that of the log-returns. Like in all\nthe Levy models, the option pricing problem can be formulated in terms of an\nintegro-differential equation: for the Bates model the unknown F(S, V, t) (the\noption price) of the pricing equation depends on three independent variables\nand the differential operator part turns out to be of parabolic kind, while the\nnonlocal integral operator is calculated with respect to the Levy measure of\nthe jumps. In this paper we will present a variational formulation of the\nproblem suitable for a finite element approach. The numerical results obtained\nfor european options will be compared with those obtained with different\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2008 15:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-17"}
