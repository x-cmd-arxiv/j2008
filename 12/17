The Castor et al. theory over-predicts the X-ray\nluminosity in the Carina bubble by a factor of 60 and expands too rapidly, by a\nfactor of 4; if the correct radius and age are used, the predicted X-ray\nluminosity is even larger. In contrast, the Chevalier & Clegg model\nunder-predicts the X-ray luminosity by a factor of 10. We modify the Castor et\nal. theory to take into account lower stellar wind mass loss rates, radiation\npressure, gravity, and escape of or energy loss from the hot shocked gas. We\nargue that energy is advected rather than radiated from the bubble. We\nundertake a parameter study for reduced stellar mass loss rates and for various\nleakage rates and are able to find viable models. The X-ray surface brightness\nin Carina is highest close to the bubble wall, which is consistent with\nconductive evaporation from cold clouds. The picture that emerges is one in\nwhich the hot gas pressure is far below that found by dividing the\ntime-integrated wind luminosity by the bubble volume; rather, the pressure in\nthe hot gas is set by pressure equilibrium with the photoionized gas at T=10^4\nK. It follows that the shocked stellar winds are not dynamically important in\nforming the bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2008 20:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In fact in dimension D there are [(D-1)/2] commuting\nVirasoro algebras. We consider a general canonical class of near-horizon\ngeometries in arbitrary dimension D, and show that in any such metric, the\n[(D-1)/2] central charges each imply, via the Cardy formula, a microscopic\nentropy that agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the associated\nextremal black hole.

We review here the fundamental role payed\nby both the topology of the underlying surface and its detailed curvature.\nTopology dictates certain broad features of the defect structure of the ground\nstate but curvature-driven energetics controls the detailed structured of\nordered phases. Among the surprises are the appearance in the ground state of\nstructures that would normally be thermal excitations and thus prohibited at\nzero temperature. Examples include excess dislocations in the form of grain\nboundary scars for spherical crystals above a minimal system size, dislocation\nunbinding for toroidal hexatics, interstitial fractionalization in spherical\ncrystals and the appearance of well-separated disclinations for toroidal\ncrystals. Much of the analysis leads to universal predictions that do not\ndepend on the details of the microscopic interactions that lead to order in the\nfirst place. These predictions are subject to test by the many experimental\nsoft and hard matter systems that lead to curved ordered structures such as\ncolloidal particles self-assembling on droplets of one liquid in a second\nliquid. The defects themselves may be functionalized to create ligands with\ndirectional bonding. Thus nano to meso scale superatoms may be designed with\nspecific valency for use in building supermolecules and novel bulk materials.\nParameters such as particle number, geometrical aspect ratios and anisotropy of\nelastic moduli permit the tuning of the precise architecture of the superatoms\nand associated supermolecules. Thus the field has tremendous potential from\nboth a fundamental and materials science/supramolecular chemistry viewpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2008 17:08:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 20:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-31"}

It was suggested that these objects are born as quasars with a high\nintrinsic redshift component that decreases with time. When the intrinsic\ncomponent is large it causes them to be pushed above the standard candle line\nfor brightest radio galaxies on a log(z)-m_{v} plot. In the jets of radio loud\nAGN galaxies, Beta_(app) is the apparent transverse velocity of the ejected\nmaterial relative to the speed of light.

If one adopts the ansatz that regions of the linearly evolved density\nfield smoothed on mass scale M with an overdensity that exceeds the barrier\nwill undergo gravitational collapse into halos of mass M, the corresponding\nabundance of such halos can be estimated simply as a fraction of the mass\ndensity satisfying the collapse criterion divided by the mass M. The key\ningredient of this ansatz is therefore the functional form of the collapse\nbarrier as a function of mass M or, equivalently, of the variance sigma^2(M).\nSeveral such barriers based on the spherical, Zel'dovich, and ellipsoidal\ncollapse models have been extensively discussed. Using large scale cosmological\nsimulations, we show that the relation between the linear overdensity and the\nmass variance for regions that collapse to form halos by the present epoch\nresembles expectations from dynamical models of ellipsoidal collapse. However,\nwe also show that using such a collapse barrier with the excursion set ansatz\npredicts a halo mass function inconsistent with that measured directly in\ncosmological simulations. This inconsistency demonstrates a failure of the\nexcursion set ansatz as a physical model for halo collapse.

First, by removing superfluous mergers that are artifacts of the\nFOF halo finder, we find a lower merger rate compared to previous work. The\nreductions are more significant at lower redshifts, lower halo masses, and\nminor mergers. Our approach agrees better with predictions from the EPS model.\nSecond, we find that the FOF halo finder overestimates the halo mass by up to\n50% for halos that are about to merge, which leads to an additional ~20%\noverestimate of the merger rate. Therefore, we define halo masses by including\nonly gravitationally bound particles. We provide new best-fitting parameters\nfor a global formula to account for these improvements. In addition, we extract\nthe merger rate per progenitor halo, as well as per descendant halo. The former\nis the quantity that is related to observed galaxy merger fractions when they\nare measured via pair counting. At low mass/redshift the merger rate increases\nwith mass and redshift. At high mass/redshift (for halos with masses a few\ntimes the \"knee\" of the mass function) these trends break down, and the merger\nrate per progenitor halo decreases with mass and increases only moderately with\nredshift. Defining the merger rate per progenitor halo also allows us to\nquantify the rate at which halos are being accreted onto larger halos. We\nprovide an analytic formula to convert given merger rates per descendant halo\ninto merger rates per progenitor halo.

We consider the microscopic origin of this transition. Our\napproach consists of the two parts. First, we construct an effective lattice\nfermion model for the manganese 3d-bands and derive parameters of this model\nfrom the first-principles electronic structure calculations. Then, we solve\nthis model in the Hartree-Fock approximation (HFA) and analyze the behavior of\ninteratomic magnetic interactions.

The origin of these interactions is closely related to the orbital\nordering, which takes place in the distorted orthorhombic structure.

Light-front holography allows hadronic amplitudes in\nthe AdS fifth dimension to be mapped to frame-independent light-front\nwavefunctions of hadrons in physical space-time, thus providing a relativistic\ndescription of hadrons at the amplitude level. We identify the AdS coordinate\n$z$ with an invariant light-front coordinate $\\zeta$ which separates the\ndynamics of quark and gluon binding from the kinematics of constituent spin and\ninternal orbital angular momentum. The result is a single-variable light-front\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for QCD which determines the eigenspectrum and the\nlight-front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular\nmomentum. The mapping of electromagnetic and gravitational form factors in AdS\nspace to their corresponding expressions in light-front theory confirms this\ncorrespondence. Some novel features of QCD are discussed, including the\nconsequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates and the behavior of\nthe QCD coupling in the infrared.

Two effects concerning the orbital elements of binary stars are\nconsidered hereafter: the former is the local perspective (LP) effect, which is\ndue to the variation of the distance and of the orientation of the orbital\nplane during the observation time span. The latter effect is the light--travel\ntime (LTT), which is also related to the orientation of the orbital plane.\nTaking these effects into account would allow to find the ascending nodes of\nthe orbits, and lead to orbital elements more accurate than when they are\nignored. It is derived from simulations that, at a distance of 5 pc, and\nassuming velocities typical of Pop.I stars, the position of the right ascending\nnode could be derived for a few simulated unresolved binaries when the\nastrometric measurements have errors around 1 microas. For the resolved brown\ndwarf binary 2MASS J07464256 +2000321, it appears that ignoring the LP effect\nwould result in underestimating the masses of the components by 14 per cent of\nthe errors as soon as the astrometric errors are around 20 microas for each\nmeasurement. However, a `degenerate LP solution', taking into account the\nvariation of the semi-major axis when the distance is varying, should provide\nreliable masses when the measurement errors are larger than 1 or 2 microas. A\nfew binaries in the Gaia program could deserve a degenerate LP solution,\nwhereas a the complete LP+LTT solution could be justified for resolved binaries\nobserved with SIM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2008 09:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

One of the reasons for the slow development of\ntheoretical works in this domain has been the simple power-law behaviour of the\nafterglows hours or days after the prompt gamma-ray emission. Nowadays with the\nlaunch of the Swift satellite, gamma-ray bursts can be observed in\nmulti-wavelength from a few tens of seconds after trigger onward. These\nobservations have leaded to the discovery of features unexplainable by the\nsimple formulation of the shocks and emission processes used up to now. But\n\"devil is in details\" and some of these features may be explained with a more\ndetailed formulation of phenomena and without adhoc addition of new processes.\nSuch a formulation is the goal of this work. We present a consistent\nformulation of the collision between two spherical relativistic shells. The\nmodel can be applied to both internal and external shocks. Notably, we propose\ntwo phenomenological models for the evolution of the emitting region during the\ncollision. One of these models is more suitable for the internal shocks and the\nother for the external collisions. We calculate radiation flux, lags, and\nhardness ratios.

The subsequent substitution of Sr by Pb\nenhances e' to several thousands and induces a ferroelectric phase transition\nto monoclinic Cc phase for x>=3. Its critical temperature Tc linearly depends\non the Pb concentration and reaches 550 K for x=9. The phase transition is of\ndisplacive type. The soft mode frequency follows the Barrett formula in samples\nwith x<=2 (typical for quantum paraelectrics) and the Cochran formula for x>=3.\nThe MW dispersion is lacking and quality factor Q is high in samples with low\nPb concentration, although the permittivity is very high in some cases.\nHowever, due to the lattice softening, the temperature coefficient of the\npermittivity is rather high.

The method provides the nonequilibrium\nphoton distribution from which the effective absorption coefficients and the\nvariable Eddington factor (VEF) can be calculated. The photon distribution\ndepends on the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient, in contrast\nto the distribution obtained by methods based on entropy maximization. The\ncalculated mean absorption coefficients are not only correct in the limit of\noptically thick and thin media, but even provide a reasonable interpolation in\nthe cross-over regime between these limits, notably without introducing any fit\nparameter.

In order to make clear the possible value of such an approach,\nwe briefly review the most important arguments why a straightforward\nperturbative description of finite-temperature QCD is unlikely to be\nsuccessful. From the infrared problems of thermal perturbation theory one can\nconclude that confinement effects and bound states probably play an important\nrole also in the high-temperature phase.\n  To set the stage we recount the supposed role of the Gribov horizon for\nconfinement, before we turn to the application to finite-temperature theory. In\nthe current approach it has been found that the contributions to the free\nenergy from the explicit inclusion of the horizon begin to set in at order\n$g^6$ -- precisely where the infrared problems of thermal QCD lead to a\nbreakdown of ordinary perturbation theory.\n  From the study of observables (free energy, anomaly, bulk viscosity) we also\nnote that for thermodynamic observables the leading order term obtained by such\nan expansion in the coupling strongly deviates from the more complete numerical\nsolution. This can be regarded as yet another sign for general problems of\nseries expansions in thermal QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2008 15:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25"}
