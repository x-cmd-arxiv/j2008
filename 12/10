We constructed the SED from near-IR to centimeter\nwavelengths by adding our millimeter and centimeter data to the available data\nat other wavelengths, mainly Spitzer images. The entire SED was fitted using a\ndisk+envelope model. In addition, we compiled all the disk millimeter\nobservations in the literature and completed a statistical analysis of all the\ndata. We show that the disk mass is usually only a small percentage (less than\n10%) of the mass of the entire envelope in HBe stars. For the disks, there are\nlarge source-to-source variations. Two disks in our sample, R Mon and Z CMa,\nhave similar sizes and masses to those found in T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars.\nThe disks around MWC 1080 and MWC 297 are, however, smaller (rout<100 AU). We\ndid not detect the disks towards MWC 137 and LkHa 215 at millimeter\nwavelengths, which limits the mass and the size of the possible circumstellar\ndisks. A comparison between our data and previous results for T Tauri and\nHerbig Ae stars indicates that although massive disks (0.1 Msun) are found in\nyoung objects (10^4 yr), the masses of the disks around Herbig Be stars are\nusually 5-10 times lower than those around lower mass stars. We propose that\ndisk photoevaporation is responsible for this behavior. In Herbig Be stars, the\nUV radiation disperses the gas in the outer disk on a timescale of a few 10^5\nyr. Once the outer part of the disk has vanished, the entire gaseous disk is\nphotoevaporated on a very short timescale (10^5 yr) and only a small, dusty\ndisk consisting of large grains remains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2008 19:12:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 12:18:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 23:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Since the\nrenormalisability properties of the fermion sector of the model are not yet\nfully known, we work with an effective fermion lagrangian which includes\nnoncommutative higher order terms involving a contraction with the\nnoncommutative $\\theta$ tensor aside from the star products, so that these\nterms annihilate in the commutative limit. Some of these terms violate CPT in\nthe weak sector, and some violate CP in the strong and hypercharge sectors. We\napply this framework to the reevaluation of the decay rates of quarkonia\n(\\bar{q}q_{1} = J/\\psi, \\Upsilon) into two photons. These decays, which are\nforbidden in the ordinary Standard Model, had been previously studied as\npossible signals for noncommutativity, but not in the framework of the better\nbehaved deformed non-minimal version of the noncommutative Standard Model.

If the parameters of the model take natural values, for the vast\nmajority of configurations the resulting branching ratios are enhanced with\nrespect to their values in the minimal version of the noncommutative Standard\nModel.

The heating comes from two\ndistinct sources: gravitational heating from the collapse of the dark matter\nhalo and thermal input from galaxy/black hole formation. However, a long\nstanding problem has been that cosmological simulations based on smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics (SPH) and Eulerian mesh codes predict different results\neven when cooling and galaxy/black hole heating are switched off. Clusters\nformed in SPH simulations show near powerlaw entropy profiles, while those\nformed in mesh simulations develop a core and do not allow gas to reach such\nlow entropies. Since the cooling rate is closely connected to the minimum\nentropy of the gas, the differences are of potentially key importance.\n  In this paper, we investigate the origin of this discrepancy. By comparing\nsimulations run using the GADGET-2 SPH code and the FLASH adaptive Eulerian\nmesh code, we show that the discrepancy arises during the idealised merger of\ntwo clusters. The difference is not sensitive to the resolution of our\nsimulations, nor is it is due differences in the gravity solvers, Galilean\nnon-invariance of the mesh code, or an effect of unsuitable artificial\nviscosity in the SPH code. Instead, we find that the difference is inherent to\nthe treatment of eddies and fluid instabilities. These are suppressed in the\nSPH simulations, while the cluster mergers generate strong vortices in the mesh\nsimulations that efficiently mix the fluid and erase the low entropy gas.\nConsequently, particles in the SPH simulations retain a close connection to\ntheir initial entropy, while this connection is much weaker in the mesh\nsimulations.

We investigate the likeliness\nof two possible hypothesis for its origin: A starspot or a second transiting\nplanet. We made use of several transit observations of TrES-1 from space with\nthe HST and from ground with the IAC-80 telescope. On the basis of these\nobservations we did a statistical study of flux variations in each of the\nobserved events, to investigate if similar flux increases are present in other\nparts of the data set. The HST observation presents a single clear flux rise\nduring a transit whereas the ground observations led to the detection of two\nsuch events but with low significance. In the case of having observed a\nstarspot in the HST data, assuming a central impact between the spot and\nTrES-1, we would obtain a lower limit for the spot radius of 42000 km. For this\nradius the spot temperature would be 4690 K, 560 K lower then the stellar\nsurface of 5250 K. For a putative second transiting planet we can set a lower\nlimit for its radius at 0.37 R$_J$ and for periods of less than 10.5 days, we\ncan set an upper limit at 0.72 R$_J$. Assuming a conventional interpretation,\nthen this HST observation constitutes the detection of a starspot.\nAlternatively, this flux rise might also be caused by an additional transiting\nplanet. The true nature of the origin can be revealed if a wavelength\ndependency of the flux rise can be shown or discarded with a higher certainty.\nAdditionally, the presence of a second planet can also be detected by radial\nvelocity measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2008 21:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Because the stability has an intrinsic dependence on\ntime scales of the graph, it allows us to compare and rank partitions at each\ntime and also to establish the time spans over which partitions are optimal.\nHence the Markov time acts effectively as an intrinsic resolution parameter\nthat establishes a hierarchy of increasingly coarser clusterings. Within our\nframework we can then provide a unifying view of several standard partitioning\nmeasures: modularity and normalized cut size can be interpreted as one-step\ntime measures, whereas Fiedler's spectral clustering emerges at long times. We\napply our method to characterize the relevance and persistence of partitions\nover time for constructive and real networks, including hierarchical graphs and\nsocial networks. We also obtain reduced descriptions for atomic level protein\nstructures over different time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2008 22:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2008 17:42:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2008 15:49:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2009 15:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-18"}

These outer bounds are based on the\nidea of dependence balance which was proposed by Hekstra and Willems [1]. To\nillustrate the usefulness of our outer bounds, we investigate three different\nchannel models. We first consider a Gaussian MAC with noisy feedback (MAC-NF),\nwhere transmitter $k$, $k=1,2$, receives a feedback $Y_{F_{k}}$, which is the\nchannel output $Y$ corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise $Z_{k}$. As the\nfeedback noise variances become large, one would expect the feedback to become\nuseless, which is not reflected by the cut-set bound. We demonstrate that our\nouter bound improves upon the cut-set bound for all non-zero values of the\nfeedback noise variances. Moreover, in the limit as $\\sigma_{Z_{k}}^{2}\\to\n\\infty$, $k=1,2$, our outer bound collapses to the capacity region of the\nGaussian MAC without feedback. Secondly, we investigate a Gaussian MAC with\nuser-cooperation (MAC-UC), where each transmitter receives an additive white\nGaussian noise corrupted version of the channel input of the other transmitter\n[2]. For this channel model, the cut-set bound is sensitive to the cooperation\nnoises, but not sensitive enough. For all non-zero values of cooperation noise\nvariances, our outer bound strictly improves upon the cut-set outer bound.\nThirdly, we investigate a Gaussian IC with user-cooperation (IC-UC).

Therefore,\nthe autoignition of the four isomers of butanol (1-butanol, 2-butanol,\niso-butanol, and tert-butanol) has been experimentally studied at high\ntemperatures in a shock tube and a kinetic mechanism for description of their\nhigh-temperature oxidation has been developed. Ignition delay times for\nbutanol/oxygen/argon mixtures have been measured behind reflected shock waves\nat temperatures and pressures ranging from approximately 1200 to 1800 K and 1\nto 4 bar. Electronically excited OH emission and pressure measurements were\nused to determine ignition delay times. A detailed kinetic mechanism has been\ndeveloped to describe the oxidation of the butanol isomers and validated by\ncomparison to the shock tube measurements. Reaction flux and sensitivity\nanalysis indicate that the consumption of 1 butanol and iso-butanol, the most\nreactive isomers, takes place primarily by H-atom abstraction resulting in the\nformation of radicals, the decomposition of which yields highly reactive\nbranching agents, H-atoms and OH radicals. Conversely, the consumption of tert\nbutanol and 2-butanol, the least reactive isomers, takes place primarily via\ndehydration, resulting in the formation of alkenes, which lead to resonance\nstabilized radicals with very low reactivity. To our knowledge, the ignition\ndelay measurements and oxidation mechanism presented here for 2-butanol,\niso-butanol, and tert butanol are the first of their kind..\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 09:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-11"}

We study static avalanches, or shocks, defined\nhere as jumps between distinct global minima upon changing an external field.\nWe show how the full statistics of these jumps is encoded in the\nfunctional-renormalization-group fixed-point functions. This allows us to\nobtain the size distribution P(S) of static avalanches in an expansion in the\ninternal dimension d of the interface. Near and above d=4 this yields the\nmean-field distribution P(S) ~ S^(-3/2) exp(-S/[4 S_m]) where S_m is a\nlarge-scale cutoff, in some cases calculable.

Our\ncalculation applies to all static universality classes, including random-bond,\nrandom-field and random-periodic disorder. Extended to long-range elastic\nsystems, it yields a different size distribution for the case of contact-line\nelasticity, with an exponent compatible with tau=2-1/(d+zeta) to\nO(epsilon=2-d).

We have performed a systematic study of several\nnanodevices that contain two gate-defined QD's with different shapes and sizes\nlocated between source and drain contacts. The confinement potential is\nmodelled by two potential wells with a variable range and softness. In all the\nconsidered nanodevices, the overall dependence of exchange energy $J$ on\nelectric field $F$ is similar, i.e., for low fields $J$ increases with\nincreasing $F$, for intermediate fields $J$ reaches a maximum, and rapidly\nfalls down to zero if $F$ exceeds a certain critical value. However, the $J(F)$\ndependence shows characteristic properties that depend on the nanodevice\ngeometry. We have found that the low- and intermediate-field behaviour can be\naccurately parametrized by linear function $J(F) = \\\\alpha F + \\\\beta$, where $\nalpha$ is independent of the nanodevice geometry and softness of the\nconfinement potential. We have shown that the linear $J(F)$ dependence appears\nonly if the tunnel coupling between the QD's is weak, i.e., the interdot\nseparation is sufficiently large. The $J(F)$ dependence becomes non-linear for\nthe strong interdot tunnel coupling. If the QD located near the contact, to\nwhich the higher voltage is applied, possesses the elliptic shape and is larger\nthan the other QD, the $J(F)$ dependence shows a plateau in a broad\nelectric-field regime. The linearity and rapid jumps of $J(F)$ as well as the\nexistence of the plateau can be applied to tune the exchange interaction by\nchanging the external electric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 12:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

These observations hence suggest an\nefficient non-thermal ice desorption mechanism. Here, we present experimentally\ndetermined UV photodesorption yields of H2O and D2O ice and deduce their\nphotodesorption mechanism. The ice photodesorption is studied under ultra high\nvacuum conditions and at astrochemically relevant temperatures (18-100 K) using\na hydrogen discharge lamp (7-10.5 eV), which simulates the interstellar UV\nfield. The ice desorption during irradiation is monitored using reflection\nabsorption infrared spectroscopy of the ice and simultaneous mass spectrometry\nof the desorbed species. The photodesorption yield per incident photon is\nidentical for H2O and D2O and depends on both ice thickness and temperature.\nFor ices thicker than 8 monolayers the photodesorption yield Y is linearly\ndependent on temperature due to increased diffusion of ice species such that\nY(T) = 1E-3(1.3+0.032*T) UV photon-1, with a 60% uncertainty for the absolute\nyield. The increased diffusion also results in an increasing H2O:OH desorption\nproduct ratio with temperature. The yield does not depend on the substrate, the\nUV photon flux or the UV fluence. The yield is also independent on the initial\nice structure since UV photons efficiently amorphize H2O ice. The results are\nconsistent with theoretical predictions of H2O photodesorption and partly in\nagreement with a previous experimental study. Applying the experimentally\ndetermined yield to a Herbig Ae/Be star+disk model shows that UV\nphotodesorption of ices increases the H2O content by orders of magnitude in the\ndisk surface region compared to models where non-thermal desorption is ignored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 14:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

An analysis of the size distribution of string loops gives a\nvery low number density, of order 1 per horizon volume, in contrast with\nNambu-Goto simulations. Further, our loop distribution function does not\nsupport the detailed analytic predictions for loop production derived by Dubath\net al. [2].

This appears to be in\nstrong disagreement with the null results of other experiments if interpreted\nin terms of elastic DM scattering, while agreement for a small region of\nparameter space is possible for inelastic DM (iDM) due to the altered\nkinematics of the collision. To date most analyses assume a simple galactic\nhalo DM velocity distribution, the Standard Halo Model, but direct experimental\nsupport for the SHM is severely lacking and theoretical studies indicate\npossible significant differences. We investigate the dependence of DAMA and the\nother direct detection experiments on the local DM velocity distribution,\nutilizing the results of the Via Lactea and Dark Disc numerical simulations. We\nalso investigate effects of varying the solar circular velocity, the DM escape\nvelocity, and the DAMA quenching factor within experimental limits. Our data\nset includes the latest ZEPLIN-III results, as well as full publicly available\ndata sets. Due to the more sensitive dependence of the inelastic cross section\non the velocity distribution, we find that with Via Lactea the DAMA results can\nbe consistent with all other experiments over an enlarged region of iDM\nparameter space, with higher mass particles being preferred, while Dark Disc\ndoes not lead to an improvement. A definitive test of DAMA for iDM requires\nheavy element detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 15:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 17:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 16:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

First, this scale\nmarks the limiting capacity of any information processor. Secondly, by taking\ninto the account the limitations of the quantum information storage in any\nsystem with species, the bound on the gravity cutoff becomes equivalent to the\nholographic bound, and this equivalence automatically implies the equality of\nentanglement and Bekenstein-Hawking entropies. Next, the same bound follows\nfrom quantum cloning theorem. Finally, we point out that by identifying the UV\nand IR threshold scales of the black hole quasi-classicality in\nfour-dimensional field and high-dimensional gravity theories, the bound\ntranslates as the correspondence between the two theories. In case when the\nhigh-dimensional background is AdS, this reproduces the well-known AdS/CFT\nrelation, but also suggests a generalization of the correspondence beyond AdS\nspaces. In particular, it reproduces a recently suggested duality between a\nfour-dimensional CFT and a flat five dimensional theory, in which gravity\ncrosses over from four to five dimensional regime in far infrared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 15:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}
