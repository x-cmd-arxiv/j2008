We discuss PNe abundances in the Galactic bulge and compare\nthese results with those presented in the literature for giant stars. We\npresent the largest, high-quality data-set available for PNe in the direction\nof the Galactic bulge (inner-disk/bulge). For comparison purposes, we also\nconsider a sample of PNe in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We derive the\nelement abundances in a consistent way for all the PNe studied. By comparing\nthe abundances for the bulge, inner-disk, and LMC, we identify elements that\nhave not been modified during the evolution of the PN progenitor and can be\nused to trace the bulge chemical enrichment history. We then compare the PN\nabundances with abundances of bulge field giant. At the metallicity of the\nbulge, we find that the abundances of O and Ne are close to the values for the\ninterstellar medium at the time of the PN progenitor formation, and hence these\nelements can be used as tracers of the bulge chemical evolution, in the same\nway as S and Ar, which are not expected to be affected by nucleosynthetic\nprocesses during the evolution of the PN progenitors.

We\ndiscuss possible reasons for this PNe-giant discrepancy and conclude that this\nis probably due to systematic errors in the abundance derivations in either\ngiants or PNe (or both). We issue an important warning concerning the use of\nabsolute abundances in chemical evolution studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2008 17:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It has recently been studied extensively in scientific databases\nand other settings due to its importance in helping scientists judge data\nvalidity, quality and integrity. However, most models of provenance have been\nstated as ad hoc definitions motivated by informal concepts such as \"comes\nfrom\", \"influences\", \"produces\", or \"depends on\". These models lack clear\nformalizations describing in what sense the definitions capture these intuitive\nconcepts. This makes it difficult to compare approaches, evaluate their\neffectiveness, or argue about their validity.\n  We introduce provenance traces, a general form of provenance for the nested\nrelational calculus (NRC), a core database query language. Provenance traces\ncan be thought of as concrete data structures representing the operational\nsemantics derivation of a computation; they are related to the traces that have\nbeen used in self-adjusting computation, but differ in important respects. We\ndefine a tracing operational semantics for NRC queries that produces both an\nordinary result and a trace of the execution. We show that three pre-existing\nforms of provenance for the NRC can be extracted from provenance traces.\nMoreover, traces satisfy two semantic guarantees: consistency, meaning that the\ntraces describe what actually happened during execution, and fidelity, meaning\nthat the traces \"explain\" how the expression would behave if the input were\nchanged. These guarantees are much stronger than those contemplated for\nprevious approaches to provenance; thus, provenance traces provide a general\nsemantic foundation for comparing and unifying models of provenance in\ndatabases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2008 18:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-03"}

Clusters are\nexpected to emit gamma rays as a result of (1) a population of high-energy\nprimary and re-accelerated secondary cosmic rays (CR) fueled by structure\nformation and merger shocks, active galactic nuclei and supernovae, and (2)\nparticle dark matter (DM) annihilation. In this paper, we ask the question of\nwhether the Fermi telescope will be able to discriminate between the two\nemission processes. We present data-driven predictions for a large X-ray flux\nlimited sample of galaxy clusters and groups. We point out that the gamma ray\nsignals from CR and DM can be comparable. In particular, we find that poor\nclusters and groups are the systems predicted to have the highest DM to CR\nemission at gamma-ray energies. Based on detailed Fermi simulations, we study\nobservational handles that might enable us to distinguish the two emission\nmechanisms, including the gamma-ray spectra, the spatial distribution of the\nsignal and the associated multi-wavelength emissions. We also propose optimal\nhardness ratios, which will help to understand the nature of the gamma-ray\nemission. Our study indicates that gamma rays from DM annihilation with a high\nparticle mass can be distinguished from a CR spectrum even for fairly faint\nsources. Discriminating a CR spectrum from a light DM particle will be instead\nmuch more difficult, and will require long observations and/or a bright source.\nWhile the gamma-ray emission from our simulated clusters is extended,\ndetermining the spatial distribution with Fermi will be a challenging task\nrequiring an optimal control of the backgrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 00:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2009 01:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-14"}

We obtain this result by proving\nthe hardness for a new and surprisingly simple game, the fractional preference\ngame, which is reducible to both fractional BGP and BBC games.\n  We define a new flow-based notion of equilibrium for matrix games --\npersonalized equilibria -- generalizing both fractional BBC and fractional BGP\ngames.

For k-player matrix games, where k = 2, we provide a combinatorial\ncharacterization leading to a polynomial-time algorithm for computing all\npersonalized equilibria.

Some of the remaining baryons are predicted to lie in the warm-hot\nionized medium (WHIM) phase at T=10^5-10^7 K, but the quantity remains a highly\ntunable parameter of the models. Modern UV spectrographs have provided\nunprecedented access to both the Lya forest and potential WHIM tracers at z~0,\nand several independent groups have constructed large catalogs of far-UV IGM\nabsorbers along ~30 AGN sight lines. There is general agreement between the\nsurveys that the warm, photoionized phase makes up ~30% of the baryon budget at\nz~0. Another ~10% can be accounted for in collapsed structures (stars,\ngalaxies, etc.). However, interpretation of the ~100 high-ion (OVI, etc)\nabsorbers at z<0.5 is more controversial. These species are readily created in\nthe shocks expected to exist in the IGM, but they can also be created by\nphotoionization and thus not represent WHIM material. Given several pieces of\nobservational evidence and theoretical expectations, I argue that most of the\nobserved OVI absorbers represent shocked gas at T~300,000 K rather than\nphotoionized gas at T<30,000 K, and they are consequently valid tracers of the\nWHIM phase. Under this assumption, enriched gas at T=10^5-10^6 K can account\nfor ~10% of the baryon budget at z<0.5, but this value may increase when bias\nand incompleteness are taken into account and help close the gap on the 50% of\nthe baryons still \"missing\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2008 21:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

One plausible explanation for the origin of these DMSTOs is\nthat the SCs are composed of two different stellar populations with age\ndifferences of ~ 300 Myr. Based on analytical methods and numerical\nsimulations, we explore a new scenario in which SCs interact and merge with\nstar-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) to form new composite SCs with two\ndistinct component populations. In this new scenario, the possible age\ndifferences between the two different stellar populations responsible for the\nDMSTOs are due largely to secondary star formation within GMCs interacting and\nmerging with already-existing SCs in the LMC disk. The total gas masses being\nconverted into new stars (i.e., the second generation of stars) during GMC-SC\ninteraction and merging can be comparable to or larger than the masses of the\noriginal SCs (i.e, the first generation of stars) in this scenario. Our\nsimulations show that the spatial distributions of new stars in composite SCs\nformed from GMC-SC merging are more compact than those of stars initially in\nthe SCs. We discuss both advantages and disadvantages of the new scenario in\nexplaining fundamental properties of SCs with DMSTOs in the LMC and in the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud (SMC).

We recently introduced a Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit fully triaxial models to weak lensing\ndata that gives parameter and error estimates that fully incorporate the true\nshape uncertainty present in nature.

In this report we apply Pettini's geometrical\nframework to determine the potential energy of a twisted magnetic flux tube,\nfrom its curved Riemannian geometry. Actually the Lyapunov exponents, are\nconnected to a Riemann metric tensor, of the twisted magnetic flux tubes\n(MFTs). The Hamiltonian flow inside the tube is actually given by Perelman\nRicci flows constraints in twisted magnetic flux tubes, where the Lyapunov\neigenvalue spectra for the Ricci tensor associated with the Ricci flow equation\nin MFTs leads to a finite-time Lyapunov exponential stretching along the\ntoroidal direction of the tube and a contraction along the radial direction of\nthe tube. The Jacobi equation for the MFTs is shown to have a constant\nsectional Ricci curvature which allows us to compute the Jacobi-Levi-Civita\n(JLC) geodesic deviation for the spread of lines on the tube manifold and\nchaotic action through the greatest of its Lyapunov exponents. By analyzing the\nspectra of the twisted MFT, it is shown that the greater exponent is positive\nand proportional to the random radial flow of the tube, which allows the onset\nof chaos is guaranted.

Various $f(R)$\ngravity models have been intensively tested against probes of the expansion\nhistory, including type Ia supernovae (SNIa), the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). In this paper we propose to use\nthe statistical lens sample from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Lens Search\nData Release 3 (SQLS DR3) to constrain $f(R)$ gravity models. This sample can\nprobe the expansion history up to $z\\sim2.2$, higher than what probed by\ncurrent SNIa and BAO data. We adopt a typical parameterization of the form\n$f(R)=R-\\alpha H^2_0(-\\frac{R}{H^2_0})^\\beta$ with $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$\nconstants. For $\\beta=0$ ($\\Lambda$CDM), we obtain the best-fit value of the\nparameter $\\alpha=-4.193$, for which the 95% confidence interval that is\n[-4.633, -3.754]. This best-fit value of $\\alpha$ corresponds to the matter\ndensity parameter $\\Omega_{m0}=0.301$, consistent with constraints from other\nprobes. Allowing $\\beta$ to be free, the best-fit parameters are $(\\alpha,\n\\beta)=(-3.777, 0.06195)$. Consequently, we give $\\Omega_{m0}=0.285$ and the\ndeceleration parameter $q_0=-0.544$. At the 95% confidence level, $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ are constrained to [-4.67, -2.89] and [-0.078, 0.202] respectively.\nClearly, given the currently limited sample size, we can only constrain $\\beta$\nwithin the accuracy of $\\Delta\\beta\\sim 0.1$ and thus can not distinguish\nbetween $\\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity with high significance, and actually,\nthe former lies in the 68% confidence contour.

This paper presents a method for calculating the time\nevolution of the habitats' population size distribution from a general\nstochastic dynamic within each habitat, using a deterministic approximation\nwhich becomes exact for an infinite number of habitats. Fragmented populations\nare usually thought to be characterized by a separation of time scale between,\non the one hand, colonization and extinction of habitats and, on the other\nhand, the local population dynamics within each habitat. The analysis in this\npaper suggests an alternative view: the effective population dynamic stems from\na law of large numbers, where stochastic fluctuations in population size of\nsingle habitats are buffered through the dispersal pool so that the global\npopulation dynamic remains approximately smooth. For illustration, the\ndeterministic approximation is compared to simulations of a stochastic model\nwith density dependent local recruitment and mortality.

But some mechanisms have to be proposed to avoid the computation of\nreplicated tasks that can reduce the efficiency and increase the load of nodes.\nIn the same way, these mechanisms have to limit the number of exchanged\nmessages to avoid the overload of the network.\n  In a previous paper, we have proposed two methods for the task management\ncalled active and passive.

This model might be relevant as a description of atomic\nBose gases confined in a one-dimensional geometry. It is known to have a\nfermionic spectrum since the N-body wavefunctions have to vanish at coinciding\npoints, and therefore be symmetrizations of fermionic Slater wavefunctions. We\nargue that in the infinite coupling constant limit the model is\nindistinguishable from free fermions, i.e., all physically accessible\nobservables are the same as those of free fermions. Therefore, Bose-Einstein\ncondensate experiments at finite energy that preserve the one-dimensional\ngeometry cannot test any bosonic characteristic of such a model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 15:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

In this process, usually called\nadiabatic connection, the one-electron density is kept fixed by a suitable\nlocal one-body potential. The strong-interaction limit of density functional\ntheory, defined as the limit $\\lambda\\to\\infty$, turns out to be, like the\nopposite non-interacting Kohn-Sham limit ($\\lambda\\to 0$) mathematically\nsimpler than the physical ($\\lambda=1$) case, and can be used to build an\napproximate interpolation formula between $\\lambda\\to 0$ and $\\lambda\\to\\infty$\nfor the exchange-correlation energy. Here we extend the exact treatment of the\n$\\lambda\\to\\infty$ limit [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 75}, 042511 (2007)] to the next\nleading term, describing zero-point oscillations of strictly correlated\nelectrons, with numerical examples for small spherical atoms. We also propose\nan improved approximate functional for the zero-point term and a revised\ninterpolation formula for the exchange-correlation energy satisfying more exact\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 15:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-05"}

In this paper, we combine the quantum game with the problem of data\nclustering, and then develop a quantum-game-based clustering algorithm, in\nwhich data points in a dataset are considered as players who can make decisions\nand implement quantum strategies in quantum games. After each round of a\nquantum game, each player's expected payoff is calculated. Later, he uses a\nlink-removing-and-rewiring (LRR) function to change his neighbors and adjust\nthe strength of links connecting to them in order to maximize his payoff.\nFurther, algorithms are discussed and analyzed in two cases of strategies, two\npayoff matrixes and two LRR functions. Consequently, the simulation results\nhave demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and\nefficiently, and the clustering algorithms have fast rates of convergence.\nMoreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 15:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2009 09:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
