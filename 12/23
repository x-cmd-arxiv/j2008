A set of well-known basic particle equations\nand properties become predictable based on first principles solutions for the\nIED process; several key solutions achieved are outlined, including the de\nBroglie phase wave, de Broglie relations, Schr\\\"odinger equation, mass,\nEinstein mass-energy relation, Newton's law of gravity, single particle self\ninterference, and electromagnetic radiation and absorption; these equations and\nproperties have long been broadly experimentally validated or demonstrated. A\nspecific solution also predicts the Doebner-Goldin equation which emerges to\nrepresent a form of long-sought quantum wave equation including gravity.

Our main goal here is to uncover the\nrelations between the statistical properties of the node tags and those of the\ngraph topology. In order to better characterise the networks with tagged nodes,\nwe introduce a number of new notions, including tag-assortativity (relating\nlink probability to node similarity), and new quantities, such as node\nuniqueness (measuring how rarely the tags of a node occur in the network) and\ntag-assortativity exponent. We apply our approach to three large networks\nrepresenting very different domains of complex systems. A number of the tag\nrelated quantities display analogous behaviour (e.g., the networks we studied\nare tag-assortative, indicating possible universal aspects of tags versus\ntopology), while some other features, such as the distribution of the node\nuniqueness, show variability from network to network allowing for pin-pointing\nlarge scale specific features of real-world complex networks. We also find that\nfor each network the topology and the tag distribution are scale invariant, and\nthis self-similar property of the networks can be well characterised by the\ntag-assortativity exponent, which is specific to each system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2008 16:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-23"}

As\ntranscription is activated and a G1 phase imposed, the pattern of replication\nadapts to these changes by restricting the sites where DNA synthesis begins.\nRecent evidence indicates that each unit of replication, or replicon, is\nspecified by two or more potential replication origins, but only one is\nselected to initiate replication of the replicon. How the cell distinguishes\nbetween potential origins, and how it selects a given origin of replication\nremain unclear.

We\ncompute the degree of ionization by using self-consistent field theory (SCFT)\nand compare with the previously developed variational theory. Analysis of\nvarious contributions to the free energy in both theories reveals that the\nequilibrium degree of ionization is attained mainly as an interplay of the\nadsorption energy of counterions on the backbone, the translational entropy of\nthe small ions, and their correlated density fluctuations. Degree of ionization\ncomputed from SCFT is significantly lower than that from the variational\nformalism. The difference is entirely due to the density fluctuations of the\nsmall ions in the system, which are accounted for in the variational procedure.\nWhen these fluctuations are deliberately suppressed in the truncated\nvariational procedure, there emerges a remarkable quantitative agreement in the\nvarious contributing factors to the equilibrium degree of ionization, in spite\nof the fundamental differences in the approximations and computational\nprocedures used in these two schemes. Nevertheless, since the significant\neffects from density fluctuations of small ions are not captured by the SCFT,\nand due to the close agreement between SCFT and the other contributing factors\nin the more transparent variational procedure, the latter is a better\ncomputational tool for obtaining the degree of ionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2008 19:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-27"}

We focus here on a limitation of\nsuch models as treated so far in the literature: the force, as it has been\nspecified, is well defined in infinite point distributions only if there is a\ncentre of symmetry (i.e. the definition requires explicitly the breaking of\nstatistical translational invariance). The problem arises because naive\nbackground subtraction (due to expansion, or by \"Jeans' swindle\" for the static\ncase), applied as in three dimensions, leaves an unregulated contribution to\nthe force due to surface mass fluctuations. Following a discussion by\nKiessling, we show that the problem may be resolved by defining the force in\ninfinite point distributions as the limit of an exponentially screened pair\ninteraction. We show that this prescription gives a well defined (finite) force\nacting on particles in a class of perturbed infinite lattices, which are the\npoint processes relevant to cosmological N-body simulations. For identical\nparticles the dynamics of the simplest toy model is equivalent to that of an\ninfinite set of points with inverted harmonic oscillator potentials which\nbounce elastically when they collide. We discuss previous results in the\nliterature, and present new results for the specific case of this simplest\n(static) model starting from \"shuffled lattice\" initial conditions.

Assuming that the extra\ndimensions are compact spaces of constant curvature, General Relativity is\nrecovered within certain class of Lovelock theories possessing necessarily\ncubic or higher order terms in curvature. This bounds the higher dimension to\nbe at least seven. Remarkably, the effective gauge coupling and Newton constant\nin four dimensions are not proportional to the gravitational constant in higher\ndimensions, but shifted with respect to their standard values. This effect\nopens up new scenarios where a maximally symmetric solution in higher\ndimensions could decay into the compactified spacetime either by tunneling or\nthrough a gravitational analogue of ghost condensation.

The manifestation of a FM state in TbCo2B2C is unique among all\nother isomorphous borocarbides, in particular TbNi2B2C (Tn=15 K, incommensurate\nmodulated magnetic state) even though the Tb-ions in both isomorphs have almost\nthe same crystalline electric field properties. The difference in the magnetic\nmodes of these Tb-based isomorphs is attributed to a difference in their\nexchange couplings caused by a variation in their lattice parameters and in the\nposition of their Fermi levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2008 03:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-24"}

In this study, we test the results of two recently\navailable algorithms for the decomposition of large matrices against two\ncontent-based classifications of journals: the ISI Subject Categories and the\nfield/subfield classification of Glaenzel & Schubert (2003). The content-based\nschemes allow for the attribution of more than a single category to a journal,\nwhereas the algorithms maximize the ratio of within-category citations over\nbetween-category citations in the aggregated category-category citation matrix.\nBy adding categories, indexers generate between-category citations, which may\nenrich the database, for example, in the case of inter-disciplinary\ndevelopments. The consequent indexer effects are significant in sparse areas of\nthe matrix more than in denser ones. Algorithmic decompositions, on the other\nhand, are more heavily skewed towards a relatively small number of categories,\nwhile this is deliberately counter-acted upon in the case of content-based\nclassifications. Because of the indexer effects, science policy studies and the\nsociology of science should be careful when using content-based\nclassifications, which are made for bibliographic disclosure, and not for the\npurpose of analyzing latent structures in scientific communications. Despite\nthe large differences among them, the four classification schemes enable us to\ngenerate surprisingly similar maps of science at the global level.

Indeed,\nfor two probabilistically independent subsystems, it satisfies\n$S_q(A+B)/k=[S_q(A)/k]+[S_q(B)/k]+(1-q)[S_q(A)/k][S_q(B)/k] \\ne\nS_q(A)/k+S_q(B)/k$. This form will turn out to be {\\it extensive} for an\nimportant class of nonlocal correlations, if $q$ is set equal to a special\nvalue different from unity, noted $q_{ent}$ (where $ent$ stands for $entropy$).\nIn other words, for such systems, we verify that $S_{q_{ent}}(N) \\propto N\n(N>>1)$, thus legitimating the use of the classical thermodynamical relations.\nStandard systems, for which $S_{BG}$ is extensive, obviously correspond to\n$q_{ent}=1$. Quite complex systems exist in the sense that, for them, no value\nof $q$ exists such that $S_q$ is extensive. Such systems are out of the present\nscope: they might need forms of entropy different from $S_q$, or perhaps --\nmore plainly -- they are just not susceptible at all for some sort of\nthermostatistical approach. Consistently with the results associated with\n$S_q$, the $q$-generalizations of the Central Limit Theorem and of its extended\nL\\'evy-Gnedenko form have been achieved. These recent theorems could of course\nbe the cause of the ubiquity of $q$-exponentials, $q$-Gaussians and related\nmathematical forms in natural, artificial and social systems. All of the above,\nas well as presently available experimental, observational and computational\nconfirmations -- in high energy physics and elsewhere --, are briefly reviewed.\nFinally, we address a confusion which is quite common in the literature, namely\nreferring to distinct physical mechanisms {\\it versus} distinct regimes of a\nsingle physical mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2008 11:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

This simple model when analyzed properly in\nquantum field theory shows many interesting facets and helps to dispel some\nmisunderstandings of entanglement dynamics. We find that there is spatial\ndependence of quantum entanglement in the stable regime due to the phase\ndifference of vacuum fluctuations the two detectors experience, together with\nthe interference of the mutual influences from the backreaction of one detector\non the other. When two initially entangled detectors are still outside each\nother's light cone, the entanglement oscillates in time with an amplitude\ndependent on spatial separation $d$. When the two detectors begin to have\ncausal contact, an interference pattern of the relative degree of entanglement\n(compared to those at spatial infinity) develops a parametric dependence on\n$d$. The detectors separated at those $d$ with a stronger relative degree of\nentanglement enjoy longer disentanglement times. In the cases with weak\ncoupling and large separation, the detectors always disentangle at late times.\nFor sufficiently small $d$, the two detectors can have residual entanglement\neven if they initially were in a separable state, while for $d$ a little\nlarger, there could be transient entanglement created by mutual influences.\nHowever, we see no evidence of entanglement creation outside the light cone for\ninitially separable states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2008 14:27:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 13:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

The\nExtended ADC emission model provides very good fits to the spectra, the results\npointing clearly to a model for the nature of the Z-track, in agreement with\nprevious results for the similar source GX 340+0. In this model, at the soft\napex of the Z-track, the mass accretion rate Mdot is minimum and the neutron\nstar has its lowest temperature; but as the source moves along the normal\nbranch, the luminosity of the Comptonized emission increases, indicating that\nMdot increases and the neutron star gets hotter. The measured flux f of the\nneutron star emission increases by a factor of ten becoming super-Eddington,\nand we propose that this disrupts the inner disk so forming jets. In flaring,\nthe luminosity of the dominant Comptonized emission from the ADC is constant,\nwhile the neutron star emission increases, and we propose for the first time\nthat flaring consists of unstable nuclear burning on the neutron star, and the\nmeasured mass accretion rate per unit area mdot at the onset of flaring agrees\nwell with the theoretical critical value at which burning becomes unstable.\nThere is a striking correlation between the frequencies of the kHz QPO and the\nratio of the flux to the Eddington value: f/f_Edd, suggesting an explanation of\nthe higher frequency QPO and of its variation along the Z-track. It is well\nknown that a Keplerian orbit in the disk at this frequency corresponds to a\nposition some distance from the neutron star; we propose that the oscillation\nalways occurs at the inner disk edge, which moves radially outwards on the\nupper normal and horizontal branches as the measured increasing radiation\npressure increasingly disrupts the inner disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2008 15:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We have grown single crystals of CaV2O4 and report\ncrystallography, static magnetization, magnetic susceptibility \\chi, ac\nmagnetic susceptibility, heat capacity Cp, and thermal expansion measurements\nin the temperature T range of 1.8-350 K on the single crystals and on\npolycrystalline samples. An orthorhombic to monoclinic structural distortion\nand a long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) transition were found at\nsample-dependent temperatures T_S \\approx 108-145 K and T_N \\approx 51-76 K,\nrespectively. In two annealed single crystals, another transition was found at\n\\approx 200 K. In one of the crystals, this transition is mostly due to V2O3\nimpurity phase that grows coherently in the crystals during annealing. However,\nin the other crystal the origin of this transition at 200 K is unknown. The\n\\chi(T) shows a broad maximum at \\approx 300 K associated with short-range AF\nordering and the anisotropy of \\chi above T_N is small. The anisotropic \\chi(T\n\\to 0) data below T_N show that the (average) easy axis of the AF magnetic\nstructure is the b-axis. The Cp(T) data indicate strong short-range AF ordering\nabove T_N, consistent with the \\chi(T) data. We fitted our \\chi(T) data near\nroom temperature by a J1-J2 S = 1 Heisenberg chain model, where J1(J2) is the\n(next)-nearest-neighbor exchange interaction. We find J1 \\approx 230 K, and\nsurprisingly, J2/J1 \\approx 0 (or J1/J2 \\approx 0). The interaction J_\\perp\nbetween these S = 1 chains leading to long-range AF ordering at T_N is\nestimated to be J_\\perp/J_1 \\gtrsim 0.04.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2008 15:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
