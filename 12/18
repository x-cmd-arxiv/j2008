Even though samples are\ngrowing at redshifts z = 3 - 6, the nature of these galaxies is still poorly\nknown. Aims: To study the properties of z = 2.25 LAEs and compare those with\nthe properties of z > 3 LAEs. Methods: We present narrow-band imaging made with\nthe MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope with the WFI detector. We have made a selection for\nemission-line objects and find 170 candidate typical LAEs and 17 candidates\nwhich we regard as high UV-transmission LAEs. We have derived the magnitudes of\nthese objects in 8 bands from u* to Ks, and studied if they have X-ray and/or\nradio counterparts. Results: We show that there has been significant evolution\nin the properties of LAEs between redshift z ~ 3 and z = 2.25. The spread in\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the lower redshift is larger and we\ndetect a significant AGN contribution in the sample. The distribution of the\nequivalent widths is narrower than at z ~ 3, with only a few candidates with\nrest-frame equivalent width above the predicted limit of 240 A. The star\nformation rates derived from the Ly-alpha emission compared to that derived\nfrom the UV emission are lower by on average a factor of ~ 1.8, indicating a\nlarge absorption of dust. Conclusion: LAEs at redshift z = 2.25 may be more\nevolved than LAEs at higher redshift. The red SEDs imply more massive, older\nand/or more dusty galaxies at lower redshift than observed at higher redshifts.\nThe decrease in equivalent widths and star formation rates indicate more\nquiescent galaxies, with in general less star formation than in higher redshift\ngalaxies. At z = 2.25, AGN appear to be more abundant and also to contribute\nmore to the LAE population.

Despite the fact that the parameter range for F-theory GUT\nmodels is very narrow, we find that F-theory GUTs beautifully satisfy most\ncosmological constraints without any further restrictions. The viability of the\nscenario hinges on the interplay between various components of the axion\nsupermultiplet, which in F-theory GUTs is also responsible for breaking\nsupersymmetry. In these models, the gravitino is the LSP and develops a mass by\neating the axino mode. The radial component of the axion supermultiplet known\nas the saxion typically begins to oscillate in the early Universe, eventually\ncoming to dominate the energy density. Its decay reheats the Universe to a\ntemperature of ~ 1 GeV, igniting BBN and diluting all thermal relics such as\nthe gravitino by a factor of ~ 10^(-4) - 10^(-5) such that gravitinos\ncontribute a sizable component of the dark matter. In certain cases,\nnon-thermally produced relics such as the axion, or gravitinos generated from\nthe decay of the saxion can also contribute to the abundance of dark matter.\nRemarkably enough, this cosmological scenario turns out to be independent of\nthe initial reheating temperature of the Universe. This is due to the fact that\nthe initial oscillation temperature of the saxion coincides with the freeze out\ntemperature for gravitinos in F-theory GUTs. We also find that saxion dilution\nis compatible with generating the desired baryon asymmetry from standard\nleptogenesis. Finally, the gravitino mass range in F-theory GUTs is 10-100 MeV,\nwhich interestingly coincides with the window of values required for the decay\nof the NLSP to solve the problem of Li(7) over-production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2008 17:26:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 23:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2009 21:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The Aly-Sturrock conjecture states that the magnetic energy of a given\nforce free boundary field is maximized when the field is open. This is\nproblematic for CME initiation because it leaves little or no magnetic energy\nto drive the eruption, unless reconnection is present to allow some of the\nfield to escape without opening. Thus, it has been thought that reconnection\nmust be present to initiate CMEs. This theory has not been subject to rigorous\nnumerical testing because conventional MHD numerical models contain numerical\ndiffusion, which introduces uncontrolled numerical reconnection. We use a\nquasi-Lagrangian simulation technique to run the first controlled experiments\nof CME initiation in the complete lack of reconnection. We find that a flux\nrope confined by an arcade, when twisted beyond a critical amount, can escape\nto an open state, allowing some of the surrounding arcade to shrink and\nreleasing magnetic energy from the global field. This mechanism includes a true\nideal MHD instability.

In the second\ngeometry, the current is parallel to both the polarizing magnet/nonmagnet and\nnonmagnet/switching magnet interfaces (CIP). Calculations for a single-orbital\ntight binding model indicate that the spin current flowing parallel to the\nswitching magnet/nonmagnet interface can be absorbed by a lateral switching\nmagnet as efficiently as in the traditional current-perpendicular-to-plane\n(CPP) geometry. The results of the model calculations are shown to be valid\nalso for experimentally relevant Co/Cu CPIP system described by fully realistic\ntight binding bands fitted to an ab initio band structure.

Thanks to the performances of the INTEGRAL Burst\nAlert System, 50% of the IBIS GRBs have detected afterglows, while 5% have\nredshift measurements. A spectral analysis of the 43 bursts in the INTEGRAL\npublic archive has been carried out using the most recent software and\ncalibration, deriving an updated, homogeneous and accurate catalogue with the\nspectral features of the sample. When possible also a time-resolved spectral\nanalysis has been carried out.

Using the\nrevised spectral parameters and an updated sky exposure map that takes into\naccount also the effects of the GRB trigger efficiency, we strengthen the\nevidence for a spatial correlation with the super galactic plane of the faint\nbursts with long spectral lag (Foley et al.,2008).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2008 17:32:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 12:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Recently there has been major progress in\nunderstanding the nature of the bright SMGs (i.e. S(850um)>5mJy). The samples\nfor the fainter SMGs are small and are currently in a phase of being built up\nthrough identification studies. Aims: We study the molecular gas content in two\nSMGs, SMMJ163555 and SMMJ163541, at z=1.034 and z=3.187 with unlensed submm\nfluxes of 0.4mJy and 6.0mJy. Both SMGs are gravitationally lensed by the\nforeground cluster A2218. Methods: IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometry\nobservations at 3mm were obtained for the lines CO(2-1) for SMMJ163555 and\nCO(3-2) for SMMJ163541. Additionally we obtained CO(4-3) for the candidate\nz=4.048 SMMJ163556 with an unlensed submm flux of 2.7mJy. Results: CO(2-1) was\ndetected for SMMJ163555 at z=1.0313 with an integrated line intensity of\n1.2+-0.2Jy km/s and a line width of 410+-120 km/s. From this a gas mass of\n1.6x10^9 Msun is derived and a star formation efficiency of 440Lsun/Msun is\nestimated. CO(3-2) was detected for SMMJ163541 at z=3.1824, possibly with a\nsecond component at z=3.1883, with an integrated line intensity of 1.0+-0.1 Jy\nkm/s and a line width of 280+-50 km/s. From this a gas mass of 2.2x10^10 Msun\nis derived and a star formation efficiency of 1000 Lsun/Msun is estimated. For\nSMMJ163556 the CO(4-3) is undetected within the redshift range 4.035-4.082 down\nto a sensitivity of 0.15 Jy km/s. Conclusions: Our CO line observations confirm\nthe optical redshifts for SMMJ163555 and SMMJ163541. The CO line luminosity\nL'_CO for both galaxies is consistent with the L_FIR-L'_CO relation. SMMJ163555\nhas the lowest FIR luminosity of all SMGs with a known redshift and is one of\nthe few high redshift LIRGs whose properties can be estimated prior to ALMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2008 21:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Such transient states\nare typically of low population in simulation samples. Even for simple systems\nsuch as RNA hairpins, recently there are mounting debates over the existence of\nmultiple intermediate states. In this paper, we develop a computational\napproach to explore the relatively low populated transition or intermediate\nstates in biomolecular folding pathways, based on a topological data analysis\ntool, Mapper, with simulation data from large-scale distributed computing. The\nmethod is inspired by the classical Morse theory in mathematics which\ncharacterizes the topology of high dimensional shapes via some functional level\nsets. In this paper we exploit a conditional density filter which enables us to\nfocus on the structures on pathways, followed by clustering analysis on its\nlevel sets, which helps separate low populated intermediates from high\npopulated uninteresting structures. A successful application of this method is\ngiven on a motivating example, a RNA hairpin with GCAA tetraloop, where we are\nable to provide structural evidence from computer simulations on the multiple\nintermediate states and exhibit different pictures about unfolding and\nrefolding pathways. The method is effective in dealing with high degree of\nheterogeneity in distribution, capturing structural features in multiple\npathways, and being less sensitive to the distance metric than nonlinear\ndimensionality reduction or geometric embedding methods. It provides us a\nsystematic tool to explore the low density intermediate states in complex\nbiomolecular folding systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2008 22:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Heuristic scaling arguments\nbased on random walk properties show that the typical cluster size scales as\n(t/ln(t))^z, with z=1/(k+2). The initial symmetric flux of particles between\nneighboring clusters is followed by an effectively assymmetric flux due to the\nunbalanced detachement rates, which leads to the above logarithmic correction.\nSmall clusters have densities of order t^{-mz(1)}, with z(1) = k/(k+2). Thus,\nfor k<1, the small clusters (mass of order unity) are statistically dominant\nand the average cluster size does not scale as the size of typically large\nclusters does. We also solve the Master equation of the model under an\nindependent interval approximation, which yields cluster distributions and\nexponent relations and gives the correct dominant coarsening exponent after\naccounting for the effects of correlations. The coarsening of large clusters is\ndescribed by the distribution P_t(m) ~ 1/t^y f(m/t^z), with y=2z. All results\nare confirmed by simulation, which also illustrates the unusual features of\ncluster size distributions, with a power law decay for small masses and a\nnegatively skewed peak in the scaling region.

At all ranges\nof SINR, completion time minimization can be formulated as a convex\noptimization problem and hence can be efficiently solved. In particular,\nalthough the feasible rate region of the wireless network is non-convex, its\ncorresponding completion time region is shown to be convex. When channel\nknowledge is imperfect, robust power control is considered based on the channel\nfading distribution subject to outage probability constraints. The problem is\nshown to be convex when the fading distribution is log-concave in exponentiated\nchannel power gains; e.g., when each user is under independent Rayleigh,\nNakagami, or log-normal fading. Applying the optimization frameworks in a\nwireless cellular network, the average completion time is significantly reduced\nas compared to full power transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 02:30:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 05:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-06"}

The main prediction back then, was\nthe existence of disorder induced localized states, which do not conduct\nelectricity. Many years later it turns out, that the concept of Anderson\nlocalization is much more general and applies to almost any type of propagation\nin time or space, when more than one parameter is relevant (like phase and\namplitude). Here we propose a new optical scheme to literally see Anderson\nlocalization by varying the optical wavelength or angle of incidence to tune\nbetween localized and delocalized states. The occurrence of Anderson\nlocalization in the propagation of light, in particular, has become the focus\nof tremendous interest due to the emergence of new optical technologies and\nmedia, such as low dimensional and disordered optical lattices. While several\nexperiments have reported the measurement of Anderson localization of light,\nmany of the observations remain controversial because the effects of absorption\nand localization have a similar signature, i.e., exponential decrease of the\ntransmission with the system size. In this work, we discuss a system, where we\ncan clearly differentiate between absorption and localization effects because\nthis system is equivalent to a perfect filter, only in the absence of any\nabsorption. Indeed, only one wavelength is perfectly transmitted and all others\nare fully localized.

The typical velocity of dust grain as a function of\ngrain size has been calculated for various ISM phases based on a theory of\ngrain dynamics in compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. In this paper,\nwe develop a scheme of grain shattering and coagulation and apply it to\nturbulent ISM by using the grain velocities predicted by the above turbulence\ntheory. Since large grains tend to acquire large velocity dispersions as shown\nby earlier studies, large grains tend to be shattered. Large shattering effects\nare indeed seen in warm ionized medium (WIM) within a few Myr for grains with\nradius $a\\ga 10^{-6}$ cm. We also show that shattering in warm neutral medium\n(WNM) can limit the largest grain size in ISM ($a\\sim 2\\times 10^{-5}\n\\mathrm{cm}$). On the other hand, coagulation tends to modify small grains\nsince it only occurs when the grain velocity is small enough. Coagulation\nsignificantly modifies the grain size distribution in dense clouds (DC), where\na large fraction of the grains with $a<10^{-6}$ cm coagulate in 10 Myr. In\nfact, the correlation among $R_V$, the carbon bump strength, and the\nultraviolet slope in the observed Milky Way extinction curves can be explained\nby the coagulation in DC. It is possible that the grain size distribution in\nthe Milky Way is determined by a combination of all the above effects of\nshattering and coagulation.

Our approach takes into account\nnot only the anisotropy of the continuum radiation, but also the\nsymmetry-breaking effects caused by the horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities\nproduced by the solar surface convection. Interestingly, our radiative transfer\nmodeling in a well-known 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere shows\nremarkable agreement with the empirical data, significantly better than that\nobtained via the use of 1D atmospheric models. Although this result confirms\nthat the above-mentioned 3D model was indeed a suitable choice for our\nHanle-effect estimation of the substantial amount of \"hidden\" magnetic energy\nthat is stored in the quiet solar photosphere, we have found however some small\ndiscrepancies whose origin may be due to uncertainties in the empirical data\nand/or in the thermal and density structure of the 3D model. For this reason,\nwe have paid some attention also to other (more familiar) observables, like the\ncenter-limb variation of the continuum intensity, which we have calculated\ntaking into account the scattering contribution to the continuum source\nfunction. The overall agreement with the observed center-limb variation turns\nout to be impressive, but we find a hint that the model's temperature gradients\nin the continuum forming layers could be slightly too steep, perhaps because\nall current simulations of solar surface convection and magnetoconvection\ncompute the radiative flux divergence ignoring the fact that the effective\npolarizability is not completely negligible, especially in the downward-moving\nintergranular lane plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 09:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The estimates of the\nallometric scaling exponent b linking body mass and metabolic rate indicated no\ninterspecific difference and resulted in a value of 0.696 +/- 0.105 (mean +/-\n95% CI). In contrast, the four best-supported nlm models suggested that both\nthe scaling exponent and activation energy significantly vary across the high\nrank taxa to which species belong, with mean values of b ranging from about 0.6\nto 0.8.

In this paper, we investigate the\naveraged null energy condition in LQC in the framework of effective\nHamiltonian, and find out that LQC do violate the averaged null energy\ncondition in the massless scalar field coupled model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 13:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}

The recent release of five years\nof WMAP observations have confirmed the general picture of the primordial power\nspectrum as deviating slightly from scale invariance with a spectral tilt\nparameter of n_s ~ 0.96. Nonetheless, many attempts have been made to isolate\nfurther features such as breaks and cutoffs using a variety of methods, some\nemploying more than ~ 10 varying parameters. In this paper we apply the robust\ntechnique of Bayesian model selection to reconstruct the optimal degree of\nstructure in the spectrum.

The number of nodes and their k-space positions are chosen by\nthe Bayesian evidence so that we can identify both the complexity and location\nof any detected features. Our optimal reconstruction contains, perhaps,\nsurprisingly few features, the data preferring just three nodes. This\nreconstruction allows for a degree of scale dependence of the tilt with the\n`turn-over' scale occuring around k ~ 0.016 Mpc^{-1}. More structure is\npenalised by the evidence as over-fitting the data, so there is currently\nlittle point in attempting reconstructions that are more complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 14:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We find the impact to be small but still not negligible. In\nparticular, if recombination is non-standard (to a level still allowed by CMB\ndata), but this is ignored, future surveys may incorrectly suggest the presence\nof a redshift dependent dark energy component. On the other hand, in the case\nof delayed recombination, adding to the analysis one extra parameter describing\ndeviations from standard recombination, does not significantly degrade the\nerror-bars on dark energy parameters and yields unbiased estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 15:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-20"}

We start from a fractal structure generated by the DLCA-DEF\nalgorithm, onto which we then impose an interaction potential consisting of a\nshort-range attraction as well as a long-range repulsion. After relaxing the\nsystem at T=0, we let it evolve at a fixed finite temperature. Depending on the\ntemperature T we find different scenarios for the aging behavior. For T>0.2 the\nfractal structure is unstable and breaks up into small clusters which relax to\nequilibrium. For T<0.2 the structure is stable and the dynamics slows down with\nincreasing waiting time. At intermediate and low T the mean squared\ndisplacement scales as t^{2/3} and we discuss several mechanisms for this\nanomalous time dependence. For intermediate T, the self-intermediate scattering\nfunction is given by a compressed exponential at small wave-vectors and by a\nstretched exponential at large wave-vectors. In contrast, for low T it is a\nstretched exponential for all wave-vectors. This behavior can be traced back to\na subtle interplay between elastic rearrangements, fluctuations of chain-like\nfilaments, and heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 15:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-19"}
