Active particles perform\nrandom walks without interaction, and they may as well change their state to\npassive, then stopping to jump. When particles of both types occupy the same\nsite, they all become active. This model exhibits phase transition in the sense\nthat for low initial densities the system locally fixates and for high\ndensities it keeps active. Though extensively studied in the physics\nliterature, the matter of giving a mathematical proof of such phase transition\nremained as an open problem for several years. In this work we identify some\nvariables that are sufficient to characterize fixation and at the same time are\nstochastically monotone in the model's parameters. We employ an explicit\ngraphical representation in order to obtain the monotonicity. With this method\nwe prove that there is a unique phase transition for the one-dimensional\nfinite-range random walk. Joint with V. Sidoravicius.\n  * BROKEN LINE PROCESS * We introduce the broken line process and derive some\nof its properties. Its discrete version is presented first and a natural\ngeneralization to the continuum is then proposed and studied. The broken lines\nare related to the Young diagram and the Hammersley process and are useful for\ncomputing last passage percolation values and finding maximal oriented paths.\nFor a class of passage time distributions there is a family of boundary\nconditions that make the process stationary and reversible. One application is\na simple proof of the explicit law of large numbers for last passage\npercolation with exponential and geometric distributions. Joint with V.\nSidoravicius, D. Surgailis, and M.

The addition of an on-board digital\nreceiver would allow the up- and down-link Doppler frequencies to be measured\nseparately. Such separate, high-quality measurements allow optimal data\ncombinations that suppress the currently-leading noise sources: phase\nscintillation noise from the Earth's atmosphere and Doppler noise caused by\nmechanical vibrations of the ground antenna. Here we provide a general\nexpression for the optimal combination of ground and on-board Doppler data and\ncompute the sensitivity such a system would have to low-frequency gravitational\nwaves (GWs). Assuming a plasma scintillation noise calibration comparable to\nthat already demonstrated with the multi-link CASSINI radio system, the\nspace-clock/digital-receiver instrumentation enhancements would give GW strain\nsensitivity of $2.0 \\times 10^{-17}$ for randomly polarized, monochromatic GW\nsignals over a two-decade ($\\sim0.0001-0.01$ Hz) region of the low-frequency\nband.

The utility of optimally\ncombining simultaneous up- and down-link observations is not limited to GW\nsearches. The Doppler tracking technique discussed here could be performed at\nminimal incremental cost to also improve other radio science experiments (i.e.\ntests of relativistic gravity, planetary and satellite gravity field\nmeasurements, atmospheric and ring occultations) on future interplanetary\nmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2008 20:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

This idea\nseems to result as an unavoidable conclusion from some simple experiments. In\nits original form, Hardy's thought-experiment was proposed for two independent\nparticles, a positron and an electron. The two either meet and annihilate, or\ndon't meet but become entangled. An important feature of entanglements with\nparticles that never meet is the difficulty they raise in front of the\nassumption of \"hidden communication\" between the particles. Indeed, if the\nparticles don't meet, they can't have information of one another and it is\ndifficult to explain how can they communicate. In order to implement Hardy's\nparadox with particles that never meet, the present article proposes to use\nphotons from three different lasers, one laser emitting UV rays, and the other\ntwo emitting at the wavelength of the signal photon, respectively the idler\nphoton obtained from the down-conversion of the UV rays. The role of the\nannihilation in Hardy's experiment will be played by the destructive\ninterference between a down-conversion pair and two photons from the low-energy\nlasers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2008 20:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-16"}

When compared with 2MASS Ks band\nluminosities, lenticular (S0) galaxies exhibit a much wider range of mid to\nfar-infrared luminosities then elliptical (E) galaxies. Mid and far-infrared\nemission from E galaxies is a combination of circumstellar or interstellar\nemission from local mass-losing red giant stars, dust buoyantly transported\nfrom the galactic cores into distant hot interstellar gas and dust accreted\nfrom the environment. The source of mid and far-IR emission in S0 galaxies is\nquite different and is consistent with low levels of star formation, 0.02 - 0.2\nMsol/yr, in cold, dusty gaseous disks. The infrared 24micron-70micron color is\nsystematically lower for (mostly S0) galaxies with known molecular disks. Our\nobservations support the conjecture that cold dusty gas in some S0 galaxies is\ncreated by stellar mass loss at approximately the same rate that it is consumed\nby star formation, so the mass depletion of these disks by star formation will\nbe slow. Unlike E galaxies, the infrared luminosities of S0 galaxies correlate\nwith both the mass of molecular gas and the stellar Hbeta spectral index, and\nall are related to the recent star formation rate. However, star formation\nrates estimated from the Hbeta emission line luminosities L_{Hbeta} in SAURON\nS0 galaxies are generally much smaller. Since L_{Hbeta} does not correlate with\n24 microns emission from dust heated by young stars, optical emission lines\nappear to be a poor indicator of star formation rates in SAURON S0 galaxies.\nThe absence of Hbeta emission may be due to a relative absence of OB stars in\nthe initial mass function or to dust absorption of Hbeta emission lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2008 00:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Under his framework, the theoretical optimal allocation\nvector can be very different from the estimated one for large portfolios due to\nthe intrinsic difficulty of estimating a vast covariance matrix and return\nvector. This can result in adverse performance in portfolio selected based on\nempirical data due to the accumulation of estimation errors. We address this\nproblem by introducing the gross-exposure constrained mean-variance portfolio\nselection. We show that with gross-exposure constraint the theoretical optimal\nportfolios have similar performance to the empirically selected ones based on\nestimated covariance matrices and there is no error accumulation effect from\nestimation of vast covariance matrices. This gives theoretical justification to\nthe empirical results in Jagannathan and Ma (2003). We also show that the\nno-short-sale portfolio is not diversified enough and can be improved by\nallowing some short positions. As the constraint on short sales relaxes, the\nnumber of selected assets varies from a small number to the total number of\nstocks, when tracking portfolios or selecting assets. This achieves the optimal\nsparse portfolio selection, which has close performance to the theoretical\noptimal one. Among 1000 stocks, for example, we are able to identify all\noptimal subsets of portfolios of different sizes, their associated allocation\nvectors, and their estimated risks. The utility of our new approach is\nillustrated by simulation and empirical studies on the 100 Fama-French\nindustrial portfolios and the 400 stocks randomly selected from Russell 3000.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2008 06:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-16"}

To understand these models, we should\nlike to know when different kernels $\\ka$ give rise to `similar' graphs, and,\ngiven a real-world network, how `similar' is it to a typical graph $G(n,\\ka)$\nderived from a given kernel $\\ka$.\n  The analogous questions for dense graphs, with $\\Theta(n^2)$ edges, are\nanswered by recent results of Borgs, Chayes, Lov\\'asz, S\\'os, Szegedy and\nVesztergombi, who showed that several natural metrics on graphs are equivalent,\nand moreover that any sequence of graphs converges in each metric to a graphon,\ni.e., a kernel taking values in $[0,1]$.\n  Possible generalizations of these results to graphs with $o(n^2)$ but\n$\\omega(n)$ edges are discussed in a companion paper [arXiv:0708.1919]; here we\nfocus only on graphs with $\\Theta(n)$ edges, which turn out to be much harder\nto handle. Many new phenomena occur, and there are a host of plausible metrics\nto consider; many of these metrics suggest new random graph models, and vice\nversa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2008 15:34:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2009 18:24:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 10:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-10"}
