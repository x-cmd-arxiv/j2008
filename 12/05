However, this must be done with the least amount of protection\nresources, while using simple management plane functionality. Recently, network\ncoding has been proposed as a solution to provide agile and cost efficient\nnetwork self-healing against link failures, in a manner that does not require\ndata rerouting, packet retransmission, or failure localization, hence leading\nto simple control and management planes. To achieve this, separate paths have\nto be provisioned to carry encoded packets, hence requiring either the addition\nof extra links, or reserving some of the resources for this purpose.\n  In this paper we introduce autonomic self-healing strategies for autonomic\nnetworks in order to protect against link failures. The strategies are based on\nnetwork coding and reduced capacity, which is a technique that we call network\nprotection codes (NPC). In these strategies, an autonomic network is able to\nprovide self-healing from various network failures affecting network operation.\nThe techniques improve service and enhance reliability of autonomic\ncommunication.\n  Network protection codes are extended to provide self-healing from multiple\nlink failures in autonomic networks. We provide implementation aspects of the\nproposed strategies. We present bounds and network protection code\nconstructions. Finally, we study the construction of such codes over the binary\nfield.

Our simulations\nfollow eight haloes similar in mass to the Milky Way and extracted from a large\ncosmological simulation without restriction on spin parameter or merger\nhistory. This allows us to investigate how the final properties of the\nsimulated galaxies correlate with the formation histories of their haloes. We\nfind that, at z = 0, none of our galaxies contain a disc with more than 20 per\ncent of its total stellar mass. Four of the eight galaxies nevertheless have\nwell-formed disc components, three have dominant spheroids and very small\ndiscs, and one is a spheroidal galaxy with no disc at all. The z = 0 spheroids\nare made of old stars, while discs are younger and formed from the inside-out.\nNeither the existence of a disc at z = 0 nor the final disc-to-total mass ratio\nseems to depend on the spin parameter of the halo. Discs are formed in haloes\nwith spin parameters as low as 0.01 and as high as 0.05; galaxies with little\nor no disc component span the same range in spin parameter. Except for one of\nthe simulated galaxies, all have significant discs at z > ~2, regardless of\ntheir z = 0 morphologies. Major mergers and instabilities which arise when\naccreting cold gas is misaligned with the stellar disc trigger a transfer of\nmass from the discs to the spheroids. In some cases, discs are destroyed, while\nin others, they survive or reform. This suggests that the survival probability\nof discs depends on the particular formation history of each galaxy. A\nrealistic Lambda-CDM model will clearly require weaker star formation at high\nredshift and later disc assembly than occurs in our models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 20:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 13:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

They thereby\nchallenge the conventional LGRB-SN connection and naturally give rise to the\nquestion: are there other peculiar features in their afterglows which would\nhelp shed light on their progenitors? To answer this question, we combine new\nobservational data with published data and investigate the multi-band temporal\nand spectral properties of the two afterglows. We find that both afterglows can\nbe well interpreted within the framework of the jetted standard external shock\nwave model, and that the afterglow parameters for both bursts fall well within\nthe range observed for other LGRBs. Hence, from the properties of the\nafterglows there is nothing to suggest that these bursts should have another\nprogenitor than other LGRBs. Recently, Swift-discovered GRB080503 also has the\nspike + tail structure during its prompt gamma-ray emission seemingly similar\nto GRB060614. We analyse the prompt emission of this burst and find that this\nGRB is actually a hard-spike + hard-tail burst with a spectral lag of\n0.8$\\pm$0.4 s during its tail emission. Thus, the properties of the prompt\nemission of GRB060614 and GRB080503 are clearly different, motivating further\nthinking of GRB classification. Finally we note that, whereas the progenitor of\nthe two SN-less bursts remains uncertain, the core-collapse origin for the\nSN-less bursts would be quite certain if a wind-like environment can be\nobservationally established, e.g, from an optical decay faster than the X-ray\ndecay in the afterglow's slow cooling phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 19:37:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2009 19:43:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

This problem involves\nenumerating candidate pathways and studying their energetics to garner insight\ninto instabilities and energy barriers. The purpose of this work is to\ninvestigate the energetics of two transformation pathways for the delta to\nalpha' transformation in Pu that were recently proposed [Lookman et al., Phys.\nRev. Lett. 100:145504, 2008] on the basis of symmetry. These pathways require\nthe presence of either an intermediate hexagonal closed-packed (hcp) structure\nor a simple hexagonal (sh) structure. A subgroup of the parent fcc and the\nintermediate hexagonal structure, which has trigonal symmetry, facilitates the\ntransformation to the intermediate hcp or sh structure. Phonons then break the\ntranslational symmetry from the intermediate hcp or sh structure to the final\nmonoclinic symmetry of the alpha' structure. We perform simulations using the\nmodified embedded atom method (MEAM) for Pu to investigate these candidate\npathways. Our main conclusion is that the path via hcp is energetically favored\nand the volume change for both pathways essentially occurs in the second step\nof the transformation, i.e. from the intermediate sh or hcp to the monoclinic\nstructure. Our work also highlights the deficiency of the current\nstate-of-the-art MEAM potential in capturing the anisotropy associated with the\nlower symmetry monoclinic structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 17:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

An analysis of the rest-frame\nultraviolet, optical, near- and mid-infrared colors reveals that these six\nsystems exhibit signs of nuclear activity (AGN)and/or extreme star formation.\nNotably, they have properties that bridge galaxies dominated by star formation\n(Lyman-break galaxies; LBGs) and those with AGNs (LBGs classified as QSOs). The\nLAB systems not detected in all four IRAC bands, on the other hand, are, as a\ngroup, consistent with pure star forming systems, similar to the majority of\nthe LBGs within the filament. These results indicate that the galaxies within\nLABs do not comprise a homogeneous population, though they are also consistent\nwith scenarios in which the gas halos are ionized through a common mechanism\nsuch as galaxy-scale winds driven by the galaxies within them, or gravitational\nheating of the collapsing cloud itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 17:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The reason is that detectors after the drifting selection will\nintegrate instantaneous electric or magnetic field values from successive\nsinusoids, and these sinusoids would differ in both frequency and phase. Phase\ndifferences between frequencies are ordinarily irrelevant, and recalibration\nprocedures at most correct for frequency differences. With drifting selection,\nhowever, each integrated field value comes from *the sinusoid of the\ninstantaneously selected frequency at its instantaneous received phase*, hence\nthe waveform constructed by the integration will follow the drifting selection\nwith a phase acceleration given by the drift rate times the slope of the\nreceived phase spectrum. A phase acceleration is literally a frequency shift,\nand the phase spectrum slope of a received waveform is an asymptotic measure of\nthe source distance, as the path delay presents phase offsets proportional to\nfrequency times the distance, and eventually exceeding all initial phase\ndifferences.

In a resource constrained\nsituation, deciding which parameters to observe in order to optimize system\nperformance itself becomes an interesting and important optimization problem.\nThis general problem is the focus of this paper.\n  One of the most important considerations in this framework is whether\nadaptivity is required for the observations. Adaptive observations introduce\nblocking or sequential operations in the system whereas non-adaptive\nobservations can be performed in parallel. One of the important questions in\nthis regard is to characterize the benefit of adaptivity for probes and\nobservation.\n  We present general techniques for designing constant factor approximations to\nthe optimal observation schemes for several widely used scheduling and metric\nobjective functions.

Using special relativity, the time coordinate in the frame\nof reference of a moving particle is expressed in terms of the coordinates in\nthe laboratory frame of reference in order to provide an initial spatiotemporal\nfunction to work from in initiating the development of a quantum wave. When\ntemporal periodicity is ascribed to the particle, a provisional spatiotemporal\nfunction for a particle travelling at constant velocity manifests itself as an\nrunning wave characterized by parameters associated with the moving particle. A\nwave description for bidirectional motion is generated based on an average time\ncoordinate for a combination of oppositely directed elementary running waves,\nand the resulting spatiotemporal function exhibits wave behavior characteristic\nof a standing wave.

We revisit a mechanism\nproposed by Ogilvie and Lin for tidal forcing of inertial waves, which are\nshort-wavelength, low-frequency disturbances restored primarily by Coriolis\nrather than buoyancy forces. This mechanism is of particular interest for hot\nJupiters because it relies upon a rocky core, and because these bodies are\notherwise largely convective. Compared to waves excited at the base of the\nstratified, externally heated atmosphere, waves excited at the core are more\nlikely to deposit heat in the convective region and thereby affect the\nplanetary radius. However, Ogilvie and Lin's results were numerical, and the\nmanner of the wave excitation was not clear. Using WKB methods, we demonstrate\nthe production of short waves by scattering of the equilibrium tide off the\ncore at critical latitudes. The tidal dissipation rate associated with these\nwaves scales as the fifth power of the core radius, and the implied tidal $Q$\nis of order ten million for nominal values of the planet's mass, radius,\norbital period, and core size. We comment upon an alternative proposal by Wu\nfor exciting inertial waves in an unstratified fluid body by means of\ncompressibility rather than a core. We also find that even a core of rock is\nunlikely to be rigid.

In full text problems, the expansion of word features with\nword-proximity networks is shown to be useful, though the need for some\nimprovements is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 21:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-08"}

Many\nlenses with Re around 1-2\" and above 10\" have been reported but very few in\nbetween. In this article, we present a sample of 13 strong lensing systems with\nRe in the range 3\"- 8\", i.e. systems produced by galaxy group scale dark matter\nhaloes, spanning a redshift range from 0.3 to 0.8. This opens a new window of\nexploration in the mass spectrum, around 10^{13}- 10^{14} M_{sun}, which is a\ncrucial range for understanding the transition between galaxies and galaxy\nclusters. Our analysis is based on multi-colour CFHTLS images complemented with\nHST imaging and ground based spectroscopy. Large scale properties are derived\nfrom both the light distribution of the elliptical galaxies group members and\nweak lensing of the faint background galaxy population. On small scales, the\nstrong lensing analysis yields Einstein radii between 2.5\" and 8\". On larger\nscales, the strong lenses coincide with the peak of the light distribution,\nsuggesting that mass is traced by light. Most of the luminosity maps have\ncomplicated shapes, indicating that these intermediate mass structures are\ndynamically young. Fitting the reduced shear with a Singular Isothermal Sphere,\nwe find sigma ~ 500 km/s and an upper limit of ~900 km/s for the whole sample.\nThe mass to light ratio for the sample is found to be M/L_i ~ 250 (solar units,\ncorrected for evolution), with an upper limit of 500. This can be compared to\nmass to light ratios of small groups (with sigma ~ 300 km/s and galaxy clusters\nwith sigma > 1000 km/s, thus bridging the gap between these mass scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 21:53:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 13:20:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 08:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

An afterglow flux evolving as a\npower-law in time, a bright optical flash during/after the burst, and a\nlight-curve break due to a tight ejecta collimation are the major predictions\nthat were confirmed observationally, but it should be recognized that\nlight-curve decay indices are not correlated with the spectral slopes (as would\nbe expected), optical flashes are quite rare, and jet-breaks harder to find in\nSwift X-ray afterglows.\n  The slowing of the early optical flux decay rate is accompanied by a spectral\nevolution, indicating that the emission from ejecta (energized by the reverse\nshock) is dominant in the optical over that from the forward shock (which\nenergizes the ambient medium) only up to 1 ks. However, a long-lived reverse\nshock is required to account for the slow radio flux decays observed in many\nafterglows after ~10 day.\n  X-ray light-curve plateaus could be due to variations in the average\nenergy-per-solid-angle of the blast-wave, confirming to two other anticipated\nfeatures of GRB outflows: energy injection and angular structure. The latter is\nalso the more likely origin of the fast-rises seen in some optical\nlight-curves. To account for the existence of both chromatic and achromatic\nafterglow light-curve breaks, the overall picture must be even more complex and\ninclude a new mechanism that dominates occasionally the emission from the\nblast-wave: either late internal shocks or scattering (bulk and/or\ninverse-Compton) of the blast-wave emission by an outflow interior to it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 22:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25"}

Of significant concern, however, has been that a strong\ntoroidal field in the jet should be highly unstable to the non-axisymmetric\nhelical kink (screw) $m=1$ mode leading to rapid disruption. In addition, a\nrecent concern has been that the jet formation process itself may be unstable\ndue to the accretion of non-dipolar magnetic fields. We describe large-scale\nfully three-dimensional global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations of rapidly rotating, accreting black holes producing jets. We study\nboth the stability of the jet as it propagates and the stability of the jet\nformation process during accretion of dipolar and quadrupolar fields. For our\ndipolar model, despite strong non-axisymmetric disc turbulence, the jet reaches\nLorentz factors of $\\Gamma\\sim 10$ with opening half-angle $\\theta_j\\sim\n5^\\circ$ at $10^3$ gravitational radii without significant disruption or\ndissipation with only mild substructure dominated by the $m=1$ mode. On the\ncontrary, our quadrupolar model does not produce a steady relativistic\n($\\Gamma\\gtrsim 3$) jet due to mass-loading of the polar regions caused by\nunstable polar fields. Thus, if produced, relativistic jets are roughly stable\nstructures and may reach up to an external shock with strong magnetic fields.\nWe discuss the astrophysical implications of the accreted magnetic geometry\nplaying such a significant role in relativistic jet formation, and we outline\navenues for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2008 00:53:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2009 18:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this paper,\nwe study the decidability of the equivalence of multi-letter QFAs, and the main\ntechnical contributions are as follows: (1) We show that any two automata, a\n$k_{1}$-letter QFA ${\\cal A}_1$ and a $k_{2}$-letter QFA ${\\cal A}_2$, over the\nsame input alphabet $\\Sigma$ are equivalent if and only if they are\n$(n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+k)$-equivalent, where $m=|\\Sigma|$ is the cardinality of\n$\\Sigma$, $k=\\max(k_{1},k_{2})$, and $n=n_{1}+n_{2}$, with $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$\nbeing the numbers of states of ${\\cal A}_{1}$ and ${\\cal A}_{2}$, respectively.\nWhen $k=1$, we obtain the decidability of equivalence of measure-once QFAs in\nthe literature.

Therefore, we design a polynomial-time\n$O(m^{2k-1}n^{8}+km^kn^{6})$ algorithm for determining the equivalence of any\ntwo multi-letter QFAs.

The product of Volterra analysis, the\nVolterra kernels, are particularly suited to quantifying intra- and inter-input\ninteractions. They are also readily interpretable, which means that they can be\nrelated directly to physical behaviors, and more distantly, to the underlying\nprocessing mechanisms of the system being tested. However, accurate estimation\nof a sufficient set of classical kernels is often not possible for complex\nsystems because the number of kernels that need to be determined, and hence\nexperiment time, increases radically with system memory, response frequency\nbandwidth, and non-linear interaction order. Practical approaches to kernel\nestimation often involve forced reductions of the generality of the analysis\nthat in turn compromise interpretability.\n  Here we illustrate the effects on kernel interpretability of two common\nreductions, slow-stimulation and the use of binary inputs, using both numerical\nsimulations and data from a Visual Evoked Potential experiment. We show how a\nnon-standard version of binary analysis, involving a different coding of the\ninputs and the use of particular groupings of kernel slices, improves kernel\ninterpretability.

This DDFT is capable of describing the\ndynamics of the fluid density profile down to the scale of the individual\nparticles. As with previous DDFTs, the dynamical equations require as input the\nHelmholtz free energy functional from equilibrium density functional theory\n(DFT). For an equilibrium system, the theory predicts the same fluid one-body\ndensity profile as one would obtain from DFT.

This property gives rise to\nnumerous applications, both in applied sciences and in theoretical physics.\nElectronic circuits made out of graphene could take advantage of its high\nelectron mobility that is witnessed even at room temperature. In the\ntheoretical domain the Dirac-like behavior of graphene can simulate high energy\neffects, such as the relativistic Klein paradox.

A bump in the\nsusceptibility well below Tc as well as a slight broadening of the Fe Mossbauer\nline below 15 K evidence an interplay between the Eu magnetism and the\nsuperconducting state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2008 13:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-26"}

The main purpose of this paper is to study time delays between the\nlight variations in different wavebands for a sample of quasars. Measuring a\nreliable time delay for a large number of quasars may help constraint the\nmodels of their central engines. The standard accretion disk irradiation model\npredicts a delay of the longer wavelengths behind the shorter ones, a delay\nthat depends on the fundamental quasar parameters. Since the black hole masses\nand the accretion rates are approximately known for the sample we use, one can\ncompare the observed time delays with the expected ones.\n  Methods. We applied the interpolation cross-correlation function (ICCF)\nmethod to the Giveon et al. sample of 42 quasars, monitored in two (B and R)\ncolors, to find the time lags represented by the ICCF peaks. Different tests\nwere performed to assess the influence of photometric errors, sampling, etc.,\non the final result.\n  Results. We found that most of the objects show a delay in the red light\ncurve behind the blue one (a positive lag), which on average for the sample is\nabout +4 days (+3 for the median), although the scatter is significant. These\nresults are broadly consistent with the reprocessing model, especially for the\nwell-sampled objects. The normalized time-lag deviations do not seem to\ncorrelate significantly with other quasar properties, including optical, radio,\nor X-ray measurables. On the other hand, many objects show a clear negative\nlag, which, if real, may have important consequences for the variability\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2008 13:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Eight are eclipsing binaries with orbital solutions\nwhose periods are consistent with their photometric ephemerides; two of these\nspectroscopic orbits are singled-lined and six are double-lined. For one of the\ncandidates, a nearby but fainter eclipsing binary proved to be the source for\nthe HATNet light curve, due to blending in the HATNet images. Four of the\ncandidates were found to be rotating more rapidly than vsini = 50 km/s and were\nnot pursued further. Thirteen of the candidates showed no significant velocity\nvariation at the level of 0.5 to 1.0 km/s . Seven of these were eventually\nwithdrawn as photometric false alarms based on an independent reanalysis using\nmore sophisticated tools.

For this reason it is\ncurrently widely used, in particular for large scale simulations of neural\nnetworks. This model emulates the dynamics of the membrane potential of a\nneuron together with an adaptation variable. The subthreshold dynamics is\ngoverned by a two-parameter differential equation, and a spike is emitted when\nthe membrane potential variable reaches a given cutoff value. Subsequently the\nmembrane potential is reset, and the adaptation variable is added a fixed value\ncalled the spike-triggered adaptation parameter. We show in this note that when\nthe system does not converge to an equilibrium point, both variables of the\nsubthreshold dynamical system blow up in finite time whatever the parameters of\nthe dynamics. The cutoff is therefore essential for the model to be well\ndefined and simulated. The divergence of the adaptation variable makes the\nsystem very sensitive to the cutoff: changing this parameter dramatically\nchanges the spike patterns produced. Furthermore from a computational\nviewpoint, the fact that the adaptation variable blows up and the very sharp\nslope it has when the spike is emitted implies that the time step of the\nnumerical simulation needs to be very small (or adaptive) in order to catch an\naccurate value of the adaptation at the time of the spike. It is not the case\nfor the similar quartic (Touboul 2008) and exponential (Brette and Gerstner\n2005) models whose adaptation variable does not blow up in finite time, and\nwhich are therefore very robust to changes in the cutoff value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2008 15:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-07"}

In this article, we discuss theoretical expectations for the\nin-medium hadron spectra associated with partial restoration of chiral symmetry\nand the current status of experiments with an emphasis on the measurements of\nproperties of mesons produced in near-ground-state nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 22:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 18:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-02"}
