Our focus is on\nthe non-linear dynamics of the shock wave that forms in the collapse, and the\nassembly of positive energy material below it. To this end, we perform\ntime-dependent hydrodynamic simulations with FLASH2.5 in spherical and axial\nsymmetry. These generalize our previous calculations by allowing for bulk\nneutrino heating and for nuclear statistical equilibrium between n, p and\nalpha. The heating rate is freely tunable, as is the starting radius of the\nshock relative to the recombination radius of alpha-particles. An explosion in\nspherical symmetry involves the excitation of an overstable mode, which may be\nviewed as the L=0 version of the `Standing Accretion Shock Instability'. In 2D\nsimulations, non-spherical deformations of the shock are driven by plumes of\nmaterial with positive Bernoulli parameter, which are concentrated well outside\nthe zone of strong neutrino heating. The non-spherical modes of the shock reach\na large amplitude only when the heating rate is also high enough to excite\nconvection below the shock. The critical heating rate that causes an explosion\ndepends sensitively on the initial position of the shock relative to the\nrecombination radius. Weaker heating is required to drive an explosion in 2D\nthan in 1D, but the difference also depends on the size of the shock. Forcing\nthe infalling heavy nuclei to break up into n and p below the shock only causes\na slight increase in the critical heating rate, except when the shock starts\nout at a large radius. This shows that heating by neutrinos (or some other\nmechanism) must play a significant role in pushing the shock far enough out\nthat recombination heating takes over.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2008 20:13:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2009 17:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

For example,\nit would provide new information about gas and magnetic field interactions in\ndynamical spacetimes as well as a combination of redshift and luminosity\ndistance that would enable precise cosmological tests. A proposal first made by\nBode & Phinney (2007) is that because radiation of gravitational waves during\nthe final inspiral and merger of the holes is abrupt and decreases the mass of\nthe central object by a few percent, there will be waves in the disk that can\nsteepen into shocks and thus increase the disk luminosity in a characteristic\nway. We evaluate this process analytically and numerically. We find that shocks\nonly occur when the fractional mass loss exceeds the half-thickness (h/r) of\nthe disk, hence significant energy release only occurs for geometrically thin\ndisks which are thus at low Eddington ratios. This strongly limits the\neffective energy release, and in fact our simulations show that the natural\nvariations in disk luminosity are likely to obscure this effect entirely.\nHowever, we demonstrate that the reduction of luminosity caused by the retreat\nof the inner edge of the disk following mass loss is potentially detectable.\nThis decrease occurs even if the disk is geometrically thick, and lasts for a\nduration on the order of the viscous time of the modified disk.\nObservationally, the best prospect for detection would be a sensitive future\nX-ray instrument with a field of view of on the order of a square degree, or\npossibly a wide-field radio array such as the Square Kilometer Array, if the\ndisk changes produce or interrupt radio emission from a jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2008 18:32:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 20:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

Our construction does not use any special\nfeatures of equivariant K-theory. To highlight this, we construct bivariant\nextensions for arbitrary equivariant multiplicative cohomology theories.\n  We formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for certain duality\nisomorphisms in the geometric bivariant K-theory and verify these conditions in\nsome cases, including smooth manifolds with a smooth cocompact action of a Lie\ngroup. One of these duality isomorphisms reduces bivariant K-theory to K-theory\nwith support conditions. Since similar duality isomorphisms exist in Kasparov\ntheory, both bivariant K-theories agree if there is such a duality isomorphism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2008 19:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2009 07:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-29"}

His point became moot, however, with the\nsuccess of the ionic picture of Van Vleck, where ligands influence magnetic\nelectrons of 3d ions mainly through electrostatic fields. Anderson's theory of\nspin superexchange later established that covalency is at the heart of\ncooperative magnetism in insulators, but its energy scale was believed to be\nsmall compared to other inter-ionic interactions and therefore it was\nconsidered a small perturbation of the ionic picture. This assertion fails\ndramatically in copper oxides, which came to prominence following the discovery\nof high critical temperature superconductors (HTSC). Magnetic interactions in\ncuprates are remarkably strong and are often considered the origin of the\nunusually high superconducting transition temperature, Tc. Here we report a\ndetailed survey of magnetic excitations in the one-dimensional cuprate Sr2CuO3\nusing inelastic neutron scattering (INS). We show that although the\nexperimental dynamical spin structure factor is well described by the model\nS=1/2 nearest-neighbour Heisenberg Hamiltonian typically used for cuprates, the\nmagnetic intensity is modified dramatically by strong hybridization of Cu 3d\nstates with O p states, showing that the ionic picture of localized 3d\nHeisenberg spin magnetism is grossly inadequate. Our findings provide a natural\nexplanation for the puzzle of the missing INS magnetic intensity in cuprates\nand have profound implications for understanding current and future\nexperimental data on these materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2008 16:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-28"}

The X-ray color evolution first\nresembles the Cyg X-2 subgroup of Z sources, with frequent excursions on the\nhorizontal and normal branches (HB/NB). The source then decays and evolves to\nthe Sco X-1 subgroup, with increasing focus on the flaring branch (FB) and the\nlower vertex of the \"Z\". Finally, the FB subsides, and the source transforms\ninto an atoll source, with the lower vertex evolving to the atoll soft state.\nSpectral analyses suggest that the atoll stage is characterized by a constant\ninner disk radius, while the Z stages exhibit a luminosity-dependent expansion\nof the inner disk, which we interpret as effects related to the local Eddington\nlimit. Contrary to the view that the mass accretion rate ($\\dot{m}$) changes\nalong the Z, we find that changes in $\\dot{m}$ are instead responsible for the\nsecular evolution of the Z and the subclasses. Motion along the Z branches\nappears to be caused by three different mechanisms that may operate at roughly\nconstant $\\dot{m}$. For the Sco X-1-like Z stage, we find that the FB is an\ninstability track that proceeds off the lower vertex when the inner disk radius\nshrinks from the value set by the X-ray luminosity toward the value measured\nfor the atoll soft state. Excursions up the NB occur when the apparent size of\nthe boundary layer increases while the disk exhibits little change. The HB is\nassociated with Comptonization of the disk emission. The Z branches for the Cyg\nX-2-like stage are more complicated, and their origin is unclear. Finally, our\nspectral results lead us to hypothesize that the lower and upper Z vertices\ncorrespond to a standard thin disk and a slim disk, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2008 00:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Soon after appearance on the solar surface the magnetic flux gets\nconcentrated in sunspot regions and causes numerous active phenomena on the\nSun. This paper discusses some properties of the emerging magnetic flux\nobserved on the solar surface and in the interior. A statistical analysis of\nvariations of the tilt angle of bipolar magnetic regions during the emergence\nshows that the systematic tilt with respect to the equator (the Joy's law) is\nmost likely established below the surface. However, no evidence of the\ndependence of the tilt angle on the amount of emerging magnetic flux, predicted\nby the rising magnetic flux rope theories, is found. Analysis of surface plasma\nflows in a large emerging active region reveals strong localized upflows and\ndownflows at the initial phase of emergence but finds no evidence for\nlarge-scale flows indicating future appearance a large-scale magnetic\nstructure. Local helioseismology provides important tools for mapping\nperturbations of the wave speed and mass flows below the surface. Initial\nresults from SOHO/MDI and GONG reveal strong diverging flows during the flux\nemergence, and also localized converging flows around stable sunspots. The wave\nspeed images obtained during the process of formation of a large active region,\nNOAA 10488, indicate that the magnetic flux gets concentrated in strong field\nstructures just below the surface. Further studies of magnetic flux emergence\nrequire systematic helioseismic observations from the ground and space, and\nrealistic MHD simulations of the subsurface dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2008 01:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

As our system model we use Petri\nnets. In Petri nets, an inherent concept of simultaneity is built in, since\nwhen a transition has more than one preplace, it can be crucial that tokens are\nremoved instantaneously. When modelling a system which is intended to be\nimplemented in a distributed way by a Petri net, this built-in concept of\nsynchronous interaction may be problematic. To investigate this we consider\nasynchronous implementations of nets, in which removing tokens from places can\nno longer be considered as instantaneous. We model this by inserting silent\n(unobservable) transitions between transitions and some of their preplaces. We\ninvestigate three such implementations, differing in the selection of preplaces\nof a transition from which the removal of a token is considered time consuming,\nand the possibility of collecting the tokens in a given order.\n  We investigate the effect of these different transformations of instantaneous\ninteraction into asynchronous interaction patterns by comparing the behaviours\nof nets before and after insertion of the silent transitions. We exhibit for\nwhich classes of Petri nets we obtain equivalent behaviour with respect to\nfailures equivalence.\n  It turns out that the resulting hierarchy of Petri net classes can be\ndescribed by semi-structural properties.

In this paper, we investigate the paradigms of\nsynchronous and asynchronous interaction in the context of distributed systems.\nWe investigate to what extent or under which conditions synchronous interaction\nis a valid concept for specification and implementation of such systems. We\nchoose Petri nets as our system model and consider different notions of\ndistribution by associating locations to elements of nets. First, we\ninvestigate the concept of simultaneity which is inherent in the semantics of\nPetri nets when transitions have multiple input places. We assume that tokens\nmay only be taken instantaneously by transitions on the same location. We\nexhibit a hierarchy of `asynchronous' Petri net classes by different\nassumptions on possible distributions. Alternatively, we assume that the\nsynchronisations specified in a Petri net are crucial system properties. Hence\ntransitions and their preplaces may no longer placed on separate locations. We\nthen answer the question which systems may be implemented in a distributed way\nwithout restricting concurrency, assuming that locations are inherently\nsequential. It turns out that in both settings we find semi-structural\nproperties of Petri nets describing exactly the problematic situations for\ninteractions in distributed systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2008 04:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-05"}
