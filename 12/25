However there are still phenomena in nature\nwhich cannot be explained, and as such new theories will be required. Since\nterrestrial experiments are limited in both the energy and precision that can\nbe probed, new methods are required to search for signs of physics beyond the\nStandard Model. In this dissertation, I demonstrate how these theories can be\nprobed by searching for remnants of their effects in the early Universe. In\nparticular I focus on three possible extensions of the Standard Model: the\naddition of massive neutral particles as dark matter (through the use of\nseveral minimal models of dark matter), the addition of charged massive\nparticles (through catalyzed Big Bang Nucleosynthesis), and the existence of\nhigher dimensions (through its effects on BBN and galactic positron\nproduction). For each new model, I review the existing experimental bounds and\nthe potential for discovering new physics in the next generation of\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2008 18:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-25"}

In this paper, we\nstudy the alignment by radiative torques for large irregular grains, e.g.,\ngrains in accretion disks, for which internal relaxation is subdominant. We use\nboth numerical calculations and the analytical model of a helical grain\nintroduced by us earlier. We demonstrate that grains in such a regime exhibit\nmore complex dynamics. In particular, if initially the grain axis of maximum\nmoment of inertia makes a small angle with angular momentum, then radiative\ntorques can align the grain axis of maximum moment of inertia with angular\nmomentum, and both axis of maximum moment of inertia and angular momentum are\naligned with the magnetic field when attractors with high angular momentum\n(high-J attractors) are available. For the alignment without high-J attractors,\nbeside the earlier studied attractors with low angular momentum (low-J\nattractors), there appears new low-J attractors. The former and later cases\ncorrespond to the alignment with long axes perpendicular and parallel to the\nangular momentum, respectively. In addition, we study the alignment of grains\nin the presence of strong internal relaxation, but induced not by a radiation\nbeam as in earlier studies, instead, induced by a complex radiation field, that\ncan be decomposed into dipole and quadrupole components. We find that in this\nsituation, the parameter space $q^{max}$, for the existence of high-$J$\nattractors is more extended, which entails higher degrees of polarization\nexpected.

Therefore realistic studies\nof astrophysical magnetic reconnection should include the effects of stochastic\nmagnetic field. In the paper we discuss and test numerically the Lazarian &\nVishniac (1999) model of magnetic field reconnection of weakly stochastic\nfields. The turbulence in the model is assumed to be subAlfvenic, with the\nmagnetic field only slightly perturbed. The model predicts that the degree of\nmagnetic field stochasticity controls the reconnection rate and that the\nreconnection can be fast independently on the presence or absence of anomalous\nplasma effects. For testing of the model we use 3D MHD simulations. To measure\nthe reconnection rate we employ both the inflow of magnetic flux and a more\nsophisticated measure that we introduce in the paper. Both measures of\nreconnection provide consistent results. Our testing successfully reproduces\nthe dependences predicted by the model, including the variations of the\nreconnection speed with the variations of the injection scale of turbulence\ndriving as well as the intensity of driving. We conclude that, while anomalous\nand Hall-MHD effects in particular circumstances may be important for the\ninitiation of reconnection, the generic astrophysical reconnection is fast due\nto turbulence, irrespectively of the microphysical plasma effects involved.\nThis conclusion justifies numerical modeling of many astrophysical\nenvironments, e.g. interstellar medium, for which plasma-effect-based\ncollisionless reconnection is not applicable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2008 22:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-31"}

In\nthe HRM a quark of one nucleon knocked out by an incoming photon rescatters\nwith a quark of the other nucleon leading to the production of two nucleons\nwith large relative momentum. Assuming the dominance of the quark-interchange\nmechanism in a hard NN scattering, the HRM allows to express the amplitude of a\ntwo-nucleon break-up reaction through the convolution of photon-quark\nscattering, $NN$ hard scattering amplitude and nuclear spectral function. The\nphoton-quark scattering amplitude can be explicitly calculated in the high\nenergy regime, whereas for $NN$ scattering one uses the fit of the available\nexperimental data. The HRM predicts several specific features for the hard\nbreakup reaction. First, the cross section will approximately scale as\n$s^{-11}$. Secondly, the $s^{11}$ weighted cross section will have the shape of\nenergy dependence similar to that of $s^{10}$ weighted $NN$ elastic scattering\ncross section. Also one predicts an enhancement of the $pp$ breakup relative to\nthe $pn$ breakup cross section as compared to the results from low energy\nkinematics. Another result is the prediction of different spectator momentum\ndependencies of $pp$ and $pn$ breakup cross sections. This is due to the fact\nthat same-helicity $pp$-component is strongly suppressed in the ground state\nwave function of $^3$He. Because of this suppression the HRM predicts\nsignificantly different asymmetries for the cross section of polarization\ntransfer $NN$ breakup reactions for circularly polarized photons.

As the cause of\nthis enigmatic behavior non-radial pulsations and/or a surface magnetic field\nare suggested. We present a preliminary report on our attempts to detect a\nmagnetic field in this star with high-resolution measurements obtained with the\nspectropolarimeter Narval at TBL, France during 2 observing runs of 5 nights in\n2006 and 5 nights in 2007. Only upper limits could be obtained, even with the\nlongest possible exposure times. If the star hosts a magnetic field, its\nsurface strength should be less than about 300 G.
