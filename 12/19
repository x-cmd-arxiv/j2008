For our fiducial reionization\nmodel, in which reionization begins at z~15 and ends by z~6, we find a strong\nbias for cluster-size halos to be in the regions which reionized first, at\nredshifts 10<z<15. Consequently, material in clusters was reionized within\nrelatively small regions, on the order of a few Mpc, implying that all clusters\nin our calculation were reionized by their own progenitors. Milky Way mass\nhalos were on average reionized later and by larger regions, with a\ndistribution similar to the global one, indicating that low mass halos are\nrelatively uncorrelated with reionization when only their mass is taken as a\nprior. On average, we find that most halos with mass less than 10^13 Msun were\nreionized internally, while almost all halos with masses greater than 10^14\nMsun were reionized by their own progenitors.

In addition to spectroscopic\nsurveys, radial BAO might be measured from accurate enough photometric\nredshifts obtained with narrow-band filters. We explore the requirements for a\nphotometric survey using Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) to competitively measure\nthe radial BAO signal and discuss the possible systematic errors of this\napproach. If LRG were a highly homogeneous population, we show that the photo-z\naccuracy would not substantially improve by increasing the number of filters\nbeyond $\\sim 10$, except for a small fraction of the sources detected at high\nsignal-to-noise, and broad-band filters would suffice to achieve the target\n$\\sigma_z = 0.003 (1+z)$ for measuring radial BAO.

We resolve this puzzle by showing that for\nthe microscopic black holes, on top the usual quantum evaporation time, there\nis a new time-scale which characterizes a purely classical process during which\nthe black hole looses the ability to differentiate among the species, and\nbecomes democratic. We demonstrate this phenomenon in a well-understood\nframework of large extra dimensions, with a number of parallel branes. An\ninitially non-democratic black hole is the one localized on one of the branes,\nwith its high-dimensional Schwarzschild radius being much shorter than the\ninterbrane distance. Such a black hole seemingly cannot evaporate into the\nspecies localized on the other branes, that are beyond its reach. We\ndemonstrate that in reality the system evolves classically in time, in such a\nway that the black hole accretes the neighboring branes. The end result is a\ncompletely democratic static configuration, in which all the branes share the\nsame black hole, and all the species are produced with the same Hawking\ntemperature.

One of them is based on the\nprinciple of projective invariance which is a purely N = 2 concept having no\nanalogue in simple supergravity. In this approach, the component reduction of\nthe action is performed without imposing any Wess-Zumino gauge condition, that\nis by keeping intact all the gauge symmetries of the superfield action,\nincluding the super-Weyl invariance. As a simple application, the c-map is\nderived for the first time from superfield supergravity. Our second approach to\ncomponent reduction is based on the method of normal coordinates around a\nsubmanifold in a curved superspace, which we develop in detail. We derive\ndifferential equations which are obeyed by the vielbein and the connection in\nnormal coordinates, and which can be used to reconstruct these objects, in\nprinciple in closed form. A separate equation is found for the\nsuper-determinant of the vielbein, which allows one to reconstruct it without a\ndetailed knowledge of the vielbein. This approach is applicable to any\nsupergravity theory in any number of space-time dimensions. As a simple\napplication of this construction, we reduce an integral over the curved N = 2\nsuperspace to that over the chiral subspace of the full superspace.

As illustrative examples, the algorithm is\napplied to the Gross-Neveu model and to the Schwinger model in the strong\ncoupling limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 20:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

We explore how photometric\nredshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing the\nsurvey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshift\nestimates. For a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging area\nof 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both in\ncompleteness depth and precision, than systems with n_f >= 8 filters. Our\nresults suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm the\nimprovements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effective\nphotometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width than\nnaively expected from the reduction in S/N. Adding near-IR observations\nimproves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system which\nmaximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters with\nlogarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-band\noverlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5\nfilter systems.

This physical process explains active region\nshear flows and why the magnetic field is found to be nearly parallel to\nphotospheric polarity inversion lines where prominences form.

Our observations do not show significant radio emission from the\nmini-halo, hence we present upper limits to the integrated, diffuse non-thermal\nradio emission of the core of the Ophiuchus cluster.

At the same time, the trapping of vortices in\nsuperconducting microwave resonant circuits contributes excess loss and can\nresult in substantial reductions in the quality factor. Thus, understanding the\nmicrowave vortex response in superconducting thin films is important for the\ndesign of such circuits, including superconducting qubits and photon detectors,\nwhich are typically operated in small, but non-zero, magnetic fields. By\ncooling in fields of the order of 100 $\\mu$T and below, we have characterized\nthe magnetic field and frequency dependence of the microwave response of a\nsmall density of vortices in resonators fabricated from thin films of Re and\nAl, which are common materials used in superconducting microwave circuits.\nAbove a certain threshold cooling field, which is different for the Re and Al\nfilms, vortices become trapped in the resonators. Vortices in the Al resonators\ncontribute greater loss and are influenced more strongly by flux creep effects\nthan in the Re resonators. This different behavior can be described in the\nframework of a general vortex dynamics model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 20:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 22:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 May 2009 18:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-18"}

It has generally been assumed that AIC does not\nproduce a detectable supernova (SN). If, however, the progenitor WD is rapidly\nrotating (as may be expected due to its prior accretion), a centrifugally\nsupported disk forms around the NS upon collapse. We calculate the subsequent\nevolution of this accretion disk using time-dependent height-integrated\nsimulations with initial conditions taken from the AIC calculations of Dessart\net al. (2006). Initially, the disk is cooled by neutrinos and its composition\nis driven neutron-rich (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.1) by electron captures.\nHowever, as the disk viscously spreads, it is irradiated by neutrinos from the\ncentral proto-NS, which dramatically alters its neutron-to-proton ratio. We\nfind that electron neutrino captures increase Ye to ~ 0.5 by the time that weak\ninteractions in the disk freeze out. Because the disk becomes radiatively\ninefficient and begins forming alpha-particles soon after freeze out, powerful\nwinds blow away most of the disk's remaining mass. These Ye ~ 0.5 outflows\nsynthesize up to a few times 1e-2 Msun in 56Ni. As a result, AIC may be\naccompanied by a radioactively powered SN-like transient that peaks on a\ntimescale of ~ 1 day. Since few intermediate mass elements are likely\nsynthesized, these Ni-rich explosions should be spectroscopically distinct from\nother SNe. PanSTARRs and the Palomar Transient Factory should detect a few AIC\ntransients per year if their true rate is ~1/100 of the Type Ia rate, and LSST\nshould detect hundreds per year.

In total, PAH features\nare detected toward at most 1 out of 63 (candidate) embedded protostars (<~\n2%), even lower than observed for class II T Tauri stars with disks (11-14%).\nAssuming typical class I stellar and envelope parameters, the absence of PAHs\nemission is most likely explained by the absence of emitting carriers through a\nPAH abundance at least an order of magnitude lower than in molecular clouds but\nsimilar to that found in disks. Thus, most PAHs likely enter the protoplanetary\ndisks frozen out in icy layers on dust grains and/or in coagulated form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 21:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this work we present multi-line\nobservations of CS, C34S, HNCO and C18O in a sample of 11 bright galaxies\nprototypical for different types of activity. The 32S/34S isotopic ratio is\n~10, supporting the idea of an isotopical 34S enrichment due to massive star\nformation in the nuclear regions of galaxies. Although C32S and C34S do not\nseem to be significantly affected by the activity type, the HNCO abundance\nappears highly contrasted among starburst. We observed HNCO abundance\nvariations of nearly two orders of magnitude. The HNCO molecule is shown to be\na good tracer of the amount of molecular material fueling the starburst and\ntherefore can be used as a diagnostics of the evolutionary state of a nuclear\nstarburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2008 00:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In this work, a more general\nscenario is considered where the change propagates across the sensors, and its\npropagation can be modeled as a Markov process. A centralized, Bayesian version\nof this problem, with a fusion center that has perfect information about the\nobservations and a priori knowledge of the statistics of the change process, is\nconsidered. The problem of minimizing the average detection delay subject to\nfalse alarm constraints is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (POMDP).

In the special case of near-instantaneous change\npropagation across the sensors, this condition reduces to the mild condition\nthat the K-L divergence be positive.

In this system, the interfacial instability is\ninduced by lateral vapor pressure fluctuation, which is in turn attributed to\nthe effect of phase change: evaporation occurs at a hotter portion of the\ninterface and condensation at a colder one. The high vapor pressure pushes the\ninterface downward and the low one pulls it upward. A set of equations\ndescribing the temporal evolution of the interface of the liquid-vapor layers\nis derived. This model neglects the effect of mass loss or gain at the\ninterface and guarantees the mass conservation of the liquid layer. The result\nof linear stability analysis of the model shows that the presence of the\npressure dependence of the local saturation temperature mitigates the growth of\nlong-wave disturbances.

Recent advances in\nbuilding molecular-electronics devices and nanoelectromechanical systems open a\nnew arena for studying the interaction between mechanical and electronic\ndegrees of freedom in transport at the single-molecule level. The tunneling of\nelectrons through molecules or suspended quantum dots has been shown to excite\nvibrational modes, or vibrons.

This allows us to unambiguously demonstrate the\nFranck-Condon blockade in a suspended nanostructure.
