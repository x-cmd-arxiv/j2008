It is well known that at high\ntemperature ($\\beta < 1$) the mixing time is $\\Theta(n\\log n)$, whereas at low\ntemperature ($\\beta > 1$) it is $\\exp(\\Theta(n))$. Recently, Levin, Luczak and\nPeres considered a censored version of this dynamics, which is restricted to\nnon-negative magnetization. They proved that for fixed $\\beta > 1$, the\nmixing-time of this model is $\\Theta(n\\log n)$, analogous to the\nhigh-temperature regime of the original dynamics. Furthermore, they showed\n\\emph{cutoff} for the original dynamics for fixed $\\beta<1$. The question\nwhether the censored dynamics also exhibits cutoff remained unsettled.\n  In a companion paper, we extended the results of Levin et al. into a complete\ncharacterization of the mixing-time for the Currie-Weiss model. Namely, we\nfound a scaling window of order $1/\\sqrt{n}$ around the critical temperature\n$\\beta_c=1$, beyond which there is cutoff at high temperature. However,\ndetermining the behavior of the censored dynamics outside this critical window\nseemed significantly more challenging.\n  In this work we answer the above question in the affirmative, and establish\nthe cutoff point and its window for the censored dynamics beyond the critical\nwindow, thus completing its analogy to the original dynamics at high\ntemperature. Namely, if $\\beta = 1 + \\delta$ for some $\\delta > 0$ with\n$\\delta^2 n \\to \\infty$, then the mixing-time has order $(n /\n\\delta)\\log(\\delta^2 n)$. The cutoff constant is $(1/2+[2(\\zeta^2 \\beta /\n\\delta - 1)]^{-1})$, where $\\zeta$ is the unique positive root of\n$g(x)=\\tanh(\\beta x)-x$, and the cutoff window has order $n / \\delta$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 20:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

By measuring the\nellipticities of large numbers of background galaxies, the subtle gravitational\ndistortion called \"cosmic shear\" can be measured and used to constrain dark\nenergy parameters. The observed galaxy ellipticities, however, are induced not\nby shear but by reduced shear, which also accounts for slight magnifications of\nthe images. This distinction is negligible for present weak lensing surveys,\nbut it will become more important as we improve our ability to measure and\nunderstand small-angle cosmic shear modes. I calculate the discrepancy between\nshear and reduced shear in the context of power spectra and cross spectra,\nfinding the difference could be as high as 10% on the smallest accessible\nangular scales. I estimate how this difference will bias dark energy parameters\nobtained from two weak lensing methods: weak lensing tomography and the shear\nratio method known as offset-linear scaling. For weak lensing tomography,\nignoring the effects of reduced shear will cause future surveys considered by\nthe Dark Energy Task Force to measure dark energy parameters that are biased by\namounts comparable to their error bars. I advocate that reduced shear be\nproperly accounted for in such surveys, and I provide a semi-analytic formula\nfor doing so. Since reduced shear cross spectra do not follow an offset-linear\nscaling relation, the shear ratio method is similarly biased but with smaller\nsignificance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 18:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We attempt to identify very steep spectrum sources which are likely\nto be either relic sources or high-redshift objects as well as inverted-spectra\nobjects which could be Giga-Hertz Peaked Spectrum objects. We present the\nsource counts, and report the possibility of a flattening in the normalized\ndifferential counts at low flux densities which has so far been reported at\nhigher radio frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 21:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Thus, molecular noise that often results in phenotypic\nand population-dynamic consequences sets a fundamental limit to biochemical\nsignaling. While there have been numerous studies correlating the architecture\nof cellular reaction networks with noise tolerance, only a limited effort has\nbeen made to understand the dynamic role of protein-protein interactions. Here\nwe have developed a fully stochastic model for the positive feedback control of\na single gene, as well as a pair of genes (toggle switch), integrating\nquantitative results from previous in vivo and in vitro studies. We find that\nthe overall noise-level is reduced and the frequency content of the noise is\ndramatically shifted to the physiologically irrelevant high-frequency regime in\nthe presence of protein dimerization. This is independent of the choice of\nmonomer or dimer as transcription factor and persists throughout the multiple\nmodel topologies considered. For the toggle switch, we additionally find that\nthe presence of a protein dimer, either homodimer or heterodimer, may\nsignificantly reduce its random switching rate. Hence, the dimer promotes the\nrobust function of bistable switches by preventing the uninduced (induced)\nstate from randomly being induced (uninduced). The specific binding between\nregulatory proteins provides a buffer that may prevent the propagation of\nfluctuations in genetic activity. The capacity of the buffer is a non-monotonic\nfunction of association-dissociation rates. Since the protein oligomerization\nper se does not require extra protein components to be expressed, it provides a\nbasis for the rapid control of intrinsic or extrinsic noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 01:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-19"}

A comparison with the one-way QFAs is made\nby some examples; (2) we prove that a $k_{1}$-letter QFA ${\\cal A}_1$ and\nanother $k_{2}$-letter QFA ${\\cal A}_2$ are equivalent if and only if they are\n$(n_{1}+n_{2})^{4}+k-1$-equivalent, and the time complexity of determining the\nequivalence of two multi-letter QFAs using this method is\n$O(n^{12}+k^{2}n^{4}+kn^{8})$, where $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are the numbers of\nstates of ${\\cal A}_{1}$ and ${\\cal A}_{2}$, respectively, and\n$k=\\max(k_{1},k_{2})$. Some other issues are addressed for further\nconsideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 03:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2008 04:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2009 19:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-10"}

We re-address the issue of\nthe Galactic metallicity gradient and its time evolution by comparing the\nempirical gradients traced by a sample of 45 open clusters with a chemical\nevolution model of the Galaxy. At variance with previous similar studies, we\nhave collected from the literature only abundances derived from\nhigh--resolution spectra. The clusters have distances $7 < RGC<22$ kpc and ages\nfrom $\\sim 30$ Myr to 11 Gyr. We also consider the $\\alpha$-elements Si, Ca,\nTi, and the iron-peak elements Cr and Ni. The data for iron-peak and\n$\\alpha$-elements indicate a steep metallicity gradient for R_GC<12$ kpc and a\nplateau at larger radii. The time evolution of the metallicity distribution is\ncharacterized by a uniform increase of the metallicity at all radii, preserving\nthe shape of the gradient, with marginal evidence for a flattening of the\ngradient with time in the radial range 7-12 kpc. Our model is able to reproduce\nthe main features of the metallicity gradient and its evolution with an infall\nlaw exponentially decreasing with radius and with a collapse time scale of the\norder of 8 Gyr at the solar radius. This results in a rapid collapse in the\ninner regions, i.e. $R_{\\rm GC}\\lesssim 12$ kpc (that we associate with an\nearly phase of disk formation from the collapse of the halo) and in a slow\ninflow of material per unit area in the outer regions at a constant rate with\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 15:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Mode\nidentifications are used to interpret these results.\n  Statistical analyses of several Delta Scuti stars (FG Vir, 44 Tau, BL Cam and\nothers) show that the photometrically observed frequencies are not distributed\nat random, but that the excited nonradial modes cluster around the frequencies\nof the radial modes over many radial orders.\n  The observed regularities can be partly explained by modes trapped in the\nstellar envelope.

For alpha smaller than a certain\nthreshold alpha_0, which is larger than 2 and depends on the ratio J/g, the\nground state consists of an ordered sequence of segments with equal length and\nalternating magnetization. The width of the segments depends on both alpha and\nthe ratio J/g.

The resulting Casimir-like force acquires universal features upon\napproaching a critical point of the medium and becomes long-ranged at\ncriticality.

Then we show that, even in the case of the presence of vorticity, it\nis also possible to obtain, for a large class of systems, a Schrodinger-like\nequation of the vectorial field type from the continuity and Euler equations\nincluding a quantum potential. The same kind of transformation also applies to\na classical charged fluid subjected to an electromagnetic field and to an\nadditional potential having the form of a quantum potential.

The 3D phase diagrams for the magnetic order, and for the\nsuperconducting order extended to all cuprates families are described. We\npropose a formula able to describe the Tc (delta,eta) surface, this permits to\nidentify the stripe quantum critical point at (delta)c=1/8 and (eta)c =7percent\nwhich is associated with the incommensurate to commensurate stripe phase\ntransition, controlled by the misfit strain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 14:53:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2008 15:37:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 May 2009 18:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-11"}

Within the examined range of\npolymer concentrations, the samples ranged from fluids to gels. Already in the\nliquid phase the viscoelastic properties significantly changed when approaching\nthe gelation boundary, indicating the formation of clusters and transient\nnetworks. This is supported by an increasing correlation length of the density\nfluctuations, observed by static light scattering and microscopy. At the same\ntime, the correlation function determined by dynamic light scattering\ncompletely decays, indicating the absence of dynamical arrest. Upon increasing\nthe polymer concentration beyond the gelation boundary, the rheological\nproperties changed qualitatively again, now they are consistent with the\nformation of colloidal gels. Our experimental results, namely the location of\nthe gelation boundary as well as the elastic (storage) and viscous (loss)\nmoduli, are compared to different theoretical models. These include\nconsideration of the escape time as well as predictions for the viscoelastic\nmoduli based on scaling relations and Mode Coupling Theories (MCT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 14:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-05"}

The\nassumption of an axionic connector field which carries dual U(1) quantum\nnumbers, i.e., quantum numbers for the hypercharge $U(1)_Y$ and for the hidden\nsector gauge group $U(1)_X$, allows a non-trivial mixing between the mass\ngrowth for the neutral gauge vector bosons in the $SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ sector\nand the mass growth for the vector boson by the \\st mechanism in the $U(1)_X$\nsector. This results in an extra $Z'$ which can be very narrow, but still\ndetectable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The $U(1)_X$ extension of the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model is also considered and the role of the\nFayet-Illiopoulos term in such an extension discussed.

Two arbitrary parameters are introduced in these\nnonlocal symmetries by considering gauge invariance of the bilinear KP and\nbilinear BKP equations under the transformation $f\\longrightarrow\nfe^{ax+by+ct}$. By expanding these nonlocal symmetries in powers of each of two\nparameters, we have derived two types of bilinear NKP hierarchies and two types\nof bilinear NBKP hierarchies. An impressive observation is that bilinear\npositive and negative KP and BKP hierarchies may be derived from the same\nnonlocal symmetries for the KP and BKP equations. Besides, as two concrete\nexamples, we have deived bilinear B\\\"acklund transformations for $t_{-2}$-flow\nof the NKP hierarchy and $t_{-1}$-flow of the NBKP hierarchy. All these results\nhave made it clear that more nice integrable properties would be found for\nthese obtained NKP hierarchies and NBKP hierarchies. Since KP and BKP\nhierarchies have played an essential role in soliton theory, we believe that\nthe bilinear NKP and NBKP hierarchies will have their right place in this\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 15:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-02"}
