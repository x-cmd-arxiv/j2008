A\nstrategy was formulated to extract all measurable Wilson coefficients in B ->\nXs l+ l- from a few simple integrals of these observables in the low q^2\nregion. The experimental measurements in the low q^2 region require a cut on\nthe hadronic invariant mass, which introduces a dependence on nonperturbative b\nquark distribution functions.

However, the power spectra do show some\nsigns of quasi-periodic variability. Most importantly, the rotation frequency\nof the tongues and the resulting hotspots is close to the inner-disk orbital\nfrequency, except in the most strongly unstable cases. There is therefore a\nhigh probability of observing QPOs at that frequency in longer simulations.

Two main schemes have been\nproposed for such a 'first' detection: measurements of ellipticity acquired by\na linearly polarized beam of light passing through a magnetic field and direct\nlight-light scattering. The study of the propagation of light through an\nexternal field can also be used to probe for new physics such as the existence\nof axion-like particles and millicharged particles. Their existence in nature\nwould cause the index of refraction of vacuum to be different from unity in the\npresence of an external field and dependent of the polarization direction of\nthe light propagating. The major achievement of reaching the project\nsensitivities in gravitational wave interferometers such as LIGO an VIRGO has\nopened the possibility of using such instruments for the detection of QED\ncorrections in electrodynamics and for probing new physics at very low\nenergies. In this paper we discuss the difference between direct birefringence\nmeasurements and index of refraction measurements.

The effective action\ncorresponding to the trace of the triangle amplitude can be expressed in local\nform by the introduction of two scalar auxiliary fields which satisfy massless\nwave equations. These massless scalar degrees of freedom couple to classical\nsources, contribute to gravitational scattering processes, and can have long\nrange gravitational effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2008 20:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-27"}

We show that the production and successive decay of these heavy\nquarks into final states with same-sign dileptons, trileptons and four leptons,\ncan be easily seen above background with relatively low luminosity. On the\nother hand, in order to confirm the presence of a new strong interaction\nresponsible for fourth-generation condensation, we study its contribution to D4\npair-production, and the potential to separate it from standard QCD-induced\nheavy quark production. We show that this separation might require large\namounts of data. This is true even if it is assumed that the new interaction is\nmediated by a massive colored vector boson, since its strong coupling to the\nfourth generation renders its width of the order of its mass. We conclude that,\nalthough this class of models can be falsified at early stages of the LHC\nrunning, its confirmation would require high integrated luminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2008 21:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

A\nsample of 388 field stars as well as stars in globular clusters is used for a\ndirect comparison of the synthetic indices versus empirical data and for\nscrutinizing the possibilities of theoretical calibrations for temperature,\nmetallicity and gravity. We show that the temperature sensitivity of the\nsynthetic (b-y) colour is very close to its empirical counterpart, whereas the\ntemperature scale based upon Hbeta shows a slight offset. The theoretical\nmetallicity sensitivity of the m1 index (and for G-type stars its combination\nwith c1) is somewhat larger than the empirical one, based upon spectroscopic\ndeterminations. The gravity sensitivity of the synthetic c1 index shows a\nsatisfactory behaviour when compared to obervations of F stars. For stars\ncooler than the sun a deviation is significant in the c1-(b-y) diagram. The\ntheoretical calibrations of (b-y), (v-y) and c1 seem to work well for Pop II\nstars and lead to effective temperatures for globular cluster stars supporting\nrecent claims by Korn et al. (2007) that atomic diffusion occurs in stars near\nthe turnoff point of NGC 6397. Synthetic colours of stellar atmospheres can\nindeed be used, in many cases, to derive reliable fundamental stellar\nparameters. The deviations seen when compared to observational data could be\ndue to incomplete linelists but are possibly also due to effects of assuming\nplane-parallell or spherical geometry and LTE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2008 23:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The IR luminosity function in\nA3266 is very similar to that in the Coma cluster down to the detection limit\nL_IR~10^43 ergs/s, suggesting a universal form of the bright end IR LF for\nlocal rich clusters with M~10^15 M_sun. The shape of the bright end of the\nA3266-Coma composite IR LF is not significantly different from that of nearby\nfield galaxies, but the fraction of IR-bright galaxies (SFR > 0.2M_sun/yr) in\nboth clusters increases with cluster-centric radius. The decrease of the blue\ngalaxy fraction toward the high density cores only accounts for part of the\ntrend; the fraction of red galaxies with moderate SFRs (0.2 < SFR < 1 M_sun/yr)\nalso decreases with increasing galaxy density. These results suggest that for\nthe IR bright galaxies, nearby rich clusters are distinguished from the field\nby a lower star-forming galaxy fraction, but not by a change in L*_IR.

If the energy of a bound state of in the closed channel is\nfine-tuned to match the relative kinetic energy, then the open channel and the\nclosed channel \"resonate\", so that the scattering length becomes divergent. We\nfind that this so-called Feshbach resonance phenomenon not only exists during\nthe collisions of massive particles, but also emerges during the coherent\ntransport of massless particles, that is, photons confined in the coupled\nresonator arrays \\cite{lzhou08}. We implement the open and the closed channels\ninside a pair of such arrays, linked by a separated cavity or a tunable qubit.\nWhen a single photon is bounded inside the closed channel by setting the\nrelevant physical parameters appropriately, the vanishing transmission appears\nto display this photonic Feshbach resonance. The general construction can be\nimplemented through various experimentally feasible solid state systems, such\nas the couple defected cavities in photonic crystals. The numerical simulation\nbased on finite-different time-domain(FDTD) method confirms our conceive about\nphysical implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2008 04:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-03"}

This is in agreement with the observed $L_{X}/L_{UV}$ ratio\nand suggests a possible interpretation of the $\\alpha_{OX}-l_{UV}$\nanticorrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2008 11:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the resonant\natom-cavity regime and under the resonant modulation, the dynamics is similar\nto the one occurring for a stationary two-level atom in a vibrating cavity, and\nan entangled state with two photons can be created from vacuum. Moreover, we\nconsider the situation in which the atom-cavity coupling, the atomic frequency,\nor both have a small nonperiodic time modulation, and show that photons can be\ncreated from vacuum in the dispersive regime.

Via the\ngauge/gravity duality, the problem of the current interacting with the plasma\nis mapped onto the gravitational interaction between a Maxwell field and a\nblack hole embedded in the AdS_5 x S^5 geometry. The physical interpretation of\nthe AdS/CFT results can be then reconstructed with the help of the\nultraviolet/infrared correspondence. We thus deduce that, for sufficiently high\nenergy, the photon (or any other hard probe: a quark, a gluon, or a meson)\ndisappears into the plasma via a universal mechanism, which is quasi-democratic\nparton branching: the current develops a parton cascade such that, at any step\nin the branching process, the energy is almost equally divided among the\ndaughter partons. The branching rate is controlled by the plasma which acts on\nthe colored partons with a constant force ~ T^2. When reinterpreted in the\nplasma infinite momentum frame, the same AdS/CFT results suggest a parton\npicture for the plasma structure functions, in which all the partons have\nfallen at very small values of Bjorken's x. For a time-like current in the\nvacuum, quasi-democratic branching implies that there should be no jets in\nelectron-positron annihilation at strong coupling, but only a spatially\nisotropic distribution of hadronic matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2008 13:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-21"}
