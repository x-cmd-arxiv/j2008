When a block of biological soft tissue is subjected to large\nshear, it is likely that its surface in the plane of shear will buckle\n(apparition of wrinkles). One factor that distinguishes soft tissues from\nrubber-like solids is the presence -- sometimes visible to the naked eye -- of\noriented collagen fibre bundles, which are stiffer than the elastin matrix into\nwhich they are embedded but are nonetheless flexible and extensible. Here we\nshow that the simplest model of isotropic nonlinear elasticity, namely the\nincompressible neo-Hookean model, suffers surface instability in shear only at\ntremendous amounts of shear, i.e., above 3.09, which corresponds to a 72\ndegrees angle of shear. Next we incorporate a family of parallel fibres in the\nmodel and show that the resulting solid can be either reinforced or strongly\nweakened with respect to surface instability, depending on the angle between\nthe fibres and the direction of shear, and depending on the ratio E/mu between\nthe stiffness of the fibres and that of the matrix. For this ratio we use\nvalues compatible with experimental data on soft tissues. Broadly speaking, we\nfind that the surface becomes rapidly unstable when the shear takes place\n\"against\" the fibres, and that as E/mu increases, so does the sector of angles\nwhere early instability is expected to occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Dec 2008 23:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-09"}

A non-local, radiative transfer code based\non the ALI formalism is used. Results: The H2O abundance estimates are in\nagreement with previous estimates. The inclusion of the Odin data sets stronger\nconstraints on the size of the H2O envelope. The H2O(1_10 - 1_01) line profiles\nrequire a significant reduction in expansion velocity compared to the terminal\ngas expansion velocity determined in models of CO radio line emission,\nindicating that the H2O emission lines probe a region where the wind is still\nbeing accelerated. Including the nu3=1 state significantly lowers the estimated\nabundances for the low-mass-loss-rate objects. This shows the importance of\ndetailed modelling, in particular the details of the infrared spectrum in the\nrange 3 to 6 micron, to estimate accurate circumstellar H2O abundances.\nConclusions: Spectrally resolved circumstellar H2O emission lines are important\nprobes of the physics and chemistry in the inner regions of circumstellar\nenvelopes around asymptotic giant branch stars. Predictions for H2O emission\nlines in the spectral range of the upcoming Herschel/HIFI mission indicate that\nthese observations will be very important in this context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2008 11:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We show that the region of quantum critical fluctuations in the\ntwo variables phase diagram of cuprates: the doping (delta) and the chemical\npressure (i.e., the tolerance factor, or the average ionic radius of A-site\ncations) can be measured via the microstrain (eta) of the Cu-O length in the\nCuO2 lattice. The fluctuating order in the proximity of the microstrain quantum\ncritical point that competes with the superconducting long range order is the\npolaron electronic crystalline phase called a Wigner polaron crystal and the\nvariation of the spin gap energy as a function of microstrain provides a strong\nexperimental support for this proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2008 15:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
