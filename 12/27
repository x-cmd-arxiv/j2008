The first topic concerns weak measurements and their\nuniversality as a means of generating quantum operations. It is shown that\nevery generalized measurement can be implemented as a sequence of weak\n(infinitesimal) measurements. The second topic is an application of this result\nto the theory of entanglement. Necessary and sufficient differential conditions\nfor entanglement monotones are derived and are used to find a new entanglement\nmonotone for three-qubit states. The third topic is a study of the performance\nof different master equations for the description of non-Markovian dynamics.\nThe system studied is a qubit coupled to a spin bath via the Ising interaction.\nThe fourth topic investigates continuous QEC in the presence of non-Markovian\nnoise. It is shown that due to the existence of a Zeno regime in non-Markovian\ndynamics, the performance of continuous QEC exhibits a quadratic improvement\nfor a sufficiently high time resolution of the error-correcting operations. The\nfifth topic studies the conditions for correctability of subsystem codes under\ncontinuous dynamics. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the Lindbladian and\nthe system-environment Hamiltonian are derived. The sixth topic examines the\nrobustness of operator QEC codes against initialization errors. A new measure\nof fidelity for encoded information is introduced and is used to show that\noperator codes are robust against imperfect initialization without the need for\nrestriction of the standard operator QEC conditions. The last topic concerns\nholonomic quantum computation (HQC) and stabilizer codes. A fault-tolerant\nscheme for HQC is presented, proving the scalability of the holonomic approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Dec 2008 12:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-31"}

The dispersion relation for the Higgs-like\nmode features an imaginary part even at \"tree level\" as a consequence of the\nfact that the unparticle field describes a multiparticle continuum. Mixed\nunparticle-Higgs propagators reveal the possibility of oscillations, albeit\nwith short coherence lengths. The results are generalized to the case in which\nthe unparticle features a mass gap, in which case a low energy MSW resonance\nmay occur for lightlike momenta depending on the scales. Unparticle-Higgs\nmixing leads to an effective unparticle potential of the new-inflation form.\nSlow-roll variables are suppressed by seesaw ratios and the anomalous\ndimensions and favor a red spectrum of scalar perturbations consistent with\ncosmic microwave background data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Dec 2008 02:44:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2009 18:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-23"}

The assumption made throughout is\nthat a packet is received successfully only if the Signal to Interference and\nNoise Ratio (SINR) at the receiver exceeds the communication threshold. The\nthesis also discusses the complementary problem of flow control. (1) We\nconsider various problems on centralized link scheduling in Spatial Time\nDivision Multiple Access (STDMA) wireless mesh networks. We motivate the use of\nspatial reuse as performance metric and provide an explicit characterization of\nspatial reuse. We propose link scheduling algorithms based on certain graph\nmodels (communication graph, SINR graph) of the network. Our algorithms achieve\nhigher spatial reuse than that of existing algorithms, with only a slight\nincrease in computational complexity. (2) We investigate random access\nalgorithms in wireless networks. We assume that the receiver is capable of\npower-based capture and propose a splitting algorithm that varies transmission\npowers of users on the basis of quaternary channel feedback. We model the\nalgorithm dynamics by a Discrete Time Markov Chain and consequently show that\nits maximum stable throughput is 0.5518. Our algorithm achieves higher maximum\nstable throughput and significantly lower delay than the First Come First Serve\n(FCFS) splitting algorithm with uniform transmission power. (3) We consider the\nproblem of flow control in packet networks from an information-theoretic\nperspective. We derive the maximum entropy of a flow which conforms to traffic\nconstraints imposed by a generalized token bucket regulator (GTBR), by taking\ninto account the covert information present in randomness of packet lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Dec 2008 13:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-31"}
