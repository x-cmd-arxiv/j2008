Recently Ueta et al. and Batcheldor\net al. have suggested that NICMOS possesses a residual instrumental\npolarization at a level of 1.2-1.5%. This would completely inhibit the data\nreduction in a number of GO programs, and hamper the ability of the instrument\nto perform high accuracy polarimetry. We obtained polarimetric calibration\nobservations of three polarimetric standards at three spacecraft roll angles\nseparated by ~60deg. Combined with archival data, these observations were used\nto characterize the residual instrumental polarization in order for NICMOS to\nreach its full potential of accurate imaging polarimetry at p~1%. Using these\ndata, we place an 0.6% upper limit on the instrumental polarization and\ncalculate values of the parallel transmission coefficients that reproduce the\nground-based results for the polarimetric standards. The uncertainties\nassociated with the parallel transmission coefficients, a result of the\nphotometric repeatability of the observations, are seen to dominate the\naccuracy of p and theta. However, the updated coefficients do allow imaging\npolarimetry of targets with p~1.0% at an accuracy of +/-0.6% and +/-15deg.

We review\nthe formation of the Galilean satellites in the context of current constraints\nand understanding of giant planet formation, focusing on recent models of\nsatellite growth within a circumjovian accretion disk produced during the final\nstages of gas inflow to Jupiter. In such a disk, the Galilean satellites would\nhave accreted slowly, in more than 10^5 yr, and in a low pressure, low gas\ndensity environment. Gravitational interactions between the satellites and the\ngas disk lead to inward orbital migration and loss of satellites to Jupiter.\nSuch effects tend to select for a maximum satellite mass and a common total\nsatellite system mass compared to the planet's mass. One implication is that\nmultiple satellite systems may have formed and been lost during the final\nstages of Jupiter's growth, with the Galilean satellites being the last\ngeneration that survived as gas inflow to Jupiter ended. We conclude by\ndiscussing open issues and implications for Europa's conditions of formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2008 01:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-31"}

Such analyses\ndiscard fundamental aspects of science as prescribed by Karl Popper. Indeed,\nnot without cause, Popper (1978) once argued that evolutionary biology was\nunscientific as its hypotheses were untestable. Here we trace developments in\nassessing fit from Penny et al. (1982) to the present. We compare the general\nlog-likelihood ratio (the G or G2 statistic) statistic between the evolutionary\ntree model and the multinomial model with that of marginalized tests applied to\nan alignment (using placental mammal coding sequence data). It is seen that the\nmost general test does not reject the fit of data to model (p~0.5), but the\nmarginalized tests do. Tests on pair-wise frequency (F) matrices, strongly (p <\n0.001) reject the most general phylogenetic (GTR) models commonly in use. It is\nalso clear (p < 0.01) that the sequences are not stationary in their nucleotide\ncomposition. Deviations from stationarity and homogeneity seem to be unevenly\ndistributed amongst taxa; not necessarily those expected from examining other\nregions of the genome. By marginalizing the 4t patterns of the i.i.d. model to\nobserved and expected parsimony counts, that is, from constant sites, to\nsingletons, to parsimony informative characters of a minimum possible length,\nthen the likelihood ratio test regains power, and it too rejects the\nevolutionary model with p << 0.001. Given such behavior over relatively recent\nevolutionary time, readers in general should maintain a healthy skepticism of\nresults, as the scale of the systematic errors in published analyses may really\nbe far larger than the analytical methods (e.g., bootstrap) report.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2008 05:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-31"}

We indicate\nthat whenever the pinning is allowed by the symmetry, its strength is an\noscillatory function of the external magnetic field. In the magnetic fields for\nwhich the pinning is maximal the dipole moment generated by the persistent\ncurrents changes orientation from antiparallel to parallel to the external\nfield in a continuous manner. For confinement potentials of a higher symmetry\nthan the one of a classical Wigner molecule the pinning is forbidden and a\ndiscontinuous abrupt inversion of the dipole moments is observed. When the\npinning of single-electron islands is absent or weak the current distribution\nresembles the one of a circular ring. For the maximal pinning instead of\ncurrent loops running around the entire ring one observes formation of multiple\ncurrent vortices circulating around each single-electron density island. We\nstudy the magnetic field generated by persistent currents and find that at the\ndipole moment reversal the currents tend to screen the external field in the\nregion occupied by electrons.

People have long before\nnoticed the weakness of the convex $l_1$-constraint (or the soft-thresholding)\nin wavelets and have designed many different forms of nonconvex penalties to\nincrease model sparsity and accuracy. But for a nonorthogonal regression\nmatrix, there is great difficulty in both investigating the performance in\ntheory and solving the problem in computation. TISP provides a simple and\nefficient way to tackle this so that we successfully borrow the rich results in\nthe orthogonal design to solve the nonconvex penalized regression for a general\ndesign matrix. Our starting point is, however, thresholding rules rather than\npenalty functions. Indeed, there is a universal connection between them. But a\ndrawback of the latter is its non-unique form, and our approach greatly\nfacilitates the computation and the analysis. In fact, we are able to build the\nconvergence theorem and explore theoretical properties of the selection and\nestimation via TISP nonasymptotically. More importantly, a novel Hybrid-TISP is\nproposed based on hard-thresholding and ridge-thresholding. It provides a\nfusion between the $l_0$-penalty and the $l_2$-penalty, and adaptively achieves\nthe right balance between shrinkage and selection in statistical modeling.

We consider a fiducial survey with 9-filter set and perform photo-z\nmeasurement simulations. It is found that a fraction of 1% galaxies at\nz_{spec}~0.4 is misidentified to be at z_{phot}~3.5. We then employ both chi^2\nfitting method and the extension of Fisher matrix formalism to evaluate the\nbias on the equation of state parameters of dark energy, w_0 and w_a, induced\nby those catastrophic outliers. By comparing the results from both methods, we\nverify that the estimation of w_0 and w_a from the fiducial 5-bin tomographic\nanalyses can be significantly biased. To minimize the impact of this bias, two\nstrategies can be followed: (A) the cosmic shear analysis is restricted to\n0.5<z<2.5 where catastrophic redshift errors are expected to be insignificant;\n(B) a spectroscopic survey is conducted for galaxies with 3<z_{phot}<4. We find\nthat the number of spectroscopic redshifts needed scales as N_{spec} \\propto\nf_{cata}\\times A where f_{cata}=1% is the fraction of catastrophic redshift\nerrors (assuming a 9-filter photometric survey) and A is the survey area. For\nA=1000 {deg}^2, we find that N_{spec}>320 and 860 respectively in order to\nreduce the joint bias in (w_0,w_a) to be smaller than 2\\sigma and 1\\sigma. This\nspectroscopic survey (option B) will improve the Figure of Merit of option A by\na factor \\times 1.5 thus making such a survey strongly desirable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2008 15:37:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 06:19:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 10:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

While there is a rich literature in estimating a static or\ntemporally invariant network from observation data, little has been done toward\nestimating time-varying networks from time series of entity attributes. In this\npaper we present two new machine learning methods for estimating time-varying\nnetworks, which both build on a temporally smoothed $l_1$-regularized logistic\nregression formalism that can be cast as a standard convex-optimization problem\nand solved efficiently using generic solvers scalable to large networks. We\nreport promising results on recovering simulated time-varying networks.

There is a one-parameter family of charged black holes, where\nthe magnitude of the charge is uniquely determined by the black hole area.\nThese black holes are thermodynamically stable and become extremal in the limit\nof vanishing size.
