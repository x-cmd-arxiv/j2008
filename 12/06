We review the quantization of the SU(3) rotations of the Skyrmion,\nleading to the exotic baryons that cannot be made of three quarks. It is shown\nthat in the limit of large number of colours the lowest-mass exotic baryons can\nbe studied from the kaon-Skyrmion scattering amplitudes, an approach known\nafter Callan and Klebanov. We follow this approach and find, both analytically\nand numerically, a strong Theta+ resonance in the scattering amplitude that is\ntraced to the rotational mode. The Skyrme model does predict an exotic\nresonance Theta+ but grossly overestimates the width. To understand better the\nfactors affecting the width, it is computed by several methods giving, however,\nidentical results. In particular, we show that insofar as the width is small,\nit can be found from the transition axial constant. The physics leading to a\nnarrow Theta+ resonance is briefly reviewed and affirmed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2008 20:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-08"}

We demonstrate that there are two distinct\nregimes of black hole growth in nearby galaxies. The first is associated with\ngalaxies with significant star formation in their central kiloparsec regions,\nand is characterized by a broad log-normal distribution of accretion rates\npeaked at about one percent of the Eddington limit. In this regime, the\nEddington ratio distribution is independent of the mass of the black hole and\nshows no further dependence on the central stellar population of the galaxy.\nThe second regime is associated with galaxies with old central stellar\npopulations, and is characterized by a power-law distribution function of\nEddington ratios. In this regime, the time-averaged mass accretion rate onto\nblack holes is proportional to the mass of stars in the galaxy bulge, with a\nconstant of proportionality that depends on the mean stellar age of the stars.\nThis result is once again independent of black hole mass. We show that both the\nslope of the power-law and the decrease in the accretion rate onto black holes\nin old galaxies are consistent with population synthesis model predictions of\nthe decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of mean stellar age. Our\nresults lead to a very simple picture of black hole growth in the local\nUniverse. If the supply of cold gas in a galaxy bulge is plentiful, the black\nhole regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further depend on the\nproperties of the interstellar medium.

We consider both the independently decodable data units\n(DUs, e.g. packets) and the interdependent DUs whose dependencies are captured\nby a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We first formulate the cross-layer design as\na non-linear constrained optimization problem by assuming complete knowledge of\nthe application characteristics and the underlying network conditions. The\nconstrained cross-layer optimization is decomposed into several cross-layer\noptimization subproblems for each DU and two master problems. The proposed\ndecomposition method determines the necessary message exchanges between layers\nfor achieving the optimal cross-layer solution. However, the attributes (e.g.\ndistortion impact, delay deadline etc) of future DUs as well as the network\nconditions are often unknown in the considered real-time applications. The\nimpact of current cross-layer actions on the future DUs can be characterized by\na state-value function in the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. Based on\nthe dynamic programming solution to the MDP, we develop a low-complexity\ncross-layer optimization algorithm using online learning for each DU\ntransmission.

The dominant length\nscale governing the induction zone turns out to be approximately half the\nhorizontal wave length of the incident mode, a result that fits in quite\npleasantly with extant theories of scattering. Higher-$\\beta$ flux tubes are\nmore strongly coupled than weaker ones, a consequence of the greater role that\nthe near-field jacket modes play in the such tubes.
