In this paper we extend\nthis formulation to include temporally-ordered collections of propositions as\nopposed to single-time propositions. That is to say, we have developed a\nquantum history formalism in the language of topos theory where truth values\ncan be assigned to temporal propositions. We analyse the extent to which such\ntruth values can be derived from the truth values of the constituent,\nsingle-time propositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2008 21:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-09"}

Starting with the work of Cole\nand Vishkin in 86, there was a long line of gradually improving algorithms\npublished. The current state-of-the-art running time is O(Delta log Delta +\nlog^* n), due to Kuhn and Wattenhofer, PODC'06. Linial (FOCS'87) has proved a\nlower bound of 1/2 \\log^* n for the problem, and Szegedy and Vishwanathan\n(STOC'93) provided a heuristic argument that shows that algorithms from a wide\nfamily of locally iterative algorithms are unlikely to achieve running time\nsmaller than \\Theta(Delta log Delta).\n  We present a deterministic (Delta + 1)-coloring distributed algorithm with\nrunning time O(Delta) + 1/2 log^* n. We also present a tradeoff between the\nrunning time and the number of colors, and devise an O(Delta * t)-coloring\nalgorithm with running time O(Delta / t + \\log^* n), for any parameter t, 1 < t\n< Delta^{1-epsilon}, for an arbitrarily small constant epsilon, 0 < epsilon <\n1.\n  On the way to this result we study a generalization of the notion of graph\ncoloring, which is called defective coloring. In an m-defective p-coloring the\nvertices are colored with p colors so that each vertex has up to m neighbors\nwith the same color. We show that an m-defective p-coloring with reasonably\nsmall m and p can be computed very efficiently. We also develop a technique to\nemploy multiple defect colorings of various subgraphs of the original graph G\nfor computing a (Delta+1)-coloring of G. We believe that these techniques are\nof independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2008 20:44:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 2008 10:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-26"}

In particular, we calculate the\nminimum bridge number of a knot as a function of the maximum depth invariant d\nof its tunnels. The growth of this value is on the order of (1+\\sqrt{2})^d. We\nalso find the maximum bridge number as a function of the number of cabling\nconstructions needed to produce the tunnel, showing in particular that the\nmaximum bridge number of a knot produced by n cabling constructions is the\n(n+2)nd Fibonacci number.

A\ndirect Schechter function fit to the combined cluster MF for all spirals in the\nsample studied here yields Mc = (2.1+/-0.4)x10^5 Msun. The MFs in cluster-poor\nand cluster-rich spirals are statistically indistinguishable. An Mc=2.1x10^5\nMsun Schechter function also fits the MF of young clusters in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud. If the same ICMF applies in the Milky Way, a bound cluster\nwith M>10^5 Msun will form about once every 10 Myr, while an M>10^6 Msun\ncluster will form only once every 50 Gyr.

Suzaku detected\nX-ray signals in the wide energy band from 0.5 to 40 keV. The hard X-ray (> 10\nkeV) flux observed by the HXD around the cluster center cannot be explained by\na simple extension of the thermal emission with average temperature of ~7 keV.\nThe emission is most likely an emission from a very hot (kT > 13.2 keV) thermal\ncomponent around the cluster center, produced via a strong heating process in\nthe merger. In the north-west radio relic, no signature of non-thermal emission\nwas observed. Using the HXD, the overall upper-limit flux within a 34'x34'\nfield-of-view around the relic is derived to be 5.3e-12 erg s-1 cm-2 in the\n10-40 keV band, after subtracting the ICM contribution estimated using the XIS\nor the XMM-Newton spectra. Directly on the relic region, the upper limit is\nfurther tightened by the XIS data to be less than 7.3e-13 erg s-1 cm-2, when\nconverted into the 10--40 keV band.

This\ncoupled model is investigated in the general setting where physical space is an\noriented Riemannian manifold and the target space is a Kaehler manifold. It is\nshown that supercurrent coupling destroys the topological stability enjoyed by\nthe usual Faddeev-Skyrme model, so that there can be no globally stable knot\nsolitons in this model.

Trans-coordinate physics proceeds differently\nby not introducing space-time coordinates in the first place. Differentials\ntaken from a novel limiting process are defined for a particle's wave function,\nallowing the particle's dynamic principle to operate locally without the use of\ncoordinates. These differentials replace the covariant differentials of\nRiemannian geometry. With coordinates out of the way regional conservation\nprinciples and the Einstein field equation are no longer fundamentally defined;\nalthough they are constructible along with coordinate systems so they continue\nto be analytically useful. Gravity waves as presently understood are not\ndefined, so we conclude that the gravitational detectors LIGO and Weber bar\nwill not work. We assume that gravitons alone are fundamentally responsible for\ngravity. It is shown how gravitational uncertainty can be reconciled with the\ncertainty of quantum mechanical dynamics.

A particularly powerful aspect of the IST is\nits ability to predict the large $t$ behavior of the solution. Namely, starting\nwith initial data $u(x,0)$, IST implies that the solution $u(x,t)$ asymptotes\nto a collection of solitons as $t \\to \\infty$, $x/t = O(1)$; moreover the\nshapes and speeds of these solitons can be computed from $u(x,0)$ using only\n{\\it linear} operations. One of the most important developments in this area\nhas been the generalization of the IST from initial to initial-boundary value\n(IBV) problems formulated on the half-line. It can be shown that again $u(x,t)$\nasymptotes into a collection of solitons, where now the shapes and the speeds\nof these solitons depend both on $u(x,0)$ and on the given boundary conditions\nat $x = 0$. A major complication of IBV problems is that the computation of the\nshapes and speeds of the solitons involves the solution of a {\\it nonlinear}\nVolterra integral equation. However, for a certain class of boundary\nconditions, called linearizable, this complication can be bypassed and the\nrelevant computation is as effective as in the case of the problem on the line.\nHere, after reviewing the general theory for KdV, we analyze three different\ntypes of linearizable boundary conditions. For these cases, the initial\nconditions are: (a) restrictions of one and two soliton solutions at $t = 0$;\n(b) profiles of certain exponential type; (c) box-shaped profiles. For each of\nthese cases, by computing explicitly the shapes and the speeds of the\nasymptotic solitons, we elucidate the influence of the boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2008 14:57:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 08:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}
