The paper develops a mathematical\ntheory of a vascular network response to local effects on scales of individual\nunits of peripheral circulation.\n  First, it formulates a model for the self-processing of information about the\ncellular tissue state and cooperative interaction of blood vessels governing\nredistribution of blood flow over the vascular network. Mass conservation\n(conservation of blood flow as well as transported biochemical compounds) plays\nthe key role in implementing these processes. The vascular network is\nconsidered to be of the tree form and the blood vessels are assumed to respond\nindividually to an activator in blood flowing though them.\n  Second, the constructed governing equations are analyzed numerically. It is\nshown that at the first approximation the blood perfusion rate depends locally\non the activator concentration in the cellular tissue, which is due to the\nhierarchical structure of the vascular network. Then the distinction between\nthe reaction threshold of individual vessels and that of the vascular network\nas a whole is demonstrated. In addition, the nonlocal component of the\ndependence of the blood perfusion rate on the activator concentration is found\nto change its form as the activator concentration increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 2008 17:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

To demonstrate how the spectral action\nencodes the dynamics of gravity we examine the accuracy of the approximation of\nthe spectral action by its asymptotic expansion in the case of the round three\nsphere.

The velocity gradient\nin the CO(1-0) emission shows that the molecular gas rotates like the thicker\nof the two stellar discs, which is an unexpected alignment of rotations if the\nthinner disc was formed by a major gas accretion event. However, a simulation\nshows that the gas rotating like the thicker disc naturally results from the\ncoplanar merger of two counter-rotating disc galaxies, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of this scenario for the formation of NGC 4550. We investigate\nvarious star formation tracers to determine whether the molecular gas in NGC\n4550 is currently forming stars. UV imaging data and optical absorption\nlinestrengths both suggest a recent star formation episode; the best-fitting\ntwo population model to the UV-optical colours yields a mass of young stars of\n5.9 x 10^7 solar masses with an age of 280 Myr. The best information on the\ncurrent star formation rate is a far infrared-based upper limit of only 0.02\nsolar masses per year. We are thus witnessing NGC 4550 either in a dip within a\nbursty star formation period or during a more continuous low-level star\nformation episode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 2008 22:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The model\nrepresents the acoustic energy dissipated in terms of Rayleigh dissipation\nfunctional that depends on the local strain rate. We show that the nature of\nthe peel front exhibits rich spatiotemporal patterns ranging from smooth,\nrugged and stuck-peeled configurations that depend on three parameters, namely,\nthe ratio of inertial time scale of the tape mass to that of the roller, the\ndissipation coefficient and the pull velocity. The stuck-peeled configurations\nare reminiscent of fibrillar peel front patterns observed in experiments. We\nshow that while the intermittent peeling is controlled by the peel force\nfunction, the model acoustic energy dissipated depends on the nature of the\npeel front and its dynamical evolution. Even though the acoustic energy is a\nfully dynamical quantity, it can be quite noisy for a certain set of parameter\nvalues suggesting the deterministic origin of acoustic emission in experiments.\nTo verify this suggestion, we have carried out a dynamical analysis of\nexperimental acoustic emission time series for a wide range of traction\nvelocities. Our analysis shows an unambiguous presence of chaotic dynamics\nwithin a subinterval of pull speeds within the intermittent regime. Time series\nanalysis of the model acoustic energy signals is also found to be chaotic\nwithin a subinterval of pull speeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2008 06:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

For a certain class of time\nevolutions it is this mere restriction to coarse-grained measurements which is\nsufficient to see the natural emergence of macroscopic realism and even the\nclassical Newtonian laws out of the full quantum formalism.

This upper bound on the mass loss rate is known as the photon-tiring\nlimit. Once above this limit, the radiation field is unable to lift all the\nmaterial out of the gravitational potential of the star, such that only part of\nit can escape and reach infinity. The rest stalls and falls back toward the\nstellar surface, making a steady-state wind impossible. Photon-tiring is not an\nissue for line-driven winds since they cannot achieve sufficiently high mass\nloss rates. It can however become important if the star exceeds the Eddington\nlimit and continuum interaction becomes the dominant driving mechanism.\n  This paper investigates the time-dependent behaviour of stellar winds that\nexceed the photon-tiring limit, using 1-D numerical simulations of a porosity\nmoderated, continuum-driven stellar wind. We find that the regions close to the\nstar show a hierarchical pattern of high density shells moving back and forth,\nunable to escape the gravitational potential of the star. At larger distances,\nthe flow eventually becomes uniformly outward, though still quite variable.\nTypically, these winds have a very high density but a terminal flow speed well\nbelow the escape speed at the stellar surface. Since most of the radiative\nluminosity of the star is used to drive the stellar wind, such stars would\nappear much dimmer than expected from the super-Eddington energy generation at\ntheir core. The visible luminosity typically constitutes less then half of the\ntotal energy flow and can become as low as ten percent or less for those stars\nthat exceed the photon-tiring limit by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2008 11:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The sample is used to explore properties of prominent lines in\nthe Hbeta spectral region of these very luminous quasars. We find two major\ntrends: (1) a systematic increase of minimum FWHM Hbeta with luminosity\n(discussed in a previous paper). This lower FWHM envelope is best fit assuming\nthat the narrowest sources radiate near the Eddington limit, show line emission\nfrom a virialized cloud distribution, and obey a well defined broad line region\nsize vs. luminosity relation. (2) A systematic decrease of equivalent width of\n[OIII] (from W ~ 15 to ~ 1 A) with increasing source bolometric luminosity\n(from log L ~ 43 to log L ~ 49). Further identified trends required\ndiscrimination between so-called Population A and B sources. We generate median\ncomposite spectra in six luminosity bins Pop. A sources show reasonably\nsymmetric Lorentzian Hbeta profiles at all luminosities while Pop. B sources\nrequire two component fits involving an unshifted broad and a redshifted very\nbroad component. Very broad Hbeta increases in strength with increasing L while\nthe broad component remains constant resulting in an apparent \"Baldwin effect\"\nwith equivalent width decreasing from W ~ 80 to ~ 20 A over our sample\nluminosity range. The roughly constant equivalent width shown by the Hbeta very\nbroad component implies production in optically-thick, photoionized gas. The\nonset of the redshifted very broad component appears to be a critical change\nthat occurs near the Pop.

In this note, we\npoint out that the capacity of a QCD medium to absorb the recoil of a partonic\nprojectile is an independent signature, which may differ for different media at\nthe same density. In particular, while the mass hierarchy (i.e., the projectile\nmass dependence) of radiative energy loss depends solely on a property of the\nprojectile, the mass hierarchy of collisional energy loss depends significantly\non properties of the medium. By varying these properties in a class of models,\nwe find that the mass hierarchy of collisional parton energy loss can be\nmodified considerably and can even be inverted, compared to that of radiative\nparton energy loss. This may help to disentangle the relative strengths of\nradiative and collisional contributions to jet quenching, and it may be\nemployed to constrain properties of the produced QCD medium beyond its density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2008 12:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

By working in 6D phase-space, where contrasts are\nmuch more pronounced than in 3D position space, our HSF algorithm is capable of\ndetecting subhaloes including their tidal tails, and can recognise other\nphase-space structures such as pure streams and candidate caustics.

As a test, we apply it to a large halo\nof the Millennium Simulation, where 19 % of the halo mass are found to belong\nto bound substructures, which is more than what is detected with conventional\n3D substructure finders, and an additional 23-36 % of the total mass belongs to\nunbound HSF structures.

The properties of the flare were\nderived by following the systematic cooling of the plasma through the response\nfunctions of a number of instruments -- RHESSI (>5 MK), GOES-12 (5-30 MK),\nTRACE 171 A (1 MK) and SOHO/CDS (~0.03-8 MK). These measurements were studied\nin combination with simulations from the 0-D EBTEL model. At the flare on-set,\nupflows of ~90 km s-1 and low level emission were observed in Fe XIX,\nconsistent with pre-flare heating and gentle chromospheric evaporation. During\nthe impulsive phase, upflows of ~80 km s-1 in Fe XIX and simultaneous downflows\nof 20 km s-1 in He I and O V were observed, indicating explosive chromospheric\nevaporation. The plasma was subsequently found to reach a peak temperature of\n~13 MK in approximately 10 minutes. Using EBTEL, conduction was found to be the\ndominant loss mechanism during the initial ~300s of the decay phase. It was\nalso found to be responsible for driving gentle chromospheric evaporation\nduring this period. As the temperature fell below ~8 MK, and for the next\n~4,000s, radiative losses were determined to dominate over conductive losses.\nThe radiative loss phase was accompanied by significant downflows of <40 km s-1\nin O V. This is the first extensive study of the evolution of a canonical solar\nflare using both spectroscopic and broad-band instruments in conjunction with a\nhydrodynamic model. While our results are in broad agreement with the standard\nflare model, the simulations suggest that both conductive and non-thermal beam\nheating play important roles in heating the flare plasma during the impulsive\nphase of at least this event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2008 15:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
