We\nillustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by its determination of the two\nlargest eigenvalues of the transfer matrices for variously-sized\ntwo-dimensional, zero field Ising models. While very likely useful for other\ntransfer matrix problems, the algorithm is however quite general and should\nfind application to a larger variety of problems requiring a few dominant\neigenvalues of a matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 2008 21:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Due to\nthe inter-dot coupling of $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals in these QD arrays, two\ndimensional conduction bands can be formed in the x-y plane, while the $p_z$\norbitals remain localized in the x-y plane such that the inter-dot coupling\nbetween them can be neglected. We model such systems by taking into account the\non-site repulsive interactions between electrons in $p_z$ orbitals and the\ncoupling of the localized $p_z$ orbitals with the 2D conduction bands formed by\n$p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals. The Green's function method within an extended\nAnderson model is used to calculate the tunneling current through the QDs. We\nfind that bistable tunneling current can exist for such systems due to the\ninterplay of the on-site Coulomb interactions (U) between the $p_z$ orbitals\nand the delocalized nature of conduction band states derived from the\nhybridization of $p_x$ / $p_y$ orbitals. This bistable current is not sensitive\nto the detailed band structure of the two dimensional band, but depends\ncritically on the strength of $U$ and the ratio of the left and right tunneling\nrates. The behavior of the electrical bistability can be sustained when the 2D\nQD array reduces to a one-dimensional QD array, indicating the feasibility for\nhigh-density packing of these bistable nanoscale structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2008 01:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The twisted magnetosphere\ndoes not remain static and gradually untwists, dissipating magnetic energy and\nproducing radiation. The equation describing this evolution is derived, and its\nsolutions are presented. Two distinct regions coexist in untwisting\nmagnetospheres: a potential region where curl(B)=0 (\"cavity\") and a\ncurrent-carrying bundle of field lines (\"j-bundle\"). The cavity has a sharp\nboundary, which expands with time and eventually erases all of the twist. In\nthis process, the electric current of the j-bundle is sucked into the star.\nObservational appearance of the untwisting process is discussed. A hot spot\nforms at the footprints of the j-bundle. The spot shrinks with time toward the\nmagnetic dipole axis, and its luminosity and temperature gradually decrease. As\nthe j-bundle shrinks, the amplitude of its twist can grow to the maximum\npossible value ~ 1. The strong twist near the dipole axis increases the\nspindown rate of the star and can generate a broad beam of radio emission. The\nmodel explains the puzzling behavior of magnetar XTE J1810-197 -- a canonical\nexample of magnetospheric evolution following a starquake. We also discuss\nimplications for other magnetars.

There are two sources, VLA 1 (=IRAS\n05491+0247) and VLA 2, with the VLA 1 source driving the HH 111 jet. Thermal\nemission is seen in 1.33 mm continuum tracing the dust in the envelope and the\nputative disks around the sources. A flattened, torus-like envelope is seen in\nC18O and 13CO around the VLA 1 source surrounding the dust lane perpendicular\nto the jet axis, with an inner radius of ~ 400 AU (1\"), an outer radius of ~\n3200 AU (8\"), and a thickness of ~ 1000 AU (2.5\"). It seems to be infalling\ntoward the center with conservation of specific angular momentum rather than\nwith a Keplerian rotation as assumed by Yang et al. 1997. An inner envelope is\nseen in SO, with a radius of ~ 500 AU (1.3\"). The inner part of this inner\nenvelope, which is spatially coincident with the dust lane, seems to have a\ndifferential rotation and thus may have formed a rotationally supported disk.\nThe outer part of this inner envelope, however, may have a rotation velocity\ndecreasing toward the center and thus represent a region where an infalling\nenvelope is in transition to a rotationally supported disk. A brief comparison\nwith a collapsing model suggests that the flattened, torus-like envelope seen\nin C18O and 13CO could result from a collapse of a magnetized rotating toroid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2008 07:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

They do not\nalways agree with optical spectroscopic ages. Adding optical data sometimes\nleads to the rejection of the solar neighbourhood extinction law.

Energy required to advance fracture is\nalso larger in some disordered systems, which indicates that the fracture\ntoughness improves. The increase of the energy is caused by the following two\nfactors. One is that the soft spring is able to hold larger energy than the\nhard one. The other is that the number of cut springs increases as the fracture\nsurface becomes tortuous in disordered systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2008 12:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Networks exhibit a long list of\nsurprising properties: heavy tails for the degree distribution; small\ndiameters; and densification and shrinking diameters over time. Most present\nnetwork models either fail to match several of the above properties, are\ncomplicated to analyze mathematically, or both. In this paper we propose a\ngenerative model for networks that is both mathematically tractable and can\ngenerate networks that have the above mentioned properties. Our main idea is to\nuse the Kronecker product to generate graphs that we refer to as \"Kronecker\ngraphs\".\n  First, we prove that Kronecker graphs naturally obey common network\nproperties. We also provide empirical evidence showing that Kronecker graphs\ncan effectively model the structure of real networks.\n  We then present KronFit, a fast and scalable algorithm for fitting the\nKronecker graph generation model to large real networks. A naive approach to\nfitting would take super- exponential time. In contrast, KronFit takes linear\ntime, by exploiting the structure of Kronecker matrix multiplication and by\nusing statistical simulation techniques.\n  Experiments on large real and synthetic networks show that KronFit finds\naccurate parameters that indeed very well mimic the properties of target\nnetworks. Once fitted, the model parameters can be used to gain insights about\nthe network structure, and the resulting synthetic graphs can be used for null-\nmodels, anonymization, extrapolations, and graph summarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2008 13:22:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 21:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-22"}

The total intensity traces the strength and distribution of total\nmagnetic fields. Total fields in gas-rich spiral arms and bars of nearby\ngalaxies have strengths of 20-30 $\\mu$Gauss, due to the amplification of\nturbulent fields, and are dynamically important. In the Milky Way, the total\nfield strength is about 6 $\\mu$G near the Sun and several 100 $\\mu$G in\nfilaments near the Galactic Center. -- The polarized intensity measures ordered\nfields with a preferred orientation, which can be regular or anisotropic\nfields. Ordered fields with spiral structure exist in grand-design, barred,\nflocculent and even in irregular galaxies. The strongest ordered fields are\nfound in interarm regions, sometimes forming \"magnetic spiral arms\" between the\noptical arms. Halo fields are X-shaped, probably due to outflows. -- The\nFaraday rotation of the polarization vectors traces coherent regular fields\nwhich have a preferred direction.

We\nrecall the explicit forms, found in previous work, of these Fuchsian equations.\nThese differential operators are very selected Fuchsian linear differential\noperators, and their remarkable properties have a deep geometrical origin: they\nare all globally nilpotent, or, sometimes, even have zero p-curvature.

For b<0 rotating\nblack holes with dimensionless spin a>1 are allowed. We investigate the role of\nthe tidal charge b in the orbital resonance model of QPOs in black hole\nsystems. The orbital Keplerian, the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies\nof the equatorial, quasicircular geodetical motion are given and their radial\nprofiles are discussed. The resonant conditions are given in three\nastrophysically relevant situations: for direct (parametric) resonances, for\nthe relativistic precession model, and for some trapped oscillations of the\nwarped discs, with resonant combinational frequencies. It is shown, how b could\ninfluence matching of the observational data indicating the 3:2 frequency ratio\nobserved in GRS 1915+105 microquasar with prediction of the orbital resonance\nmodel; limits on allowed range of the black hole parameters a and b are\nestablished. The \"magic\" dimensionless black hole spin enabling presence of\nstrong resonant phenomena at the radius where \\nu_K:\\nu_{\\theta}:\\nu_r=3:2:1 is\ndetermined in dependence on b. Such strong resonances could be relevant even in\nsources with highly scattered resonant frequencies, as those expected in Sgr\nA*.
