In\nparticular, these stars allow us to study the formation and evolution of the\nelements and the involved nucleosynthesis processes. Metal-poor stars are the\nlocal equivalent of the high-redshift Universe, and thus offer crucial\nobservational constraints on a variety of issues regarding the early Universe.\nThis review presents an introduction to metal-poor stars and their role as\n\"cosmic lab\" for the study of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis processes,\nparticularly that of the r-process. The metal-poor star HE 1523-0901 serves as\nan example for this group of objects. It displays in its spectrum the strongest\noverabundance of neutron-capture elements associated with the r-process. Heavy\nneutron-capture elements such as Eu, Os, and Ir were measured, as well as the\nradioactive elements Th and U. Abundance of Th and U, in conjunction with those\nof stable elements make possible nucleo-chronomtery, i.e., the determination of\nstellar ages. HE 1523-0901 appears to be ~13 Gyr old. Age uncertaintites range\nfrom 2-5 Gyr for individual chronometers, and are largly due to theoretical\nuncertainties in the initial production ratio of the employed chronometers. The\ndecay product of the radioactive elements, lead, can be used to constrain\nr-process calculations. Only few such stars are currently known with detected\nU. These objects, however, are crucial for the study of this nucleosynthesis\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2008 17:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-14"}

It is therefore\ncrucial to check whether its semiclassical limit coincides with the classical\nvolume operator plus quantum corrections. In the present article we investigate\nthis question by generalizing and employing previously defined coherent states\nfor LQG which derive from a cylindrically consistently defined complexifier\noperator which is the quantization of a known classical function. These\ncoherent states are not normalizable due to the non separability of the LQG\nHilbert space but they define uniquely define cut off states depending on a\nfinite graph. The result of our analysis is that the expectation value of the\nvolume operator with respect to coherent states depending on a graph with only\nn valent verticies reproduces its classical value at the phase space point at\nwhich the coherent state is peaked only if n = 6. In other words, the\nsemiclassical sector of LQG defined by those states is described by graphs with\ncubic topology!

Here, we uncover the constitutive relation of\ngraphene and probe new physics of its optical phonons, by studying its Raman\nspectrum as a function of uniaxial strain. We find that the doubly degenerate\nE2g optical mode splits in two components, one polarized along the strain and\nthe other perpendicular to it. This leads to the splitting of the G peak into\ntwo bands, which we call G+ and G-, by analogy with the effect of curvature on\nthe nanotube G peak[5-7]. Both peaks red shift with increasing strain, and\ntheir splitting increases, in excellent agreement with first-principles\ncalculations. Their relative intensities are found to depend on light\npolarization, which provides a useful tool to probe the graphene\ncrystallographic orientation with respect to the strain.

We then compute dynamical friction timescales for\nthe double quasar systems to investigate their frequency and their agreement\nwith scenarios for quasar triggering. Comparing typical merging timescales to\nexpected quasar lifetimes, the fraction of double quasars should be roughly a\nfactor of 10 larger than observed.

This\nallows to confirm that short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations can mediate\nsuperconductivity with d-wave symmetry. Ladders are also nice prototype systems\nallowing to demonstrate the truncation of the Fermi surface and the emergence\nof a Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) state with preformed pairs in the vicinity\nof the Mott state. In two dimensions, a similar scenario emerges from\nrenormalization group arguments.

This is mainly due to the violent relaxation\nand the angular momentum loss experienced by the host galaxy during the merger\nprocess, which is caused by the adopted orbital parameters. This result\nsuggests that the building of the Hubble sequence is significantly influenced\nby the last major collision. In the present case, the merger leads to a severe\ndamage of the disk of the progenitor, leading to an evolution towards a more\nbulge dominated galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2008 23:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Methods: H.E.S.S., an array of four Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov\nTelescopes (IACT), is used to observe the targets in the range of VHE gamma\nrays. Results: No significant gamma-ray signal is found at the respective\nposition of the two clusters with several different source size assumptions for\neach target. In particular, emission regions corresponding to the high density\ncore, to the extension of the entire X-ray emission in these clusters, and to\nthe very extended region where the accretion shock is expected, are\ninvestigated. Upper limits are derived for the gamma-ray flux at energies E>570\nGeV for Abell 496 and E>460 GeV for Abell 85. Conclusions: From the\nnon-detection in VHE gamma rays, upper limits on the total energy of hadronic\nCRs in the clusters are calculated. If the cosmic-ray energy density follows\nthe large scale gas density profile, the limit on the fraction of energy in\nthese non-thermal particles with respect to the total thermal energy of the\nintra-cluster medium (ICM) is 51% for Abell 496 and only 8% for Abell 85 due to\nits larger mass and higher gas density.

However, the\nopposite holds for the slow wind, and the overall particle contribution $L_P =\nL_p + L_\\alpha$ tends to exceed the magnetic one $L_M$. These aspects are at\nvariance with previous models. We examine whether introducing realistic ion\ntemperature anisotropies can resolve this discrepancy. From the general\nmultifluid transport equations with gyrotropic species pressure tensors, we\nderive the equations governing both the meridional and azimuthal dynamics of\ngeneral axisymmetrical, rotating stellar winds that include two major ion\nspecies. The azimuthal dynamics are examined in detail, using the empirically\nconstructed meridional flow profiles for the solar wind. We find that $L$ is\ndetermined by requiring that the solution to the total angular momentum\nconservation law is unique and smooth close to the Alfven point, where the\ncombined Alfvenic Mach number $M_T=1$. Introducing realistic ion temperature\nanisotropies may introduce a change of up to 10% in $L$ and up to 1.8 km/s in\nazimuthal speeds of individual ions between 0.3 and 1 AU, compared with the\nisotropic case. The latter has strong consequences on the relative importance\nof $L_P$ and $L_M$. However, introducing ion temperature anisotropies cannot\nresolve the discrepancy between measurements and models. For the fast-wind\nsolutions, while in extreme cases $L_P$ becomes negative, $L_p$ never does.

First, the contribution of the cosmological matter fluid to the\nconserved quantities is carefully studied and proved to be vanishing. Second,\nwe explicitly show that our superpotential (that happens to coincide with the\nso-called KBL potential although it is generated differently) provides strong\nconservation laws under much weaker hypotheses than the ones usually required.\nIn particular, the symmetry generator is not needed to be Killing (nor Killing\nof the background, nor asymptotically Killing), the prescription is quasi-local\nand it works fine in a finite region too and no matching condition on the\nboundary is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2008 12:29:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 13:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-11"}

For finite\nsystems, each stationary point is found to cause a nonanalyticity in the\nmicrocanonical entropy, and the functional form of this nonanalytic term can be\nderived explicitly. With increasing system size, the order of the nonanalytic\nterm grows unboundedly, leading to an increasing differentiability of the\nentropy. Therefore, in the thermodynamic limit, only asymptotically flat\nstationary points may cause a phase transition to take place. For several spin\nmodels, these results are illustrated by predicting the absence or presence of\na phase transition from stationary points and their local curvatures in\nmicroscopic configuration space. These results establish a relationship between\nproperties of energy landscapes and the occurrence of phase transitions. Such\nan approach appears particularly promising for the simultaneous study of\ndynamical and thermodynamical properties, as is of interest for example for\nprotein folding or the glass transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2008 13:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-24"}
