The halo models are constructed with\nvarious asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cusps to core-like\nprofiles and we employ the phase-space density estimator ``Enbid'' developed by\nSharma & Steinmetz to compute f(x,v). The adopted force resolution allows\nrobust phase-space density profile estimates in the inner ~1% of the virial\nradii of the simulated systems. We confirm that mergers result in a decrease of\nthe coarse-grained phase-space density in accordance with expectations from\nMixing Theorems for collisionless systems. We demonstrate that binary mergers\nbetween identical DM halos produce remnants that retain excellent memories of\nthe inner slopes and overall shapes of the phase-space density distribution of\ntheir progenitors. The robustness of the phase-space density profiles holds for\na range of orbital energies, and a variety of encounter configurations\nincluding sequences of several consecutive merger events, designed to mimic\nhierarchical merging, and collisions occurring at different cosmological\nepochs. If the progenitor halos are constructed with appreciably different\nasymptotic power-law indices, we find that the inner slope and overall shape of\nthe phase-space density distribution of the remnant are substantially closer to\nthat of the initial system with the steepest central density cusp. These\nresults explicitly demonstrate that mixing is incomplete in equal-mass mergers\nbetween DM halos, as it does not erase memory of the progenitor properties. Our\nresults also confirm the recent analytical predictions of Dehnen (2005)\nregarding the preservation of merging self-gravitating central density cusps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2008 20:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2009 23:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

This complicates finding the relation\nbetween brane properties and the bulk geometries they source. (These\ncomplications do not arise for codimension-1 sources, such as in RS geometries,\nbecause of the special properties unique to codimension one.) Understanding\nthese relations is a prerequisite for phenomenological applications involving\nhigher-codimension branes. Using codimension-2 branes in extra-dimensional\nscalar-tensor theories as an example, we identify the classical matching\nconditions that relate the near-brane asymptotic behaviour of bulk fields to\nthe low-energy effective actions describing how space-filling codimension-2\nbranes interact with the surrounding extra-dimensional bulk. We do so by\ncarefully regulating the near-brane divergences, and show how these may be\nrenormalized in a general way. Among the interesting consequences is a\nconstraint relating the on-brane curvature to its action, that is the\ncodimension-2 generalization of the well-known modification of the Friedmann\nequation for codimension-1 branes. We argue that its interpretation within an\neffective field theory framework in this case is as a relation $4\\pi U \\simeq\n\\kappa^2 (T')^2$ between the codimension-2 brane tension, T, and its\ncontribution to the low-energy on-brane effective potential, U.

We compare and contrast the relative merits\nof each code using ~13000 spectroscopic redshifts from the 2SLAQ sample. We\nfind that the performance of each code depends on the figure of merit used to\nassess it. As expected, the availability of a complete training set means that\nthe training method performs best in the intermediate redshift bins where there\nare plenty of training objects. Codes such as Le PHARE, which use new observed\ntemplates perform best in the lower redshift bins.

Quantum ensembles are necessary to\ndescribe situations with incomplete a priori information, such as the output of\na stochastic quantum channel (generalized measurement), and play a central role\nin quantum communication. In this paper, we propose measures of distance and\nfidelity between two quantum ensembles. We consider two approaches: the first\none is based on the ability to mimic one ensemble given the other one as a\nresource and is closely related to the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transportation\nproblem, while the second one uses the idea of extended-Hilbert-space (EHS)\nrepresentations which introduce auxiliary pointer (or flag) states. Both types\nof measures enjoy a number of desirable properties. The Kantorovich measures,\nalbeit monotonic under deterministic quantum operations, are not monotonic\nunder generalized measurements. In contrast, the EHS measures are. We present\noperational interpretations for both types of measures. We also show that the\nEHS fidelity between ensembles provides a novel interpretation of the fidelity\nbetween mixed states--the latter is equal to the maximum of the fidelity\nbetween all pure-state ensembles whose averages are equal to the mixed states\nbeing compared. We finally use the new measures to define distance and fidelity\nfor stochastic quantum channels and positive operator-valued measures (POVMs).\nThese quantities may be useful in the context of tomography of stochastic\nquantum channels and quantum detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2008 16:46:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Dec 2008 00:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2009 14:31:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2009 21:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-30"}

We aim to determine the mechanisms of cm emission\nfor 3 T Tauri stars. WW Cha and RU Lup were recently found to have grain growth\nat least up to mm sizes in their circumstellar disks. CS Cha has similar\nindications for grain growth in its circumbinary disk. The T Tauri stars WW Cha\nand RU Lup were monitored over several years at mm and cm wavelengths, using\nATCA. The new ATCA 7 mm system was also used to observe CS Cha. WW Cha was\ndetected on several occasions at 7 and 16 mm. We obtained one detection of WW\nCha at 3 cm and upper limits only at 6 cm. The emission at 16 mm was stable\nover days, months and years, but the emission at 3 cm is found to be variable.\nRU Lup was detected at 7 mm. It was observed at 16 mm 3 times and at 3 and 6 cm\n4 times and found to be variable in all 3 wavebands. CS Cha was detected at 7\nmm, but the S/N was too low to resolve the gap in the circumbinary disk. The\nemission at 3, 7 and 16 mm for WW Cha is well explained by thermal emission\nfrom mm and cm-sized pebbles. The cm spectral index is consistent with the\nemission from an optically-thick ionised wind, but the high variability of the\ncm emission points to a non-thermal contribution. The SEDs of RU Lup and CS Cha\nfrom 1 to 7 mm are consistent with thermal emission from mm-sized grains. The\nvariability of the longer-wavelength emission for RU Lup and the negative\nspectral index suggest non-thermal emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2008 17:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This network consists\nof a binary genetic switch in which stochastic flipping between the two switch\nstates is mediated by a \"flipping\" enzyme. Feedback between the switch state\nand the flipping rate is provided by a linear feedback mechanism: the flipping\nenzyme is only produced in the on switch state and the switching rate depends\nlinearly on the copy number of the enzyme. This work generalises the model of\n[Phys. Rev.

For this general\ncase we also solve for the flip time distribution, making a connection to first\npassage and persistence problems in statistical physics. We show that the\nstatistics of the model are non-Poissonian, leading to a peak in the flip time\ndistribution. The occurrence of such a peak is analysed as a function of the\nparameter space.

We also introduce a new\ncorrelation measure to show that this model can exhibit long-lived temporal\ncorrelations, thus providing a primitive form of cellular memory.

The analysis of the HI data shows a region of low\nemissivity that has an excellent morphological correlation with the radio\ncontinuum emission. The HII region is partially bordered by a photodissociation\nregion, which, in turn, is encircled by a molecular structure. Taking into\naccount the presence of noncircular motions in the Perseus spiral arm, together\nwith previous distance estimates for the region, we adopt a distance of 2.5 +-\n0.5 kpc for Sh2-173. Seven hot stars were identified in the field of Sh2-173,\nbeing only one an O-type star. The amount of energetic photons emitted by this\nstar is enough to keep the region ionized and heat the dust. Given that an\nexpanding HII region may trigger star formation, a search for YSO candidates\nwas made using different infrared point source catalogues.

The possibility\nfor Sh2-173 of being part of a hierarchical system of three generations is\nsuggested. The ages of both, the HII region and the large shell, were estimated\nand compared.

However, it also requires the specification of a decorrelation time\nscale of the velocity gradient along the Lagrangian evolution, and when the\nlatter is chosen too short (or, equivalently, the Reynolds number is too high),\nthe model leads to unphysical statistics. In the present paper, we explore the\nlimitations of this closure by means of numerical experiments and analytical\nconsiderations.

CRs are supplied in\nrandomly distributed supernova (SN) remnants and are described by the\ndiffusion-advection equation, which incorporates an anisotropic diffusion\ntensor. The azimuthal magnetic flux and total magnetic energy are amplified\ndepending on a particular choice of model parameters. We find that the most\nfavorable conditions for magnetic field amplification correspond to magnetic\ndiffusivity of the order of $3\\times 10^{25} \\cm^2\\s^{-1}$, SN rates close to\nthose observed in the Milky Way, periodic SN activity corresponding to spiral\narms, and highly anisotropic and field-aligned CR diffusion. The rate of\nmagnetic field amplification is relatively insensitive to the magnitude of SN\nrates in a rage of spanning 10% up to 100% of realistic values. The timescale\nof magnetic field amplification in the most favorable conditions is 150 Myr, at\ngalactocentric radius equal to 5 kpc. The final magnetic field energies\nfluctuate near equipartition with the gas kinetic energy. In all models CR\nenergy exceeds the equipartition values by a least an order of magnitude, in\ncontrary to the expected equipartition.

Further, inward transport of solids from the outer regions\nof the solar nebula has been postulated to be the manner in which short-lived\nradionuclides were introduced to the terrestrial planet region and the cause of\nthe variations in oxygen isotope ratios seen in primitive materials. Here, both\noutward and inward transport of solids are investigated in the context of a\ntwo-dimensional, viscously evolving protoplanetary disk. The dynamics of solids\nare investigated to determine how they depend on particle size and the\nparticular stage of protoplanetary disk evolution, corresponding to different\nrates of mass transport. It is found that the outward flows that arise around\nthe disk midplane of a protoplanetary disk aid in the outward transport of\nsolids up to the size of CAIs and can increase the crystallinity fraction of\nsilicate dust at 10 AU around a solar mass star to as much as $\\sim$40% in the\ncase of rapidly evolving disks, decreasing as the accretion rate onto the star\nslows. High velocity, inward flows along the disk surface aid in the rapid\ntransport of solids from the outer disk to the inner disk, particularly for\nsmall dust.

At the fundamental quantum\nmechanical level, such photometric time stamps allow which-path knowledge,\nremoving the ability to obtain an interference pattern. However, if the two\npaths can be made equal (zero time delay) then interference can occur.

Vulcanization theory studies semi-microscopic models\nof random-solid-forming systems, and applies replica field theory to deal with\ntheir quenched disorder and thermal fluctuations.

For such luminosities, up to 20% of high-redshift\nblack holes can be active quasars.

The latter\ninvolves point-like brane defects (D-particles), which provide the\ntopologically non-trivial foamy structures of space-time. A stochastic Langevin\nequation for the velocity recoil of D-particles can be derived from the pinched\napproximation for a sum over genera in the calculation of the partition\nfunction of a bosonic string in the presence of heavy D-particles. The string\ncoupling in standard perturbation theory is related to the exponential of the\nexpectation of the dilaton. Inclusion of fluctuations of the dilaton itself and\nuncertainties in the string background will then necessitate fluctuations in\n$g_{s}$. The fluctuation in the string coupling in the sum over genera\ntypically leads to a generic structure of the Langevin equation where the\ncoefficient of the noise term, dependent on the string coupling $g_{s}$,\nfluctuates. The positivity of $g_{s}$ leads naturally to a stochastic modelling\nof its distribution with a $\\chi$- distribution. This then rigorously implies a\nTsallis type non-extensive or, more generally, a superstatistics distribution\nfor the recoil velocity of D-particles. As a concrete and physically\ninteresting application, we provide a rigorous estimate of an $\\omega$-like\neffect, pertinent to CPT violating modifications of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\ncorrelators in entangled states of neutral Kaons.

This instability is related\nto the appearance of ergoregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Dec 2008 14:32:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 06:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

By using the analogy\nbetween vorticial superflow and Ampere-Maxwell magnetostatics, the equilibrium\nsuperflow containing any specified collection of vortices is constructed. The\nenergy of the superflow is found to take on a simple form for vortices that are\nsmooth and asymptotically large, compared with the vortex core size. The motion\nof vortices is analyzed in general, as well as for the special cases of\nhyper-spherical and weakly distorted hyper-planar vortices. In all dimensions,\nvortex motion reflects vortex geometry. In dimension four and higher, this\nincludes not only extrinsic but also intrinsic aspects of the vortex shape,\nwhich enter via the first and second fundamental forms of classical geometry.\nFor hyper-spherical vortices, which generalize the vortex rings of three\ndimensional superfluidity, the energy-momentum relation is determined. Simple\nscaling arguments recover the essential features of these results, up to\nnumerical and logarithmic factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Dec 2008 14:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Using translation model,\nwe prove that every function in the class CI can be realized as a transfer\nfunction of a certain vessel.\n  The highlight of this theory is a generalization Potapov's theorem, which\ngives a very special formula for such a function in the form of multiplication\nof Blacke-Potapov products, corresponding to the discrete spectrum of certain\nsystem operator $A_1(t_2)$ and of multiplicative integral, corresponding to the\ncontinuous spectrum of $A_1(t_2)$.

However, according to R\\'ev\\'esz (1977), his estimator has\ntwo main drawbacks: on the one hand, its convergence rate is smaller than that\nof the nonrecursive Nadaraya-Watson's kernel regression estimator, and, on the\nother hand, the required assumptions on the density of the random variable $X$\nare stronger than those usually needed in the framework of regression\nestimation. We first come back on the study of the convergence rate of\nR\\'ev\\'esz's estimator. An approach in the proofs completely different from\nthat used in R\\'ev\\'esz (1977) allows us to show that R\\'ev\\'esz's recursive\nestimator may reach the same optimal convergence rate as Nadaraya-Watson's\nestimator, but the required assumptions on the density of $X$ remain stronger\nthan the usual ones, and this is inherent to the definition of R\\'ev\\'esz's\nestimator. To overcome this drawback, we introduce the averaging principle of\nstochastic approximation algorithms to construct the averaged R\\'ev\\'esz's\nregression estimator, and give its asymptotic behaviour. Our assumptions on the\ndensity of $X$ are then usual in the framework of regression estimation. We\nprove that the averaged R\\'ev\\'esz's regression estimator may reach the same\noptimal convergence rate as Nadaraya-Watson's estimator. Moreover, we show\nthat, according to the estimation by confidence intervals point of view, it is\nbetter to use the averaged R\\'ev\\'esz's estimator rather than Nadaraya-Watson's\nestimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Dec 2008 15:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-23"}
