Methods: We\nuse the test field method together with 3D numerical simulations of turbulent\nconvection with shear and rotation to compute turbulent transport coefficients\ndescribing the evolution of large-scale magnetic fields in mean-field theory in\nthe kinematic regime. 1D mean-field models are used with the derived turbulent\ntransport coefficients to compare with direct simulations. Results: The\nalpha-effect increases monotonically as rotation increases. Turbulent\ndiffusivity, eta_t, is proportional to the square of the turbulent vertical\nvelocity. Whereas eta_t decreases approximately inversely proportional to the\nwavenumber of the field, the alpha-effect and turbulent pumping show a more\ncomplex behaviour. In the presence of shear and no rotation a small\nalpha-effect is induced which does not seem to show any consistent trend as a\nfunction of shear. If the shear is large enough, this small alpha is able to\nexcite a dynamo in the mean-field model. The coefficient responsible for\ndriving the shear-current effect shows several sign changes as a function of\ndepth but is also able to contribute to dynamo action in the mean-field model.\nThe growth rates in these cases are well below those in direct simulations\nsuggesting that an incoherent alpha-shear dynamo may also act in them. If both\nrotation and shear are present, the alpha-effect is more pronounced. The\ncombination of the shear-current and Omega x J-effects is also stronger than in\nthe case of shear only, but subdominant to the alpha-shear dynamo. The results\nof direct simulations are consistent with mean-field models where all of these\neffects are taken into account without the need to invoke incoherent effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 20:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 10:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-29"}

The masses and mixings of all Standard Model (SM) charged\nfermions other than top arise from higher dimensional operators involving a\nmessenger scalar S and flavon scalars F_i. The flavons spontaneously break SM\nflavor symmetries at around the TeV scale. The SM singlet scalar S couples\ndirectly to the Higgs H and spontaneously breaks another U(1) at the\nelectroweak scale. At the TeV scale, SM quarks and charged leptons have\nrenormalizable couplings to S, but not to H or F_i. These couplings involve new\nheavy vectorlike fermions. Integrating out these fermions produces a pattern of\nhigher dimensional operators that reproduce the observed hierarchies of the SM\nmasses and mixings in terms of powers of the \"little hierarchy\": the ratio of\nthe electroweak scale to the flavor-breaking scale.\n  The framework has important phenomenological implications. Flavor-changing\nneutral currents are within experimental limits but D^0 mixing and B_s->mu+mu-\ncould be close to current sensitivities. The neutral scalar s of the messenger\nfield mixes with the light Higgs of the SM, which can have strong effects on\nHiggs decay branching fractions. The s mass eigenstate may be lighter than the\nHiggs, and could be detected at the Tevatron or the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 19:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-21"}

The random potential causes\nthe inflaton to undergo a Brownian motion with a drift in the D-dimensional\nfield space. To quantify such an effect, we employ a stochastic approach to\nevaluate the two-point and three-point functions of primordial perturbations.\nWe find that in the weakly random scenario the resulting power spectrum\nresembles that of the single field slow-roll case, with up to 2% more red tilt.\nThe strongly random scenario, leads to rich phenomenologies, such as primordial\nfluctuations in the power spectrum on all angular scales.

The tensor power spectrum itself is free of fluctuations and the tensor\nto scalar ratio is enhanced. In addition a large negative running of the power\nspectral index is possible.

Very neutron rich\ndeformed nuclei may not be as good candidates as stable spherical nuclei like\n$^{132}$Sn for the experimental study of low-lying E1 strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 16:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-11"}

Here we look at interferometric visibilities as a function of\nspatial scales normalized by the size of the inner torus radius R_in. This\napproximately eliminates luminosity and distance dependence and, thus, provides\na way to uniformly view the visibilities observed for various objects and at\ndifferent wavelengths.

We present the results from a comprehensive spectroscopic survey of the\nWINGS (WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey) clusters, a program called\nWINGS-SPE.

Methods. Using\nmulti object fiber fed spectrographs, we observed our sample of WINGS cluster\ngalaxies at an intermediate resolu- tion of 6-9 A and, using a\ncross-correlation technique, we measured redshifts with a mean accuracy of\nabout 45 km/s.

Modeling the SED from UV to far-IR shows that\nmoderate dust reddening (A_V=1.3-3.2) can explain the red optical and near-IR\ncolours of the sources in the sample. There is also evidence that red QSOs have\n60/12micron luminosity ratio higher than PG QSOs (97% significance). This can\nbe interpreted as a higher level of star-formation in these systems (measured\nby the 60micron luminosity) for a given AGN power (approximated by the 12micron\nluminosity). This is consistent with a picture where red QSOs represent an\nearly phase of AGN evolution, when the supermassive black hole is enshrouded in\ndust and gas clouds, which will eventually be blown out (possibly by AGN driven\noutflows) and the system will appear as typical optically luminous QSO. There\nis also tentative evidence significant at the 96% level that red 2MASS QSOs are\nmore often associated with radio emission than optically selected SDSS QSOs.\nThis may indicate outflows, also consistent with the young AGN interpretation.\nWe also estimate the space density of red QSOs relative to optically selected\nSDSS QSOs, taking into account the effect of dust extinction and the intrinsic\nluminosity of the sources. We estimate that the fraction of red QSOs in the\noverall population increases from 3% at M_K=-27.5mag to 12% at M_K=-29.5mag.\nThis suggests that reddened QSOs become more important at the bright end of the\nLuminosity Function.

Since the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells is dependent\non the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of\npromoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration which\nis difficult to quantify directly. Here we develop a simple physical model\ndescribing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs\ntranscribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs non-specifically bound to\nDNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for E. coli\nallow us to determine the two unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce\nthe free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to\npredict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive\n(unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate dependent\nregulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in\ntranscription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth\nrates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene\nexpression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP\nexpression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the\ncase of the stringent response following amino acid starvation, we can evaluate\nthe plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control\nproposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and\nbiosynthetic operons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2008 00:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-12"}

The experimentally\nobserved capacitance of such film nanocapacitors is, however, an order of\nmagnitude lower than expected. This dramatic drop in capacitance is attributed\nto the so called dead layer - a low-permittivity layer at the metal-dielectric\ninterface in series with the high-permittivity dielectric. The exact nature of\nthe dead layer and the reasons for its origin still remain somewhat unclear.\nBased on insights gained from recently published ab initio work on\nSrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 and our first principle simulations on Au/MgO/Au and\nPt/MgO/Pt nanocapacitors, we construct an analytical model that isolates the\ncontributions of various physical mechanisms to the intrinsic dead layer.

The characteristic\nscale is $1\\sim 3$ times the cluster virial radius depending on galaxy\nluminosity. Existence of the characteristic scale means that the local galaxy\nnumber density is not directly responsible for the morphology-density relation\nin clusters because the local density varies smoothly with the clustercentric\nradius and has no discontinuity in general. What is really working in clusters\nis the morphology-clustercentric radius-neighbor environment relation, where\nthe neighbor environment means both neighbor morphology and the local mass\ndensity attributed to the neighbor. The morphology-density relation appears\nworking only because of the statistical correlation between the nearest\nneighbor distance and the local galaxy number density.

The companion is inferred to be a low-mass dwarf star in a close orbit\naround RS Gru. We found multiperiodicity in RY Lep both from photometric and\nradial velocity data and detected orbital motion in the radial velocities with\nhints of a possible period of 500--700 days. The data also revealed that the\namplitude of the secondary frequency is variable on the time-scale of a few\nyears, whereas the dominant mode is stable. Radial velocities of AD CMi\nrevealed cycle-to-cycle variations which might be due to non-radial pulsations.\nWe confirmed the multiperiodic nature of BQ Ind, while we obtained the first\nradial velocity curves of ZZ Mic and BE Lyn.

The challenge is to construct an action which preserves enough\nsymmetries to be useful in lattice gauge calculations.

To obtain useful constraints, the number of\nparameters should be smaller than the number of neutron-star properties that\nhave been measured or will have been measured in the next several years. And\nthe set must be large enough to accurately approximate the large set of\ncandidate EOSs. We find that a parameterized EOS based on piecewise polytropes\nwith 3 free parameters matches to about 4% rms error an extensive set of\ncandidate EOSs at densities below the central density of 1.4 solar mass stars.\nAdding observations of more massive stars constrains the higher density part of\nthe EOS and requires an additional parameter.

In particular, we emphasize potentially stringent\nconstraints on the EOS parameter space associated with two measured properties\nof a single star; and we find that a measurement of the moment of inertia of\nPSR J0737-3039A can strongly constrain the maximum neutron-star mass.
