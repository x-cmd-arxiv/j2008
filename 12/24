In the context of simple benchmark\nmodels for estimating the e+e- output, we consider all known pulsars, as listed\nin the most complete available catalogue. We find that it is unlikely that a\nsingle pulsar be responsible for both the PAMELA e+ fraction anomaly and for\nthe ATIC excess, although two single sources are in principle enough to explain\nboth experimental results. The PAMELA excess e+ likely come from a set of\nmature pulsars (age ~ 10^6 yr), with a distance of 0.8-1 kpc, or from a single,\nyounger and closer source like Geminga. The ATIC data require a larger (and\nless plausible) energy output, and favor an origin associated to powerful, more\ndistant (1-2 kpc) and younger (age ~ 10^5$ yr) pulsars. We list several\ncandidate pulsars that can individually or coherently contribute to explain the\nPAMELA and ATIC data. Although generally suppressed, we find that the\ncontribution of pulsars more distant than 1-2 kpc could contribute for the ATIC\nexcess. Finally, we stress the multi-faceted and decisive role that Fermi-LAT\nwill play in the very near future by (1) providing an exquisite measurement of\nthe e+e- flux, (2) unveiling the existence of as yet undetected pulsars, and\n(3) searching for anisotropies in the arrival direction of high-energy e+e-.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2008 22:07:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 20:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-06"}

In particular, we consider the functions $T$ which\nrepresent the probability of tending to infinity with respect to the random\ndynamics of polynomials. Under certain conditions these functions $T$ are\ncomplex analogues of the devil's staircase and Lebesgue's singular functions.\nMore precisely, we show that these functions $T$ are continuous on the Riemann\nsphere and vary only on the Julia sets of associated semigroups. Furthermore,\nby using ergodic theory and potential theory, we investigate the\nnon-differentiability and regularity of these functions. We find many phenomena\nwhich can hold in the random complex dynamics and the dynamics of semigroups of\nrational maps, but cannot hold in the usual iteration dynamics of a single\nholomorphic map. We carry out a systematic study of these phenomena and their\nmechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2008 04:29:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2009 07:03:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 00:55:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 10:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 03:14:14 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 02:24:02 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 10:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

It will serve as an\n`Event-Generator' of real neutrino interactions to estimate backgrounds and\nefficiencies in LBL$\\nu$. As such, it will provide a quantitative determination\nof the overall energy-scale of neutrino CC interactions and of hadronic\nmultiplicities for all CC and Neutral-Current (NC) event topologies. In\naddition, it will perform precise measurements of electroweak parameters, of\n(semi)exclusive processes such as quasi-elastic, resonance, $\\pi^0$ / $K^0_S$ /\n$\\Lambda$/charm-hadron production, as well as of the hadronic structure of\nnucleons and nuclei.

In a recent study of the\ndynamics of planetesimals in the quadruple star system HD98800 (Verrier & Evans\n2008), there were significant numbers of stable particles in circumbinary polar\norbits about the inner binary pair which are apparently able to evade the Kozai\ninstability. Here, we isolate this feature and investigate the dynamics through\nnumerical and analytical models. The results show that the Kozai mechanism of\nthe outer star is disrupted by a nodal libration induced by the inner binary\npair on a shorter timescale. By empirically modelling the period of the\nlibration, a criteria for determining the high inclination stability limits in\ngeneral triple systems is derived. The nodal libration feature is interesting\nand, although effecting inclination and node only, shows many parallels to the\nKozai mechanism. This raises the possibility that high inclination planets and\nasteroids may be able to survive in multistellar systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2008 12:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Also these clusters could have been formed before reionization in dwarf\ngalaxies that would later merge to build the Milky Way halo as predicted by\nLambda-CDM cosmology. However, the galactocentric metallicity gradient shown by\nthese clusters seems difficult to reconcile with the latter.
