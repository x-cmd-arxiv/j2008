Here we study the radiative\nfeedback from the first, short-lived stars using hydrodynamical simulations\nwith transient UV backgrounds (UVBs) and persistent Lyman-Werner backgrounds\n(LWBs) of varying intensity. We extend our prior work in Mesinger et al.\n(2006), by studying a more typical region whose proto-galaxies form at lower\nredshifts, z~13-20, in the epoch likely preceding the bulk of reionization. We\nconfirm our previous results that feedback in the relic HII regions resulting\nfrom such transient radiation, is itself transient. Feedback effects dwindle\naway after ~30% of the Hubble time, and the same critical specific intensity of\nJ_UV~0.1 x 10^{-21} ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr separates positive and negative feedback\nregimes. Additionally, we discover a second episode of eventual positive\nfeedback in halos which have not yet collapsed when their progenitor regions\nwere exposed to the transient UVB. This eventual positive feedback appears in\nall runs, regardless of the strength of the UVB. However, this feedback regime\nis very sensitive to the presence of Lyman-Werner radiation, and notable\neffects disappear under fairly modest background intensities of J_LW>10^{-3} x\n10^{-21} ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr. We conclude that UV radiative feedback in relic HII\nregions, although a complicated process, seems unlikely to have a major impact\non the progress of cosmological reionization, provided that present estimates\nof the lifetime and luminosity of a PopIII star are accurate. More likely is\nthat the build-up of the LWB ultimately governs the feedback strength until a\npersistent UV background can be established.

Yearly samples available from 1978 to 2005 were studied\nand evidence was found that the complementary cumulative distribution of\npersonal income for 99% of the economically less favorable population is well\nrepresented by a Gompertz curve of the form $G(x)=\\exp [\\exp (A-Bx)]$, where\n$x$ is the normalized individual income. The complementary cumulative\ndistribution of the remaining 1% richest part of the population is well\nrepresented by a Pareto power law distribution $P(x)= \\beta x^{-\\alpha}$. This\nresult means that similarly to other countries, Brazil's income distribution is\ncharacterized by a well defined two class system. The parameters $A$, $B$,\n$\\alpha$, $\\beta$ were determined by a mixture of boundary conditions,\nnormalization and fitting methods for every year in the time span of this\nstudy. Since the Gompertz curve is characteristic of growth models, its\npresence here suggests that these patterns in income distribution could be a\nconsequence of the growth dynamics of the underlying economic system. In\naddition, we found out that the percentage share of both the Gompertzian and\nParetian components relative to the total income shows an approximate cycling\npattern with periods of about 4 years and whose maximum and minimum peaks in\neach component alternate at about every 2 years.

This increased\nintensity provided an opportunity to search for redshifted neutron-capture\nlines from the surface of the neutron star. If discovered, such lines would\nconstrain the neutron star equation of state, providing the motivation of this\nsearch. The spectrometer (SPI) on board the INTEGRAL satellite observed the\ndimmer outburst and provided the data for this research. We have not detected a\nline with enough significance, with the width-dependent upper limits on the\nbroadened and redshifted neutron capture line in the range of (2 - 11) x\n10^(-4) photons cm^(-2) s^(-1). To our knowledge, these are the strongest upper\nlimits on the redshifted 2.2 MeV emission from an accreting neutron star. Our\nanalysis of the transparency of the neutron star surface for 2.2 MeV photons\nshows that photons have a small but finite chance of leaving the atmosphere\nunscattered, which diminishes the possibility of detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2008 08:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Members of the\nuncoupling protein family are involved in thermogenesis and determining the\nfunctional evolution of UCP genes is important to understand the evolution of\nthermo-regulation in vertebrates. RESULTS: Sequence similarity searches of\ngenome and scaffold data identified homologues of UCP in eutherians, teleosts\nand the first squamates uncoupling proteins. Phylogenetic analysis was used to\ncharacterize the family evolutionary history by identifying two duplications\nearly in vertebrate evolution and two losses in the avian lineage (excluding\nduplications within a species, excluding the losses due to incompletely\nsequenced taxa and excluding the losses and duplications inferred through\nmismatch of species and gene trees). Estimates of synonymous and nonsynonymous\nsubstitution rates (dN/dS) and more complex branch and site models suggest that\nthe duplication events were not associated with positive Darwinian selection\nand that the UCP is constrained by strong purifying selection except for a\nsingle site which has undergone positive Darwinian selection, demonstrating\nthat the UCP gene family must be highly conserved.

During one of the observations, the source\nvaried from a high state to a low state and back, in two other observations it\nvaried from a low state to respectively intermediate states. These transitions\nare interpreted as eclipse ingress and egresses of a compact object in a high\nmass X-ray binary system. The phase of mid eclipse is given by HJD\n2453997.476+-0.006, the eclipse half angle is 30.6+-1.2 degree. Adding\nXMM-Newton observations of [PMH2004] 47 in 2001 we determine the binary period\nto be 1.732479+-0.000027 d. This period is also consistent with ROSAT HRI\nobservations of the source in 1994. No short term periodicity compatible with a\nrotation period of the compact object is detected. There are indications for a\nlong term variability similar to that detected for Her X-1. During the high\nstate the spectrum of the source is hard (power law spectrum with photon index\n~0.85) with an unabsorbed luminosity of 2E37 erg/cm2/s (0.2-4.5 keV).

The optical light\ncurve together with the X-ray eclipse can be modeled by a compact object with a\nmass consistent with a neutron star or a black hole in a high mass X-ray\nbinary. However, the hard power law X-ray spectrum favors a neutron star as the\ncompact object in this second eclipsing X-ray binary in M 33.

In order to clarify the origin of this modulation,\nwe obtained three time-resolved $r'$-band light curves (LCs) of the source in\nfive days. The LCs can be described by a sinusoid, and the long time-span\nbetween them allows us to determine optical period P=7251.9 s and phase 0.671\nat MJD 54599.0 (TDB; phase 0.0 corresponds to the ascending node of the pulsar\norbit), with uncertainties of 2.8 s and 0.008 (90 % confidence), respectively.\nThis periodicity is highly consistent with the X-ray orbital ephemeris. By\nconsidering this consistency and the sinusoidal shape of the LCs, we rule out\nthe possibility of the modulation arising from the accretion disk. Our study\nsupports the previous suggestion that the X-ray pulsar becomes rotationally\npowered in quiescence, with its energy output irradiating the companion star,\ncausing the optical modulation.

At lower densities\nwhere the QCD coupling constant is large, perturbative methods cannot be\napplied and one has to rely on some effective model, eventually trying to\nconstrain such a model with experimental observations. The picture is\ncomplicated by the requirement that matter in the interior of compact stars is\nin weak equilibrium and neutral.

To evaluate its performance, we first\ncompare its operation with that of standard quenching electronics. We then test\n4 InGaAs/InP APDs using the ASIC, operating both in the free-running and gated\nmodes, to study more general behavior. We investigate not only the standard\nparameters under different working conditions but also parameters such as\ncharge persistence and quenching time. We also use the multiple trapping model\nto account for the afterpulsing behavior in the gated mode, and further propose\na model to take account of the afterpulsing effects in the free-running mode.\nOur results clearly indicate that the performance of APDs with an on-chip\nquenching circuit significantly surpasses the conventional quenching\nelectronics, and makes them suitable for practical applications, e.g., quantum\ncryptography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2008 15:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-02"}
