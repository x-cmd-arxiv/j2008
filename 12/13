The excess of power seen in the\nLyman-alpha forest and small-scale CMB experiments, the anomalously large bulk\nflows seen both in peculiar velocity surveys and in kinetic SZ, and the higher\nISW cross-correlation all indicate that structure may be more evolved than\nexpected from LCDM. We argue that these observations find a natural explanation\nin models with infinite-volume (or, at least, cosmological-size) extra\ndimensions, where the graviton is a resonance with a tiny width. The\nlongitudinal mode of the graviton mediates an extra scalar force which speeds\nup structure formation at late times, thereby accounting for the above\nanomalies. The required graviton Compton wavelength is relatively small\ncompared to the present Hubble radius, of order 300-600 Mpc. Moreover, with\ncertain assumptions about the behavior of the longitudinal mode on super-Hubble\nscales, our modified gravity framework can also alleviate the tension with the\nlow quadrupole and the peculiar vanishing of the CMB correlation function on\nlarge angular scales, seen both in COBE and WMAP. This relies on a novel\nmechanism that cancels a late-time ISW contribution against the primordial\nSachs-Wolfe amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 19:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 2009 00:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-23"}

Visibly pushdown automata with\nmultiple stacks have been considered recently by La Torre, Madhusudan, and\nParlato, who exploit the concept of visibility further to obtain a rich\nautomata class that can even express properties beyond the class of\ncontext-free languages. At the same time, their automata are closed under\nboolean operations, have a decidable emptiness and inclusion problem, and enjoy\na logical characterization in terms of a monadic second-order logic over words\nwith an additional nesting structure. These results require a restricted\nversion of visibly pushdown automata with multiple stacks whose behavior can be\nsplit up into a fixed number of phases. In this paper, we consider 2-stack\nvisibly pushdown automata (i.e., visibly pushdown automata with two stacks) in\ntheir unrestricted form. We show that they are expressively equivalent to the\nexistential fragment of monadic second-order logic. Furthermore, it turns out\nthat monadic second-order quantifier alternation forms an infinite hierarchy\nwrt words with multiple nestings. Combining these results, we conclude that\n2-stack visibly pushdown automata are not closed under complementation.\nFinally, we discuss the expressive power of B\\\"{u}chi 2-stack visibly pushdown\nautomata running on infinite (nested) words. Extending the logic by an infinity\nquantifier, we can likewise establish equivalence to existential monadic\nsecond-order logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 16:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2008 12:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

They are most prominent among the binaries with periods\nless than 43 days, a cutoff first identified by Lucy. Within the subsample of\nbinaries with P<43 days, the twins do not differ from the other binaries in\ntheir distributions of periods (median P~7d), masses, or orbital\neccentricities. Combining the mass ratio distribution in the SB9 in the mass\nrange 0.6 to 0.85 Msun with that measured by Mazeh et al. for binaries in the\nCarney-Latham high proper motion survey, we estimate that the frequency of\ntwins in a large sample of spectroscopic binaries is about 3%.

We speculate\nthat the excess of twins is produced in those star forming regions where the\naccretion processes were able to proceed to completion for a minority of\nprotobinaries. This predicts that the components of a young twin may appear to\ndiffer in age and that, in a sample of spectroscopic binaries in a star\nformation region, the twins are, on average, older than the binaries with mass\nratios much smaller than 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 16:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In spite of extensive\nobservational efforts, these questions remain to be answered and are difficult\nor even impossible to infer with the spectral and lightcurve information\ncurrently collected. Polarization measurements will lead to unambiguous answers\nto several of these questions. Recent developments in X-ray and gamma-ray\npolarimetry techniques have demonstrated a significant increase in sensitivity\nenabling several new mission concepts, e.g. POET (Polarimeters for Energetic\nTransients), providing wide field of view and broadband polarimetry\nmeasurements. If launched, missions of this kind would finally provide\ndefinitive measurements of GRB polarizations. We perform Monte Carlo\nsimulations to derive the distribution of GRB polarizations in three emission\nmodels; the synchrotron model with a globally ordered magnetic field (SO\nmodel), the synchrotron model with a locally random magnetic field (SR model),\nand the Compton drag model (CD model). The results show that POET, or other\npolarimeters with similar capabilities, can constrain the GRB emission models\nby using the statistical properties of GRB polarizations. In particular, the\nratio of the number of GRBs for which the polarization degrees can be measured\nto the number of GRBs that are detected (N_m/N_d) and the distributions of the\npolarization degrees (Pi) can be used as the criteria. If N_m/N_d > 30% and Pi\nis clustered between 0.2 and 0.7, the SO model will be favored. If instead\nN_m/N_d < 15%, then the SR or CD model will be favored. If several events with\nPi > 0.8 are observed, then the CD model will be favored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 21:11:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2009 18:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

While there is good observational support for forming at least\nsome giant planets by disk instability, the mechanism has become theoretically\ncontentious, with different three dimensional radiative hydrodynamics codes\noften yielding different results. Rigorous code testing is required to make\nfurther progress. Here we present two new analytical solutions for radiative\ntransfer in spherical coordinates, suitable for testing the code employed in\nall of the Boss disk instability calculations. The testing shows that the Boss\ncode radiative transfer routines do an excellent job of relaxing to and\nmaintaining the analytical results for the radial temperature and radiative\nflux profiles for a spherical cloud with high or moderate optical depths,\nincluding the transition from optically thick to optically thin regions. These\nradial test results are independent of whether the Eddington approximation,\ndiffusion approximation, or flux-limited diffusion approximation routines are\nemployed. The Boss code does an equally excellent job of relaxing to and\nmaintaining the analytical results for the vertical (theta) temperature and\nradiative flux profiles for a disk with a height proportional to the radial\ndistance. These tests strongly support the disk instability mechanism for\nforming giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 22:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We present new data from the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array HI\n(GALFA-HI) Survey that show the full extent and detailed spatial and kinematic\nstructure of M33's neutral hydrogen. Over 18% of the HI mass of M33 (M_HI(tot)\n=1.4 x 10^9 Msun) is found beyond the star forming disk as traced in the\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV). The most distinct features are extended warps, an arc\nfrom the northern warp to the disk, diffuse gas surrounding the galaxy, and a\nsouthern cloud with a filament back to the galaxy. The features extend out to\n22 kpc from the galaxy center (18 kpc from the edge of the FUV disk) and the\ngas is directly connected to M33's disk. Only five discrete clouds (i.e., gas\nnot directly connected to M33 in position-velocity space) are catalogued in the\nvicinity of M33, and these clouds show similar properties to Galactic and M31\nhalo clouds. M33's gaseous features most likely originate from the tidal\ndisruption of M33 by M31 1-3 Gyr ago as shown from an orbit analysis which\nresults in a tidal radius < 15 kpc in the majority of M33's possible orbits.\nM33 is now beyond the disruptive gravitational influence of M31 and the gas\nappears to be returning to M33's disk and redistributing its star formation\nfuel. M33's high mean velocity dispersion in the disk (~18.5 km/s) may also be\nconsistent with the previous interaction and high rate of star formation. M33\nwill either exhaust its star formation fuel in the next few Gyrs or eventually\nbecome star formation fuel for M31. The latter represents the accretion of a\nlarge gaseous satellite by a spiral galaxy, similar to the Magellanic Clouds'\nrelationship to the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 21:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2009 17:05:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 21:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
