Such a large density could result from an accumulation cascade, in\nwhich the solar system-bound dark matter density is much higher than the\ngalactic halo density, and the earth-bound density is much higher than the\nsolar system-bound density. We discuss a number of strong constraints on the\nhypothesis of a dark matter explanation for the flyby anomaly. These require\ndark matter to be non-self-annihilating, with the dark matter scattering cross\nsection on nucleons much larger, and the dark matter mass much lighter, than\nusually assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2008 16:11:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 2008 15:24:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Aug 2008 21:46:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 2008 22:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-16"}

We observed 98 and 49 low-mass (0.2-1.0 M_sun) stars in sigma Ori\nand lambda Ori respectively, using the multi-object optical spectrograph FLAMES\nat the VLT, with the high-resolution (R=17,000) HR15N grating (6470-6790 AA).\nWe used radial velocities, Li and Halpha to establish cluster membership and\nHalpha and other optical emission lines to analyze the accretion properties of\nmembers.\n  Results. We identified 65 and 45 members of the sigma Ori and lambda Ori\nclusters, respectively and discovered 16 new candidate binary systems. We also\nmeasured rotational broadening for 20 stars and estimated the mass accretion\nrates in 25 stars of the sigma Ori cluster, finding values between 10^-11 and\n10^-7.7 M_sun yr^-1 and in 4 stars of the lambda Ori cluster, finding values\nbetween 10^-11 and 10^-10.1 M_sun yr-1. Comparing our results with the infrared\nphotometry obtained by the Spitzer satellite, we find that the fraction of\nstars with disks and the fraction of active disks is larger in the sigma Ori\ncluster (52+-9% and 78+-16%) than in lambda Ori (28+-8% and 40+-20%)\n  Conclusions. The different disk and accretion properties of the two clusters\ncould be due either to the effect of the high-mass stars and the supernova\nexplosion in the lambda Ori cluster or to different ages of the cluster\npopulations. Further observations are required to draw a definitive conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2008 17:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Generalizing the results of\n[Adesso & Illuminati, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 150501 (2007)], we analyze whether\nthe entanglement shared by blocks of modes distributes according to a strong\nmonogamy law. This property, once established, allows to quantify genuine\nN-partite entanglement in terms of the \"residual contangle\" not encoded into\n2,...,K,...,(N-1)-partite quantum correlations. The explicit expression of this\nentanglement measure is derived, by a recursive formula, for a subclass of\nGaussian states. These are fully symmetric (permutation-invariant) states\nmulti-partitioned into blocks, each consisting of an arbitrary number of modes.\nWe compute the genuine multipartite entanglement shared by the blocks\n(\"molecules\") and investigate its scaling properties with the number and size\nof the molecules, the total number of modes, the global mixedness of the state,\nand the squeezed resources. To achieve the exact computation we prove a general\nresult of symplectic analysis: Correlations among K molecules in N-mode\nmulti-symmetric Gaussian states can be transformed by a local unitary operation\ninto correlations shared by K single modes, one per molecule, in effective\nnon-symmetric states. Due to this theorem, the above results extend to the\nsubclass of non-symmetric Gaussian states that are obtained by unitarily\nlocalizing the multipartite molecular entanglement of symmetric states. These\nfindings provide evidence that distributed Gaussian entanglement is strongly\nmonogamous even beyond specific symmetry constraints, and that the residual\ncontangle is a bona fide measure of genuine multipartite entanglement for\npermutation-invariant Gaussian states under any multi-partition of the modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2008 07:05:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Oct 2008 03:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-14"}

Low Luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) are contaminated by the light\nof their host galaxies, and cannot therefore be detected by the usual colour\ntechniques. For this reason, their evolution in cosmic time is poorly known.\nConsistency with the evolution derived from X-ray detected samples has not been\nclearly established so far, also because the low luminosity population consists\nof a mixture of different object types. LLAGNs can be detected by the nuclear\noptical variability of extended objects. Several variability surveys have been,\nor are being, conducted for the detection of supernovae (SNe). We propose to\nre-analyse these SNe data using a variability criterion optimised for AGN\ndetection, to select a new AGN sample and study its properties. We analysed\nimages acquired with the wide field imager at the 2.2 m ESO/MPI telescope, in\nthe framework of the STRESS supernova survey. We selected the AXAF field\ncentred on the Chandra Deep Field South where, besides the deep X-ray survey,\nvarious optical data exist, originating in the EIS and COMBO-17 photometric\nsurveys and the spectroscopic database of GOODS. We obtained a catalogue of 132\nvariable AGN candidates. Several of the candidates are X-ray sources. We\ncompare our results with an HST variability study of X-ray and IR detected\nAGNs, finding consistent results. The relatively high fraction of confirmed\nAGNs in our sample (60%) allowed us to extract a list of reliable AGN\ncandidates for spectroscopic follow-up observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2008 07:30:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 17:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We find that this object has\nextraordinarily broad [OIII]5007 and [OIII]4959 emission lines, with velocity\nwidths of approximately 2,000 k/ms. This result has significant implications\nfor the nature of this accreting black-hole system and the mass of the globular\ncluster black hole. We show that the broad [OIII]5007 emission must arise from\nmaterial driven at high velocity from the black hole system. This is because\nthe volume available near the black hole is too small by many orders of\nmagnitude to have enough [OIII] emitting atoms to account for the observed\nL([OIII]5007) at high velocities, even if this volume is filled with Oxygen at\nthe critical density for [OIII]5007. The Balmer emission is also weak,\nindicating the observed [OIII] is not due to shocks. We therefore conclude that\nthe [OIII]4959,5007 is produced by photoionization of material driven across\nthe cluster. The only known way to drive significant material at high velocity\nis for a system accreting mass near or above its Eddington limit, which\nindicates a stellar mass black hole. Since it is dynamically implausible to\nform an accreting stellar mass black hole system in a globular cluster with an\nintermediate mass black hole (IMBH), it appears this massive globular cluster\ndoes not have an IMBH.

We extend\nthe formalism of Purcell et al. (2007), in which diffuse stellar mass is\nproduced via galaxy disruption, and we convolve this result with the observed\nmass-metallicity relation for galaxies in order to analyze the chemical\nabundance of intrahalo light (IHL) in host halos with virial mass 10^10.5 M_sun\n< M_host < 10^15 M_sun. We predict a steep rise of roughly two dex in IHL\nmetallicity from the scales of small to large spiral galaxies. In terms of the\ntotal dynamical mass M_host of the host systems under consideration, we predict\ndiffuse light metallicities ranging from Z_IHL < -2.5 for M_host ~ 10^11 M_sun,\nto Z_IHL ~ -1.0 for M_host ~ 10^12 M_sun. In larger systems, we predict a\ngradual flattening of this trend with Z_IHL ~ -0.4 for M_host ~ 10^13 M_sun,\nincreasing to Z_IHL ~ 0.1 for M_host ~ 10^15 M_sun. This behavior is coincident\nwith a narrowing of the intrahalo metallicity distribution as host mass\nincreases. The observable distinction in surface brightness between old,\nmetal-poor IHL stars and more metal-rich, dynamically-younger tidal streams is\nof crucial importance when estimating the chemical abundance of an intrahalo\npopulation with multiple origins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2008 21:45:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 18:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

This is the typical situation in nuclear physics, where\nHamiltonians are described as functions of the Casimir operators of the groups\ninvolved in some reduction chain.

Specifically, chromospheric hot\nspots rotating in phase with the planet orbital motion have been observed\nduring some seasons in a few stars harbouring hot Jupiters. The spot leads the\nsubplanetary point by a typical amount of about 60-70 degrees, with the extreme\ncase of upsilon And where the angle is about 170 degrees. The interaction\nbetween the star and the planet is described considering the reconnection\nbetween the stellar coronal field and the magnetic field of the planet.\nReconnection events produce energetic particles that moving along magnetic\nfield lines impact onto the stellar chromosphere giving rise to a localized hot\nspot. A simple magnetohydrostatic model is introduced to describe the coronal\nmagnetic field of the star connecting its surface to the orbiting planet. The\nfield is assumed to be axisymmetric around the rotation axis of the star and\nits configuration is more general than a linear force-free field. With a\nsuitable choice of the free parameters, the model can explain the phase\ndifferences between the hot spots and the planets observed in HD 179949,\nupsilon And, HD 189733, and tau Bootis, as well as their visibility modulation\non the orbital period and seasonal time scales. The possible presence of cool\nspots associated with the planets in tau Boo and HD 192263 cannot be explained\nby the present model. However, we speculate about the possibility that\nreconnection events in the corona may influence subphotospheric dynamo action\nin those stars producing localized photospheric (and chromospheric) activity\nmigrating in phase with their planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2008 06:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

High resolution optical (3300 -- 6800 Angstrom) spectra of SN2006X\nat different phase obtained with UVES on the VLT were reduced and analysed.\n  Results. In addition to previously detected atomic (NaI and CaII) and\nmolecular (CN) transitions we present detections of DIBs (6196, 6283 Angstrom),\ndiatomic molecules (CH, CH+) and neutral atoms (CaI) in the spectra of SN2006X\ntaken at different phases (at 2 days before and 14 and 61 days after the\nbrightness maximum).

This is\nconsistent with the conclusion in the literature that SN2006X exploded behind a\ndense interstellar cloud (inferred from strong atomic sodium and calcium lines\nand CN transitions) which caused strong photometric reddening but whose\nmaterial was not directly affected by the supernova explosion.

To define and quantify `chance success' is\nknotty. Some null hypotheses ascribe chance to the Earth: Seismicity is modeled\nas random. The null distribution of the number of successful predictions -- or\nany other test statistic -- is taken to be its distribution when the fixed set\nof predictions is applied to random seismicity. Such tests tacitly assume that\nthe predictions do not depend on the observed seismicity. Conditioning on the\npredictions in this way sets a low hurdle for statistical significance.\nConsider this scheme: When an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 or greater occurs\nanywhere in the world, predict that an earthquake at least as large will occur\nwithin 21 days and within an epicentral distance of 50 km. We apply this rule\nto the Harvard centroid-moment-tensor (CMT) catalog for 2000--2004 to generate\na set of predictions. The null hypothesis is that earthquake times are\nexchangeable conditional on their magnitudes and locations and on the\npredictions--a common ``nonparametric'' assumption in the literature. We\ngenerate random seismicity by permuting the times of events in the CMT catalog.\nWe consider an event successfully predicted only if (i) it is predicted and\n(ii) there is no larger event within 50 km in the previous 21 days. The\n$P$-value for the observed success rate is $<0.001$: The method successfully\npredicts about 5% of earthquakes, far better than `chance,' because the\npredictor exploits the clustering of earthquakes -- occasional foreshocks --\nwhich the null hypothesis lacks. Rather than condition on the predictions and\nuse a stochastic model for seismicity, it is preferable to treat the observed\nseismicity as fixed, and to compare the success rate of the predictions to the\nsuccess rate of simple-minded predictions like those just described. If the\nproffered predictions do no better than a simple scheme, they have little\nvalue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2008 09:25:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

The decreasing of the mean statistical\ndistance between EU countries is reflected in the correlated fluctuations of\nthe basic ME indicators: GDP, GDP/capita, Consumption and Investments. This\nempirical evidence can be seen as an economic aspect of globalization. The\nMoving Average Minimal Length Path (MAMLP) algorithm allows to search for a\ncluster-like structures derived both from the hierarchical organization of\ncountries and from their relative movement inside the hierarchy.

The method is optimized for analyses of extended\nsources with high photon statistics. Suzaku has four XIS detectors each with\nits own X-ray CCD and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and has been providing unique\nopportunities in spatially-resolved spectroscopic analyses of extended objects.\nThe detectors, however, suffer from broad and position-dependent PSFs with\ntheir typical half-power density (HPD) of about 110''. In the authors' view,\nthis shortcoming has been preventing the high collecting area and high spectral\nresolution of Suzaku to be fully exploited. The present method is intended to\nrecover spatial resolution to ~15'' over a dynamic range around 1:100 in the\nbrightness without assuming any source model. Our deconvolution proceeds in two\nsteps: An XIS image is multiplied with the inverse response matrix calculated\nfrom its PSF after rebinning CCD pixels to larger-size tiles (typically 6''x\n6''); The inverted image is then adaptively smoothed to obtain the final\ndeconvolved image. The PSF is modeled on a ray-tracing program and an observed\npoint-source image. The deconvolution method has been applied to images of\nCentaurus A, PSR B1509-58 and RCW 89 taken by one XIS (XIS-1). The results have\nbeen compared with images obtained with Chandra to conclude that the spatial\nresolution has been recovered to ~20'' down to regions where surface brightness\nis about 1:50 of the brightest tile in the image. We believe the spatial\nresolution and the dynamic range can be improved in the future with higher\nfidelity PSF modeling and higher precision pointing information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2008 13:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For finite-alphabet processes one may rely on a\nuniversal data compression scheme like the Lempel-Ziv algorithm to construct\nconditional probability mass function estimates that are consistent in expected\ninformation divergence. Consistency in this strong sense cannot be attained in\na universal sense for all stationary processes with values in an infinite\nalphabet, but weak consistency can. Some applications of the estimates to\non-line forecasting, regression and classification are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2008 13:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

It is shown that, due to the\ntransverse nature of gravitational waves, the surfing effect leads to enormous\npulsar timing residuals if the speed of gravitational waves is smaller than\nspeed of light. This fact allows to place significant constraints on parameter\n$\\epsilon$, which characterizes the relative deviation of the speed of\ngravitational waves from the speed of light. We show that the existing\nconstraints from pulsar timing measurements already place stringent limits on\n$\\epsilon$ and consequently on the mass of graviton $m_g$. These limits on\n$m_g$ are three orders of magnitude stronger than the current constraints from\nSolar System tests. The current constraints also allow to rule out massive\ngravitons as possible candidates for cold dark matter in galactic halo. In the\nnear future, the gravitational wave background from extragalactic super massive\nblack hole binaries, along with the expected sub-microsecond pulsar timing\naccuracy, will allow to achieve constrains of $\\epsilon\\lesssim 0.4\\%$ and\npossibly stronger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2008 15:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We perform\nfinite size scaling to evaluate a length scale associated with dynamical\nheterogeneity which grows as temperature decreases. However, relaxation times\nwhich also grow with decreasing temperature, do not show the same kind of\nscaling behavior with system size as the dynamical heterogeneity, indicating\nthat relaxation times are not solely determined by the length scale of\ndynamical heterogeneity. We show that relaxation times are instead determined,\nfor all studied system sizes and temperatures, by configurational entropy, in\naccordance with the Adam-Gibbs relation, but in disagreement with theoretical\nexpectations based on spin-glass models that configurational entropy is not\nrelevant at temperatures substantially above the critical temperature of mode\ncoupling theory. The temperature dependence of the heterogeneity length scale\nshows significant deviations from theoretical expectations, and the length\nscale one may extract from the system size dependence of the configurational\nentropy has much weaker temperature dependence compared to the heterogeneity\nlength scale at all studied temperatures.
