Starting from simple, but well known experiments, a\nseries of mathematical modeling tools are introduced, and the relation between\nthem is made clear. First, we show how Brownian motion can be understood in\nterms of a simple random walk model. Normal diffusion is then treated (i)\nthrough formalizing the random walk model and deriving a classical diffusion\nequation, (ii) by using Fick's law that leads again to the same diffusion\nequation, and (iii) by using a stochastic differential equation for the\nparticle dynamics (the Langevin equation), which allows to determine the mean\nsquare displacement of particles. (iv) We discuss normal diffusion from the\npoint of view of probability theory, applying the Central Limit Theorem to the\nrandom walk problem, and (v) we introduce the more general Fokker-Planck\nequation for diffusion that includes also advection. We turn then to anomalous\ndiffusion, discussing first its formal characteristics, and proceeding to\nContinuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) as a model for anomalous diffusion. It is\nshown how CTRW can be treated formally, the importance of probability\ndistributions of the Levy type is explained, and we discuss the relation of\nCTRW to fractional diffusion equations and show how the latter can be derived\nfrom the CTRW equations.

The Hall-effect magnetometer was\nfabricated from a two dimensional electron gas GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure in\nthe form of a cross, with a 50x50 um2 sensing area. A high-frequency microstrip\nresonator is coupled with two small gaps to a transmission line with a 50 Ohms\nimpedance. Different resonator lengths are used to obtain quasi-TEM fundamental\nresonant modes in the frequency range 10-30 GHz. The resonator is positioned on\ntop of the active area of the Hall-effect magnetometer, where the magnetic\nfield of the fundamental mode is largest, thus optimizing the conversion of\nmicrowave power into magnetic field at the sample position. The two gaps\ncoupling the resonator and transmission lines are engineered differently. The\ngap to the microwave source is designed to optimize the loaded quality factor\nof the resonator (Q = 150) while the gap for the transmitted signal is larger.\nThis latter gap minimizes losses and prevents distortion of the resonance while\nenabling measurement of the transmitted signal.

The\nconventional (and optimum) norm that is used to conduct the tree traversal step\nin SD is the l-2 norm. It was, however, recently observed that using the\nl-infinity norm instead reduces the hardware complexity of SD considerably at\nonly a marginal performance loss. These savings result from a reduction in the\nlength of the critical path in the circuit and the silicon area required for\nmetric computation, but are also, as observed previously through simulation\nresults, a consequence of a reduction in the computational (i.e., algorithmic)\ncomplexity. The aim of this paper is an analytical performance and\ncomputational complexity analysis of l-infinity norm SD. For i.i.d.

In the\nultimate compressibility limit, thanks to the shock waves which are the\nappropriate dissipative structures, the single-scaling regime is found to\nextend indeed all the way into the full viscous regime.

In the COSTBC, each relay stage separates the\nconstellation symbols of the orthogonal space-time block code sent by the\npreceding relay stage using its CSI, and then transmits another orthogonal\nspace-time block code to the next relay stage. COSTBCs are shown to achieve the\nmaximum diversity gain in a multi-hop wireless network with flat Rayleigh\nfading channels. Several explicit constructions of COSTBCs are also provided\nfor two-hop wireless networks with two and four source antennas and relay\nnodes. It is also shown that COSTBCs require minimum decoding complexity thanks\nto the connection to orthogonal space-time block codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2008 19:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-06"}

We have performed a series\nof 256^3 and 512^3 simulations on supersonic but sub-Alfvenic turbulent systems\nwith AD using the Heavy-Ion Approximation developed in Li, McKee, & Klein\n(2006).

The first purpose is to present an\nexplicit description of expanded cyclic codes defined in $\\GF(q^m)$. The\nproposed explicit construction of expanded generator matrix and expanded parity\ncheck matrix maintains the symbol-wise algebraic structure and thus keeps many\nimportant original characteristics. The second purpose of this paper is to\nidentify a class of constant-weight cyclic codes. Specifically, we show that a\nwell-known class of $q$-ary BCH codes excluding the all-zero codeword are\nconstant-weight cyclic codes. Moreover, we show this class of codes achieve the\nPlotkin bound. The last purpose of the paper is to characterize expanded cyclic\ncodes utilizing the proposed expanded generator matrix and parity check matrix.\nWe characterize the properties of component codewords of a codeword and\nparticularly identify the precise conditions under which a codeword can be\nrepresented by a subbasis. Our developments reveal an alternative while more\ngeneral view on the subspace subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes. With the new\ninsights, we present an improved lower bound on the minimum distance of an\nexpanded cyclic code by exploiting the generalized concatenated structure. We\nalso show that the fixed-rate binary expanded Reed-Solomon codes are\nasymptotically \"bad\", in the sense that the ratio of minimum distance over code\nlength diminishes with code length going to infinity. It overturns the\nprevalent conjecture that they are \"good\" codes and deviates from the ensemble\nof generalized Reed-Solomon codes which asymptotically achieves the\nGilbert-Varshamov bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2008 22:51:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2008 16:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-08"}

It is shown that\nthe nebula model of uniform viscosity does not match the present planet masses.\nBy studying current known viscosity mechanisms, I show that viscosity is more\nefficient in the inner region inside Mercury and the outer region outside\nJupiter-Saturn than the intermediate region. The more efficient viscosity\ndrives faster radial inflow of material during the nebula evolution. Because\nthe inflow in the outer region is faster than the intermediate region, the\nmaterial tends to accumulate in Jupiter-Saturn region which is between the\nouter and intermediate region. It is demonstrated that the gas trapping time of\nJovian planets is longer than the inflow time in the outer region. Therefore\nthe gas already flows to Jupiter-Saturn region before Uranus and Neptune can\ncapture significant gas. But the inflow in the Jupiter-Saturn region is so slow\nthat they can capture large amount of gas before the gas can flow further\ninward. Hence they have larger masses with larger H and He content than Uranus\nand Neptune. I also extend the discussion to the masses of the terrestrial\nplanets, especially low mass of Mercury. The advantages of this theory are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2008 07:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25"}

It was shown that a\nsampling ADC with a bit resolution of 12 bits and a sampling frequency of 100\nMs/s is adequate for achieving an optimal neutron-gamma discrimination for\npulses having a dynamic range for deposited neutron energies of 0.3-12 MeV. An\ninvestigation of the influence of the sampling frequency on the time resolution\nwas made. A FWHM of 1.7 ns was obtained at 100 Ms/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2008 10:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-08"}

Most of these sources have full\nmulti-wavelength coverage from the far-UV to the far-infrared and lie in the\nredshift range 0.1<z<1.3.

We argue\nthat BPS instantons contributing to the superpotential cannot become non-BPS\nanywhere in moduli space, since they cannot account for the required four\ngoldstino fermion zero modes. At most they can reach lines of threshold\nstability, where they split into mutually BPS multi-instantons, as already\ndiscussed in the literature. On the other hand, instantons with additional\nfermion zero modes, contributing to multi-fermion F-terms, can indeed cross\ngenuine lines of marginal stability, beyond which they lead to non-BPS systems.\nThe non-BPS instanton generates an operator which is a D-term locally in moduli\nspace, but not globally. This is due to a cohomological obstruction localized\non the BPS locus, where the D-term must be written as an F-term, thus ensuring\nthe continuity of the 4d contribution to the effective action.

A systematic method for the evaluation of\nthe finite-size corrections to the free energy for the different types of\nboundary conditions is proposed.

Combining the new data with optical data, we\nderived photometric estimates of the distribution of global metallicity [M/H]\nof individual red giant stars from their V-Ks colours. We used the new data to\nderive the properties of a nearly complete sample of asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB) stars in LeoII. Using a near-infrared two-colour diagram, we were able to\nobtain a clean separation from Milky Way foreground stars and discriminate\nbetween carbon- and oxygen-rich AGB stars. We simulate the JHKs data with the\nTRILEGAL population synthesis code together with the most updated thermally\npulsing AGB models, and using the star formation histories derived from\nindependent work based on deep HST photometry. After scaling the mass of LeoII\nmodels to the observed number of upper RGB stars, we find that present models\npredict too many O-rich TP-AGB stars of higher luminosity due to a likely\nunder-estimation of either their mass-loss rates at low metallicity, and/or\ntheir degree of obscuration by circumstellar dust. On the other hand, the\nTP-AGB models are able to reproduce the observed number and luminosities of\ncarbon stars satisfactorily well, indicating that in this galaxy the least\nmassive stars that became carbon stars should have masses as low as ~1 M_sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2008 14:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}
