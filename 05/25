We reexamine the issue on a sample of 48 GCs selected in terms of\nhomogeneity criteria for the photometric data available from the literature and\nperform a model-independent analysis of surface brightness profiles (SBP) and\ndistance moduli, estimating error bars and studying selection effects with\nnon-parametric statistical tests. We determine the coefficients of the FP and\ntheir error bars. The scatter from the FP relation is likely to be intrinsic,\ni.e. not due to measurement errors only. We find that in the standard FP\ncoordinates our sample occupies a slim, axisymmetric region of parameter space,\nsuggesting that the scaling relation might be around a Fundamental Line, rather\nthan a plane, confirming a result noted earlier. This is likely to be the\norigin of the difficulties in the fit by a plane mentioned in previous\ninvestigations. Such FL relation would imply a pure photometric scaling law,\nwhich might be tested on wider samples and on extra-galactic GC systems. We\nfind a correlation of the residuals from the FP relation with the central slope\nof the SBP. No other correlations are found. Finally, we reconstruct the\ndistribution of the values of the quantity log(K_V/(M/L)) (virial coefficient\ndivided by the mass-to-light ratio) through kernel density estimation and find\nevidence for bimodality, which suggests that the galactic GC system may be\ncomposed of at least two dynamically different populations. Yet, these\npopulations do not reflect the standard dichotomy between disk and halo\nclusters.

Each time a clinician has to urgently take a\npatient through a screening procedure to make a reliable decision on the trauma\ntreatment. Typically, such procedure comprises around 20 tests; however the\ncondition of a trauma patient remains very difficult to be tested properly.\nWhat happens if these tests are ambiguously interpreted, and information about\nthe severity of the injury will come misleading? The mistake in a decision can\nbe fatal: using a mild treatment can put a patient at risk of dying from\nposttraumatic shock, while using an overtreatment can also cause death. How can\nwe reduce the risk of the death caused by unreliable decisions? It has been\nshown that probabilistic reasoning, based on the Bayesian methodology of\naveraging over decision models, allows clinicians to evaluate the uncertainty\nin decision making. Based on this methodology, in this paper we aim at\nselecting the most important screening tests, keeping a high performance. We\nassume that the probabilistic reasoning within the Bayesian methodology allows\nus to discover new relationships between the screening tests and uncertainty in\ndecisions. In practice, selection of the most informative tests can also reduce\nthe cost of a screening procedure in trauma care centers. In our experiments we\nuse the UK Trauma data to compare the efficiency of the proposed technique in\nterms of the performance.

In 2003, Chandra allowed the detection of\nthe X-ray counterpart of the radio pulsar, and provided the first evidence for\na compact pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We here present new Chandra observations\nwhich allowed for the first time an imaging and spectroscopic study of the\npulsar and PWN independently of each other. The PWN is only evident in the hard\nband and consists of jet-like structures extending to at least 7\" from the\npulsar, with the southern `jet' being longer than the northern `jet'. The\nspectrum of the PWN is described by a power law with a photon index~1.1 for the\ncompact PWN and ~1.4 for the southern long jet (at a fixed column density of\n1.8E22/cm2), and a total luminosity of 4E32 ergs/s (0.5-7 keV), at a distance\nof 8.4 kpc. The pulsar's spectrum is clearly softer than the PWN's spectrum. We\nrule out a single blackbody model for the pulsar, and present the first\nevidence of non-thermal (presumably magnetospheric) emission that dominates\nabove ~3keV. A two-component model consisting of a power law component (with\nphoton index ~1.5--2.0) plus a thermal component provides the best fit. The\nthermal component can be fit by either a blackbody model with a temperature\nkT~0.21 keV, or a neutron star atmospheric model with a temperature kT~0.14\nkeV. The efficiency of the pulsar in converting its rotational power, Edot,\ninto non-thermal X-ray emission from the pulsar and PWN is ~5E-4, comparable to\nother rotation-powered pulsars with a similar Edot. We discuss our results in\nthe context of the X-ray manifestation of high-magnetic field radio pulsars in\ncomparison with rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 May 2008 03:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Labeled Cortical Distance Map (LCDM), can be a powerful tool to\nquantize such morphometric differences. In this article, we investigate various\nissues regarding the analysis of LCDM distances in relation to morphometry. The\nlength of the LCDM distance vector provides the number of voxels (approximately\na multiple of volume (in mm^3)); median, mode, range, and variance of LCDM\ndistances are all suggestive of size, thickness, and shape differences. However\nthese measures provide a crude summary based on LCDM distances which may convey\nmuch more information about the tissue in question. To utilize more of this\ninformation, we pool (merge) the LCDM distances from subjects in the same group\nor condition. The statistical methodology we employ require normality and\nwithin and between sample independence. We demonstrate that the violation of\nthese assumptions have mild influence on the tests. We specify the types of\nalternatives the parametric and nonparametric tests are more sensitive for. We\nalso show that the pooled LCDM distances provide powerful results for group\ndifferences in distribution, left-right morphometric asymmetry of the tissues,\nand variation of LCDM distances.
