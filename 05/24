We then use extended Press-Schechter\nformalism to argue that this assumption may be violated and the scale dependent\nbias will depend on other properties, such as merging history of halos. In\nparticular, in the limit of recent mergers we find the effect is suppressed.\nNext we use these predictions in conjunction with a compendium of large scale\ndata to put a limit on the value of f_NL. When combining all data assuming that\nhalo occupation depends only on halo mass, we get a limit of -29 ~ (-65)< f_NL\n< +70 ~(+93) at 95% (99.7%) confidence. While we use a wide range of datasets,\nour combined result is dominated by the signal from the SDSS photometric quasar\nsample.

This paper reviews the most recent direct searches for Higgs bosons and\nbeyond-the-standard-model (BSM) physics at the Tevatron. The results reported\ncorrespond to an integrated luminosity of up to 2.5 fb-1 of Run II data\ncollected by the two Collaborations. Searches covered include: the standard\nmodel (SM) Higgs boson (including sensitivity projections), the neutral Higgs\nbosons in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM),\ncharged Higgs bosons and extended Higgs models, supersymmetric decays that\nconserve or violate R-parity, gauge-mediated supersymmetric breaking models,\nlong-lived particles, leptoquarks, compositeness, extra gauge bosons, extra\ndimensions, and finally signature-based searches. Given the excellent\nperformance of the collider and the continued productivity of the experiments,\nthe Tevatron physics potential looks promising for discovery with the coming\nlarger data sets. In particular, evidence for the SM Higgs boson could be\nobtained if its mass is light or near 160 GeV. The observed (expected) upper\nlimits are currently a factor of 3.7 (3.3) higher than the expected SM Higgs\nboson cross section at m_H=115 GeV and 1.1 (1.6) at m_H=160 GeV at 95% C.L.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2008 18:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-18"}

From these and similar data compiled from\nthe literature for other Local Group galaxies, we consider the origin and\nevolution of the stellar progenitors of bright planetary nebulae in galaxies\nwhere star formation ceased long ago. The ratio of neon to oxygen abundances in\nbright planetary nebulae is either identical to that measured in the\ninterstellar medium of star-forming dwarf galaxies or at most changed by a few\npercent, indicating that neither abundance is significantly altered as a result\nof the evolution of their stellar progenitors. Several planetary nebulae appear\nto have dredged up oxygen, but these are the exception, not the rule. The\nprogenitors of bright planetary nebulae typically enhance their original helium\nabundances by less than 50%. In contrast, nitrogen enhancements can reach\nfactors of 100. However, nitrogen often shows little or no enhancement,\nsuggesting that nitrogen enrichment is a random process. The helium, oxygen,\nand neon abundances argue that the typical bright planetary nebulae in all of\nthe galaxies considered here are the progeny of stars with initial masses of\napproximately 1.5 Msun or less, based upon the nucleosynthesis predictions of\ncurrent theoretical models. These models, however, are unable to explain the\nnitrogen enrichment or its scatter. Similar conclusions hold for the bright\nplanetary nebulae in galaxies with ongoing star formation.

Assuming that Planck can provide a cosmic\nvariance limited E-mode polarization map at $l<20$ and S/N $\\sim 1$ kSZ\nestimates can be gathered for all clusters more massive than $10^{14}\nM_{\\odot}$, then this cross-correlation should be measured at the 2--3 $\\sigma$\nlevel. Further, if an all-sky ACT or SPT type CMB experiment provides similar\nkSZ measurements for all halos above $10^{13} M_{\\odot}$, then the\ncross-correlation total signal to noise (S/N) ratio should be at the level of\n4--5. A detection of this cross-correlation would provide direct and definite\nevidence of bulk flows and missing baryons simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2008 20:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Apply both methods on a Integrated Sachs Wolfe (ISW) - Large\nScale Structure (LSS) cross correlation scenario and study how sky masks\ninfluence the multipole range where signal arises and its comparison to\ntheoretical predictions.\n  Methods: The MF requires the inversion of a multipole covariance matrix that\nif $f_{sky} \\lt 1$ is generally non-diagonal and singular. We use a SVD\napproach that focuses on those modes carrying most of the information. We\ncompare the MF to the ACPS in ISW-LSS Monte Carlo simulations, paying attention\non the effect that a limited sky coverage has on the cross-correlation results.\n  Results: Within the linear data model for which the MF is defined, the MF\nperforms comparatively better than the ACPS for smaller values of $f_{sky}$ and\nscale dependent (non-Poissonian) noise fields. In the context of ISW studies\nboth methods are comparable, although the MF performs slightly more sensitively\nunder more restrictive masks.

We compare these calculations with\nmeasurements and find excellent agreement in cavities with empty-cavity\nfinesses in the range 10^4 to 10^5. The imaginary part of the membrane's index\nof refraction is found to be approximately 10^(-4). We calculate the laser\ncooling performance of this system, with a particular focus on the\nless-intuitive regime in which photons \"tunnel\" through the membrane on a time\nscale comparable to the membrane's period of oscillation. Lastly, we present\ncalculations of quantum non-demolition measurements of the membrane's phonon\nnumber in the low signal-to-noise regime where the phonon lifetime is\ncomparable to the QND readout time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2008 21:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, most infrastructure networks evolve and\noperate in a highly decentralized fashion, which may significantly impact the\nallocation of resources across the system. Here, we investigate this question\nby focusing on the relation between capacity and load in different types of\nreal-world communication and transportation networks. We find strong empirical\nevidence that the actual capacity of the network elements tends to be similar\nto the maximum available capacity, if the cost is not strongly constraining. As\nmore weight is given to the cost, however, the capacity approaches the load\nnonlinearly. In particular, all systems analyzed show larger unoccupied\nportions of the capacities on network elements subjected to smaller loads,\nwhich is in sharp contrast with the assumptions involved in (linear) models\nproposed in previous theoretical studies. We describe the observed behavior of\nthe capacity-load relation as a function of the relative importance of the cost\nby using a model that optimizes capacities to cope with network traffic\nfluctuations. These results suggest that infrastructure systems have evolved\nunder pressure to minimize local failures, but not necessarily global failures\nthat can be caused by the spread of local damage through cascading processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2008 22:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-29"}

Surveys have shown that, around Jupiter, such a region extends from\nthe outermost regular satellite Callisto, to the vicinity of Themisto, the\ninnermost irregular satellite. To understand the reason for the existence of\nsuch a satellite-void region, we have studied the dynamical evolution of Jovian\nirregulars by numerically integrating the orbits of several hundred test\nparticles, distributed in a region between 30 and 80 Jupiter-radii, for\ndifferent values of their semimajor axes, orbital eccentricities, and\ninclinations.

However, these perturbations cannot\naccount for the lack of irregular satellites in the entire region between\nCallisto and Themisto. It is suggested that at distances between 60 and 80\nJupiter-radii, Ganymede and Callisto may have long-term perturbative effects,\nwhich may require the integrations to be extended to times much longer than 10\nMyr. The interactions of irregular satellites with protosatellites of Jupiter\nat the time of the formation of Jovian regulars may also be a destabilizing\nmechanism in this region.

Our result for a_{mu}^{pipi}\nintegrated over the mass range sqrt{s} = 2m_{pi} - 1.8 GeV/c^2 is a_{mu}^{pipi}\n= (523.5 +/- 1.5 (exp) +/- 2.6 (Br) +/- 2.5 (isospin))x 10^{-10}, where the\nfirst error is due to the experimental uncertainties, the second is due to the\nuncertainties in the branching fractions and the third is due to the\nuncertainties in the isospin-violating corrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 May 2008 14:42:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Sep 2008 14:55:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2008 13:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Tanaka and S. Kashiwaya 1996\n\\textit{Phys. Rev. B} {\\bf 53}, R11957]. For the case of High $T_c$\nsuperconductors, the $c$-axes are parallel to an interface with finite\ntransparency and their $ab$-planes have a mis-orientation. The effect of\ntransparency and mis-orientation on the currents is studied both analytically\nand numerically. It is observed that, the current phase relations are totally\ndifferent from the case of ideal transparent Josephson junctions between d-wave\nsuperconductors and two s-wave superconductors. This apparatus can be used to\ndemonstrate d-wave order parameter in High $T_c$ superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 May 2008 15:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The observed deviation, however, is smaller\nthan the calculated values for perfectly conducting surfaces, possibly due to\nthe interplay between finite conductivity and geometry effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 May 2008 15:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-15"}

Performance is the ability of a model, or average, to reproduce a\nsequence of observations of the process. We identify a condition that\ndetermines if a single model performs better than the average. That result also\nyields a necessary condition for when the average performs better than any\nindividual model. We also give sharp bounds for the performance of the average\non a given interval. Since the observation interval is fixed, performance is\nevaluated in a vector space, and we can add intuition to our results by\nexplaining them geometrically. We conclude with some comments on directions\nstatistical tests of performance might take.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2008 20:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2008 17:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-10"}
