Here we demonstrate an alternative\napproach, whereby a harmonic driving field sweeps the atom through its\nenergy-level avoided crossings at a fixed frequency, surmounting many of the\nlimitations of the conventional approach. Spectroscopic information is obtained\nfrom the amplitude dependence of the system response. The resulting\n``spectroscopy diamonds'' contain interference patterns and population\ninversion that serve as a fingerprint of the atom's spectrum. By analyzing\nthese features, we determine the energy spectrum of a manifold of states with\nenergies from 0.01 to 120 GHz \\times h in a superconducting artificial atom,\nusing a driving frequency near 0.1 GHz. This approach provides a means to\nmanipulate and characterize systems over a broad bandwidth, using only a single\ndriving frequency that may be orders of magnitude smaller than the energy\nscales being probed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 May 2008 18:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-10"}

Over the\nlast forty years, our understanding of the GRB phenomenon has progressed\ndramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise that\nprovide access to a regime not yet probed. GRB 080319B presented such an\nopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked at\na visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. It was\ncaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burst\nlocation from before the time of the explosion. The combination of these unique\noptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerful\ndiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of its\nformation. Here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions from\nthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the same\nphysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying an\nextremely relativistic outflow. The chromatic behaviour of the broadband\nafterglow is consistent with viewing the GRB down the very narrow inner core of\na two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistent\nwith the massive star origin of long GRBs. These circumstances can explain the\nextreme properties of this GRB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 May 2008 19:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

This integration scheme imposes non-physiological constraints on the\ntime constants of the synaptic currents it attempts to model which hamper the\ngeneral applicability. This paper addresses this problem in two ways. First, we\nprovide physical arguments to show why these constraints on the time constants\ncan be relaxed. Second, we give a formal proof showing which constraints can be\nabolished. This proof rests on a generalization of the Carnevale-Hines lemma,\nwhich is a new tool for comparing double exponentials as they naturally occur\nin many cascaded decay systems including receptor-neurotransmitter dissociation\nfollowed by channel closing. We show that this lemma can be generalized and\nsubsequently used for lifting most of the original constraints on the time\nconstants.

To characterize\nthe existing phase transitions, we consider the magnetization and the\npopulation number as order parameters. We observe that the magnetization is\ngood at probing the high temperature transition but fails in the analysis of\nthe low temperature transition.

This is in contrast to the < 10e23 W/Hz sources where there is a near\n50% detection rate of 21-cm absorption.\n  The mix of 21-cm detections and non-detections is currently attributed to\norientation effects, where according to unified schemes of active galactic\nnuclei, 21-cm absorption is more likely to occur in sources designated as radio\ngalaxies (type-2 objects, where the nucleus is viewed through dense obscuring\ncircumnuclear gas) than in quasars(type-1 objects, where we have a direct view\nto the nucleus). However, due to the exclusively high ultra-violet luminosities\nof our targets it is not clear whether orientation effects alone can wholly\naccount for the distribution, although there exists the possibility that the\nlarge luminosities are indicative of a changing demographic of galaxy types.

We observed 13CO(1-0)\nand CS(2-1) emission toward S235 with the Onsala Space Observatory 20-m\ntelescope and analysed the star density distribution with archival data from\nthe 2MASS survey. Dense molecular gas forms a shell-like structure at the\nsouth-eastern part of S235. The young clusters found with 2MASS data are\nembedded in this shell. The positional relationship of the clusters, the\nmolecular shell and the HII region indicates that expansion of S235 is\nresponsible for the formation of the clusters. The gas distribution in the S235\nmolecular complex is clumpy, which hampers interpretation exclusively on the\nbasis of the morphology of the star forming region. We use data on kinematics\nof molecular gas to support the hypothesis of induced star formation, and\ndistinguish three basic types of molecular gas components. The first type is\nprimordial undisturbed gas of the giant molecular cloud, the second type is gas\nentrained in motion by expansion of the HII region (this is where the embedded\nclusters were formed), and the third type is a fast-moving gas, which might\nhave been accelerated by winds from the newly formed clusters. The clumpy\ndistribution of molecular gas and its kinematics around the HII region implies\nthat the picture of triggered star formation around S235 can be a mixture of at\nleast two possibilities: the \"collect-and-collapse\" scenario and the\ncompression of pre-existing dense clumps by the shock wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2008 07:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Using this fact, we\nshow that the \"effective metric\" of the quotient space does not allow the\ncomplete separability for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, albeit such a\nseparability occurs in the original spacetime of the black hole. We also show\nthat only for two special cases of interest the Hamilton-Jacobi equation admits\nthe complete separation of variables and therefore the integrability for the\nstationary string motion in the original background: namely, when the black\nhole has zero electric charge or it has an arbitrary electric charge, but two\nequal angular momenta.

In Lamastra, Perola & Matt (2006) the\ngravitational effect of the SMBH on the molecular interstellar gas, in the\ncentral region of the host galaxy, was shown to predict an anti-correlation\nbetween f_{abs} and M_{BH}. The most recent findings on the distribution of the\nEddington ratio \\lambda=L_b/L_E as a function of M_{BH} and z are used to\nconvert that relationship into one between f_{abs} and both bolometric (L_b)\nand X-ray (L_X) luminosities at various values of z. The findings on\n\\lambda(M_{BH},z) are properly treated in order to ensure completeness in the\nprediction of f_{abs} above a certain luminosity, at values of z=0.1, 0.35, 0.7\nand >1. To verify the consequence of these findings alone, we adopted in a\nfirst istance a distribution of gas surface density \\Sigma, observed in a\nsample of local spiral galaxies, irrespective of the galaxy morphological type\nand z. Assuming in the \\lambda(M_{BH},z) distribution the Eddington limit,\n\\lambda=1, as a ``natural'' cut-off, the predictions are consistent with the\nexistence of an anti-correlation between f_{abs} and L_X, but fail to reproduce\nan increase of f_{abs} with z. Because the early type galaxies on average are\nmuch poorer in molecular gas than late type ones, a quantitative agreement with\nthe local value of f_{abs} requires the existence of a correlation between\n\\Sigma and the central activity. An increase of typical values of \\Sigma with\nz, correlated with the activity, might explain an increase of f_{abs} with z.\nHowever, at the highest luminosities f_{abs} could hardly exceed about 0.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2008 09:16:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 14:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In light of the new high\nresolution observations, we revisit the study of the quiet Sun's topological\nnature. Topology is a tool to explain the complexity of the magnetic field, the\noccurrence of reconnection processes, and the heating of the corona. This\nLetter aims to give new insights to these different topics. Using a\nhigh-resolution Hinode/SOT observation of the line-of-sight magnetic field on\nthe photosphere, we calculate the three dimensional magnetic field in the\nregion above assuming a potential field. From the 3D field, we determine the\nexistence of null points in the magnetic configuration. From this model of a\ncontinuous field, we find that the distribution of null points with height is\nsignificantly different from that reported in previous studies. In particular,\nthe null points are mainly located above the bottom boundary layer in the\nphotosphere (54%) and in the chromosphere (44%) with only a few null points in\nthe corona (2%). The density of null points (expressed as the ratio of the\nnumber of null points to the number of photospheric magnetic fragments) in the\nsolar atmosphere is estimated to be between 3% and 8% depending on the method\nused to identify the number of magnetic fragments in the observed photosphere.\nThis study reveals that the heating of the corona by magnetic reconnection at\ncoronal null points is unlikely. Our findings do not rule out the heating of\nthe corona at other topological features.

The spatial segregation occurs\nwhen members of a class tend to be found near members of the same class (i.e.,\nnear conspecifics) while spatial association occurs when members of a class\ntend to be found near members of the other class or classes.

In the\nexisting literature, relatively little attention has been given to the\ninfluence of neuron shape on the overall connectivity and dynamics of the\nemerging networks. The current work addresses this issue by considering\nsimplified neuronal shapes consisting of circular regions (soma/axons) with\nspokes (dendrites). Networks are grown by placing these patterns randomly in\nthe 2D plane and establishing connections whenever a piece of dendrite falls\ninside an axon. Several topological and dynamical properties of the resulting\ngraph are measured, including the degree distribution, clustering coefficients,\nsymmetry of connections, size of the largest connected component, as well as\nthree hierarchical measurements of the local topology. By varying the number of\nprocesses of the individual basic patterns, we can quantify relationships\nbetween the individual neuronal shape and the topological and dynamical\nfeatures of the networks. Integrate-and-fire dynamics on these networks is also\ninvestigated with respect to transient activation from a source node,\nindicating that long-range connections play an important role in the\npropagation of avalanches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2008 14:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
