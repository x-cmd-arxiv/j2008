However, the majority of short GRBs\nappear to occur in star forming galaxies, raising the possibility that some\nprogenitors are related to recent star formation activity. Here we present\noptical spectroscopy of these hosts and measure their luminosities, star\nformation rates, and metallicities. We find luminosities of L_B~0.1-1.5 L*,\nstar formation rates of SFR~0.2-6 M_sun/yr, and metallicities of\n12+log(O/H)~8.5-8.9 (Z~0.6-1.6 Z_sun). A detailed comparison to the hosts of\nlong GRBs reveals systematically higher luminosities, lower specific star\nformation rates (SFR/L_B) by about an order of magnitude, and higher\nmetallicities by about 0.6 dex. The K-S probability that the short and long GRB\nhosts are drawn from the same underlying galaxy distribution is only 10^-3. On\nthe other hand, short GRB hosts exhibit excellent agreement with the specific\nstar formation rates and the luminosity-metallicity relation of field galaxies\nat z~0.1-1. We thus conclude that short GRB hosts are not dominated by young\nstellar populations like long GRBs hosts. Instead, short GRB hosts appear to be\ndrawn uniformly from the underlying galaxy distribution, indicating that the\nprogenitors have a wide age distribution of several Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 May 2008 19:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

The normally unobservable long\nwave lengths are made observable by having the radioactive source move a long\ndistance circulating around in a storage ring. A new oscillation phenomenon\nwith nonexponential decay arises in this \"watched pot\" experiment where\ncontinous monitoring sets the decay clock back to zero while preserving\noscillating phases in the initial state. The initial ion wave packet has a\nmomentum spread required by Heisenberg and contains pairs of components with\ndifferent momenta and energies.

The HGV2C\nmethod involves the construction of a computer ego (CE) based on an individual\nobject that can be either a part of the system under analysis or a newly\ncreated object based on a certain hypothesis. The CE provides a capability to\nanalyze data from a specific standpoint, e.g. from a viewpoint of a certain\nobject. The CE is constructed from two identical copies of a query object, and\nits functioning mechanism involves: a hypothesis-parameter (HP) and\ninfothyristor (IT). HP is a parameter that is introduced into an existing set\nof parameters. The HP value for one of the clones of a query object is set to\nequal 1, whereas for another clone it is greater than 1. The IT is based on the\npreviously described algorithm of iterative averaging and performs three\nfunctions: 1) computation of a similarity matrix for the group of three objects\nincluding two clones of a query object and a target object; 2) division of the\ngroup into two alternative subgroups; and 3) a successive increase of the HP\nweight in the totality of all the parameters. Initially, both clones of the\nquery object appear together in one of the subgroups as all of their parameter\nvalues, except the HP, are identical. At a certain point of the HP\nmultiplication, one of the clones moves to the group of the target object.

Recently, its counterpart has been identified\nwith a supergiant star, therefore the source can be classified as member of the\nnewly discovered class of Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs),\nspecifically it is the one with the highest duty cycle. Aims: to characterize\nthe quiescent X-ray behaviour of the source and to compare its broad band\nspectrum to that during fast X-ray flares. Methods: we performed an analysis of\nIBIS and JEM-X data with OSA 5.1 as well as an analysis of archival Swift/XRT\ndata. Results: we present results from a long term monitoring of IGR\nJ16479-4514 with detailed spectral and timing informations on 19 bright fast\nX-ray flares, 10 of which newly discovered. We also report for the first time\nresults on the quiescent X-ray emission; the typical luminosity value (about\n10^34 erg s^-1) is about 2 orders of magnitude greater than that typical of\nSFXTs while its broad band X-ray spectrum has a shape very similar to that\nduring fast X-ray transient activity, i.e. a rather steep power law with\nGamma=2.6. Conclusions: IGR J16479$-$4514 is characterized by a quiescent X-ray\nluminosity higher than that typical of other known SFXTs but lower than\npersistent emission from classical SGXBs. We suggest that such source is a kind\nof transition object between these two systems, supporting the idea that there\nis a continuum of behaviours between the class of SFXTs and that of classical\npersistent SGXBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2008 09:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Aims: We study\nphysical properties of the hot (~20 keV) gas clump in the south-east (SE)\nregion discovered by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect observations, to\nunderstand the gas physics of a violent cluster merger. We also explore a\nsignature of non-thermal emission using the hard X-ray data. Results: We find\nthat the single-temperature model fails to reproduce the continuum emission and\nFe-K lines measured by XIS simultaneously. The two-temperature model with a\nvery hot component improves the fit, although the XIS data can only give a\nlower bound on its temperature. We detect the hard X-ray emission in the 12-40\nkeV band at the 7 sigma level; however, the significance becomes marginal when\nthe systematic error in the background estimation is included. With the Suzaku\n+ Chandra joint analysis, we determine the temperature of the SE excess\ncomponent to be 25.3^{+6.1}_{-4.5} ^{+6.9}_{-9.5} keV (90% statistical and\nsystematic errors), which is in an excellent agreement with the previous SZ +\nX-ray analysis. This is the first time that the X-ray spectroscopy alone gives\na good measurement of the temperature of the hot component in the SE region,\nwhich is made possible by Suzaku's unprecedented sensitivity to the wide X-ray\nband. These results strongly indicate that the cluster has undergone a recent,\nviolent merger. The spectral analysis shows that the SE component is consistent\nwith being thermal. We find the 3 sigma upper limit on the non-thermal flux, F\n< 8e-12 erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 12-60 keV band. Combining this limit with a\nrecent discovery of the radio mini halo at 1.4 GHz, we find a lower limit on\nthe strength of the intracluster magnetic field, B > 0.007 micro G.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2008 10:15:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 12:39:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The ratio of Seyfert 1 to Seyfert 2 is significantly more than the\nratio found in the optical, which may be evidence for a receding torus, but\ncould also be due to absorption columns > 10^{25} cm^{-2}. None of the\npredicted Compton-thick objects is detected unambiguously; when taking lower\nlimits on Nh into account, the fraction of these objects is found to be lower\nthan 24%. We do not see, but cannot exclude, a relationship between absorption\nand luminosity similar to what is seen in the 2-10 keV band. Our data suggests\nthe possibility of a lack of objects with 10^{21} < Nh < 10^{22} cm^{-2}, as\nexpected if absorption originates either in a torus-like structure or in the\nhost galaxy. We find that the Log N-Log S diagram of our sources is compatible\nwith those obtained in other surveys in hard X-rays. Compared to models of the\nAGN population selected in the 2-10 keV band, the Log N-Log S diagram is\ngenerally in good agreement, but the Nh distribution is significantly\ndifferent, with significantly less unabsorbed sources (Nh<10^{22} cm^{-2}) at a\ngiven flux limit compared to the models.

The relations to other criteria of classicality are established.\nWe explain why, during inflation, most of these criteria are not intrinsic.

The basic hypothesis in the interpretation of the observations is that\nthe emitting region is homogeneous along the line of sight. Actually, stellar\njets are in general not homogeneous, and therefore line of sight convolution\neffects may lead to the main uncertainty in the determination of the physical\nparameters.\n  AIMS: This paper is aimed at showing the systematic errors introduced when\nassuming an homogeneous medium, and studying the effect of an inhomogeneous\nmedium on plasma diagnostics for the case of a stellar jet. In addition, we\nexplore how to reconstruct the volumetric physical parameters of the jet (i.\ne., with dependence both across and along the line of sight).\n  METHODS: We use standard techniques to determine the physical parameters, i.\ne., the electron density, temperature and hydrogen ionisation fraction across\nthe jet, and a multi-Gaussian method to invert the Abel transform and determine\nthe reconstructed physical structure.\n  RESULTS: When assuming an homogeneous medium the physical parameters,\nintegrated along the line of sight, do not represent the average of the true\nvalues, and do not have a clear physical interpretation. We show that when some\ninformation is available on the emissivity profile across the jet, it is then\npossible to obtain appropriate derivations of the electron density, temperature\nand ionisation fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2008 15:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
