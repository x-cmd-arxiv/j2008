The new KamLAND data\ncauses a significant reduction of the allowed range of $\\Delta m^2_{21}$,\ndetermining it with an unprecedented precision of 8.3% at 3$\\sigma$. The\nprecision of $\\Delta m^2_{21}$ is controlled practically by the KamLAND data\nalone.

These measures can be expressed as convex optimization problems.\nWe show that the dual formulations have a striking interpretation, since they\ncoincide with maximum violations of Bell and Tsirelson inequalities. The dual\nexpressions are closely related to the winning probability of XOR games. These\nlower bounds subsume many known communication complexity lower bound methods,\nmost notably the recent lower bounds of Linial and Shraibman for the special\ncase of Boolean functions.\n  We show that the gap between the quantum and classical lower bounds is at\nmost linear in the size of the support of the distribution, and does not depend\non the size of the inputs. This translates into a bound on the gap between\nmaximal Bell and Tsirelson inequality violations, which was previously known\nonly for the case of distributions with Boolean outcomes and uniform marginals.\n  Finally, we give an exponential upper bound on quantum and classical\ncommunication complexity in the simultaneous messages model, for any\nnon-signaling distribution.

These z~7 Lyman-Break Galaxy\n(LBG) candidates allow us to constrain the Luminosity Function (LF) of the star\nforming galaxy population at those epochs. By assuming a change in only M* and\nadopting a linear evolution in redshift, anchored to the measured values at\nz~6, the best fit evolution coefficient is found to be 0.43+-0.19 mag per unit\nredshift (0.36+-0.18, if including all four candidates), which provides a value\nof M*(z=7.2)=-19.7+-0.3. This implies a steady evolution for the LBG LF out to\nz~7, at the same rate that is observed throughout the z~3 to 6 period. This\nputs a strong constraint on the star-formation histories of z~6 galaxies, whose\nensemble star-formation rate density must be lower by a factor 2 at ~170 Myr\nbefore the epoch at which they are observed. In particular, a large fraction of\nstars in the z~6 LBG population must form at redshifts well above z~7.\nExtrapolating this steady evolution of the LF out to higher redshifts, we\nestimate that galaxies would be able to reionize the universe by z~6, provided\nthat the faint-end slope of the z>7 LF steepens to alpha~-1.9, and that faint\ngalaxies, with luminosities below the current detection limits, contribute a\nsubstantial fraction of the required ionizing photons. This scenario gives\nhowever an integrated optical depth to electron scattering that is ~2sigma\nbelow the WMAP-5 measurement. Therefore, altogether, our results indicate that,\nshould galaxies be the primary contributors to reionization, either the\ncurrently detected evolution of the galaxy population slows down at z>7, or the\nLF evolution must be compensated by a decrease in metallicity and a\ncorresponding increase in ionization efficiency at these early epochs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 17:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 12:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We\nconsider relaxation processes induced by inelastic electron-electron\ninteractions in a disordered Luttinger liquid, focusing on the equilibration\nrate and its essential differences from the electron-electron scattering rate\nas well as the rate of phase relaxation. In the first part of the paper, we\nreview the basic concepts in the disordered Luttinger liquid at equilibrium.\nThese include the elastic renormalization, dephasing, and interference-induced\nlocalization. In the second part, we formulate a conceptually important\nframework for systematically studying the nonequilibrium properties of the\nstrongly correlated (non-Fermi) Luttinger liquid. We derive a coupled set of\nkinetic equations for the fermionic and bosonic distribution functions that\ndescribe the evolution of the nonequilibrium Luttinger liquid. Remarkably, the\nenergy equilibration rate in the conducting disordered quantum wire (at\nsufficiently high temperature, when the localization effects are suppressed by\ndephasing) is shown to be of the order of the rate of elastic scattering off\ndisorder, independent of the interaction constant and temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 18:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-09"}

The services called during the orchestration guarantee a given\nperformance to the orchestrater, usually in the form of contracts. These\ncontracts can be used by the orchestrater to deduce the contract it can offer\nto its own clients, by performing contract composition. An implicit assumption\nin contract based QoS management is: \"the better the component services\nperform, the better the orchestration's performance will be\". Thus, contract\nbased QoS management for Web services orchestrations implicitly assumes\nmonotony. In some orchestrations, however, monotony can be violated, i.e., the\nperformance of the orchestration improves when the performance of a component\nservice degrades. This is highly undesirable since it can render the process of\ncontract composition inconsistent. In this paper we define monotony for\norchestrations modelled by Colored Occurrence Nets (CO-nets) and we\ncharacterize the classes of monotonic orchestrations. We show that few\norchestrations are indeed monotonic, mostly since latency can be traded for\nquality of data. We also propose a sound refinement of monotony, called\nconditional monotony, which forbids this kind of cheating and show that\nconditional monotony is widely satisfied by orchestrations.

Despite steady improvements in the size and\nquality of disk samples over the last decade, many aspects of galaxy disk\nevolution remain unclear.

We also compute the size function of\na very large sample of disks from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to use as a\nlocal (z ~ 0.1) comparison. CFHTLS size functions computed with the same fixed\nluminosity-size selection window at all redshifts exhibit evolution that\nappears to be best modelled by a pure number density evolution. The z = 0.3\nsize function is an excellent match to the z = 0.9 one if disks at the highest\nredshift are a factor of 2.5 more abundant than in the local universe. The SDSS\nsize function would also match the z = 0.9 CFHTLS size function very well with\na similar change in number density. On the other hand, the CFHTLS size\nfunctions computed with a varying luminosity-size selection window with\nredshift remain constant if the selection window is shifted by 1.0$-$1.5 mag\ntowards fainter magnitudes with decreasing redshift. There is a weak dependence\non disk scale length with smaller ($h \\lesssim $ 4 kpc) disks requiring more\nluminosity evolution than larger ones.

(2007), we study the average colour and average concentration of satellite\ngalaxies as function of (i) their stellar mass, (ii) their group mass, and\n(iii) their group-centric radius. We find that the colours and concentrations\nof satellite galaxies are (almost) completely determined by their stellar mass.\nIn particular, at fixed stellar mass, the average colours and concentrations of\nsatellite galaxies are independent of either halo mass or halo-centric radius.\nWe find clear evidence for mass segregation of satellite galaxies in haloes of\nall masses, and argue that this explains why satellites at smaller halo-centric\nradii are somewhat redder and somewhat more concentrated. In addition, the weak\ncolour and concentration dependence of satellite galaxies on halo mass is\nsimply a reflection of the fact that more massive haloes host, on average, more\nmassive satellites. Combining these results with the fact that satellite\ngalaxies are, on average, redder and somewhat more concentrated than central\ngalaxies of the same stellar mass, the following picture emerges: galaxies\nbecome redder and somewhat more concentrated once they fall into a bigger halo\n(i.e., once they become a satellite galaxy). This is a clear manifestation of\nenvironment dependence. However, there is no indication that the magnitude of\nthe transformation (or its timescale) depends on environment; a galaxy\nundergoes a transition when it becomes a satellite, but it does not matter\nwhether it becomes a satellite of a small (Milky Way sized) halo, or of a\nmassive cluster.

However, at higher-z, the\nenvironment distribution of K+A galaxies is more similar to red galaxies than\nto blue galaxies. We conclude that the quenching of star formation and the\nbuild-up of the red sequence through the K+A phase is happening in relatively\noverdense environments at z~1 but in relatively underdense environments at z~0.\nAlthough the relative environments where quenching occurs are decreasing with\ntime, the corresponding absolute environment may have stayed the same along\nwith the quenching mechanisms, because the mean absolute environments of all\ngalaxies has to grow with time.

Recent experiments on Fermi gases have realized a\nphase transition to a Fermi superfluid state with strong interparticle\ninteractions. This system is a realization of the BCS-BEC crossover connecting\nthe physics of BCS superconductivity and that of Bose-Einstein condensation\n(BEC). While many aspects of this system have been investigated, it has not yet\nbeen possible to measure the single-particle excitation spectrum, which is a\nfundamental property directly predicted by many-body theories. Here we show\nthat the single-particle spectral function of the strongly interacting Fermi\ngas at T ~ Tc is dramatically altered in a way that is consistent with a large\npairing gap. We use photoemission spectroscopy to directly probe the elementary\nexcitations and energy dispersion in the Fermi gas of atoms. In these\nphotoemission experiments, an rf photon ejects an atom from our strongly\ninteracting system via a spin-flip transition to a weakly interacting state. We\nmeasure the occupied single-particle density of states for an ultracold Fermi\ngas of 40-potassium atoms at the cusp of the BCS-BEC crossover and on the BEC\nside of the crossover, and compare these results to that for a nearly ideal\nFermi gas. Our results probe the many-body physics in a way that could be\ncompared to data for high-Tc superconductors. This new measurement technique\nfor ultracold atom gases, like photoemission spectroscopy for electronic\nmaterials, directly probes low energy excitations and thus can reveal\nexcitation gaps and/or pseudogaps.

We show that working in the basis of\nthe thermal driving force both simplifies the calculations and provides\nadditional insight to why various approximate (not optimal) estimation\ntechniques perform as they do. To illustrate this point, we compare the\nvariance in the optimal estimator that we derive for thermal noise with those\nof two approximate methods which, like the optimal estimator, suppress the\ncontribution to the variance that would come from the irrelevant, resonant\nmotion of the oscillator. We discuss how these methods fare when the dominant\nnoise process is either white displacement noise or noise with power spectral\ndensity that is inversely proportional to the frequency ($1/f$ noise). We also\nconstruct, in the basis of the driving force, an estimator that performs well\nfor a mixture of white noise and thermal noise. To find the optimal\nmulti-parameter estimators for thermal noise, we derive and illustrate a\ngeneralization of traditional matrix methods for parameter estimation that can\naccommodate continuous data.

In this paper we\nuse empirical data obtained from an ecosystem model to study the predicted SAD\nin detail, resolving features which can distinguish between models but which\nare poorly seen in field data.

A closed cell of rectangular cross-section is partially\nfilled with glass beads and a constant fluid flux $Q$ flows through the cell.\nThe refractive indices of the fluid and the glass beads are matched and the\ncell is illuminated with a laser sheet, allowing us to image individual beads.\nThe bed erodes to a rest height $h_r$ which depends on $Q$. The Shields\nthreshold criterion assumes that the non-dimensional ratio $\\theta$ of the\nviscous stress on the bed to the hydrostatic pressure difference across a grain\nis sufficient to predict the granular flux.
