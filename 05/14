One of the possible applications of this technique is soil moisture\nmonitoring. The retrieval of soil moisture with GNSS-R systems is based on the\nvariability of the ground dielectric properties associated to soil moisture.\nHigher concentrations of water in the soil yield a higher dielectric constant\nand reflectivity, which incurs in signals that reflect from the Earth surface\nwith higher peak power. Previous investigations have demonstrated the\ncapability of GPS bistatic scatterometers to obtain high enough signal to noise\nratios in order to sense small changes in surface reflectivity. Furthermore,\nthese systems present some advantages with respect to others currently used to\nretrieve soil moisture. Upcoming satellite navigation systems, such as the\nEuropean Galileo, will represent an excellent source of opportunity for soil\nmoisture remote sensing for various reasons. First, the existence of pilot\nsignals will provide the possibility to extend coherent integration times,\nwhich will contribute to the increase of received signals SNR. In addition, the\navailability of Galileo L1 and L5 signals will allow the multi-spectral\nanalysis of the reflected signals and the development of inversion models which\nwill be able to account more precisely for adverse effects, such as surface\nroughness and vegetation canopy.

It is shown that the calculated cross sections are sensitive to\nthe couplings to the $2^+$ and $3^-$ excitation channels even at low energies,\nwhere these channels are closed. The sensitivity to the ion-ion potential is\ninvestigated by applying a conventional Woods-Saxon potential and the\nM3Y+repulsion potential, consisting of the M3Y double-folding potential and a\nrepulsive term that simulates the effect of the nuclear incompressibility. The\nbest overall fit to the data is obtained with a M3Y+repulsion potential which\nproduces a shallow potential in the entrance channel. The stepwise increase in\nmeasured fusion cross sections at high energies is also consistent with such a\nshallow potential. The steps are correlated with overcoming the barriers for\nthe angular momenta $L$ = 12, 14, 16, and 18. To improve the fit to the\nlow-energy data requires a shallower potential and this causes a even stronger\nhindrance of fusion at low energies.

In the same\nperiod He I lines become the most prominent spectral features. SN 2008ax\ndisplays the ordinary spectral evolution of a type IIb supernova. A stringent\npre-discovery limit constrains the time of the shock breakout of SN 2008ax to\nwithin only a few hours. Its light curve, which peaks in the B band about 20\ndays after the explosion, strongly resembles that of other He-rich\ncore-collapse supernovae. The observed evolution of SN 2008ax is consistent\nwith the explosion of a young Wolf-Rayet (of WNL type) star, which had retained\na thin, low-mass shell of its original H envelope. The overall characteristics\nof SN 2008ax are reminiscent of those of SN 1993J, except for a likely smaller\nH mass. This may account for the findings that the progenitor of SN 2008ax was\na WNL star and not a K supergiant as in the case of SN 1993J, that a prominent\nearly-time peak is missing in the light curve of SN 2008ax, and that Halpha is\nobserved at higher velocities in SN 2008ax than in SN 1993J.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2008 19:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2008 16:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The model has been\ncalibrated in order to reproduce observational correlations between BH mass and\nmass, velocity dispersion, and absolute magnitudes of the galaxy bulge.

We discuss and defend the idea that the\nphysical basis of the time concept is necessarily related to physical processes\nwhich could conceivably take place among the material constituents available in\nthe universe. It is common practice to link the concept of cosmic time with a\nspace-time metric set up to describe the universe at large scales, and then\ndefine a cosmic time $t$ as what is measured by a comoving standard clock. We\nwant to examine, however, the physical basis for setting up a comoving\nreference frame and, in particular, what could be meant by a standard clock.\nFor this purpose we introduce the concept of a `core' of a clock (which, for a\nstandard clock in cosmology, is a scale-setting physical process) and we ask if\nsuch a core can--in principle--be found in the available physics contemplated\nin the various `stages' of the early universe. We find that a first problem\narises above the quark-gluon phase transition (which roughly occurs when the\ncosmological model is extrapolated back to $\\sim 10^{-5}$ seconds) where there\nmight be no bound systems left, and the concept of a physical length scale to a\ncertain extent disappears. A more serious problem appears above the electroweak\nphase transition believed to occur at $\\sim 10^{-11}$ seconds. At this point\nthe property of mass (almost) disappears and it becomes difficult to identify a\nphysical basis for concepts like length scale, energy scale and temperature --\nwhich are all intimately linked to the concept of time in modern cosmology.\nThis situation suggests that the concept of a time scale in `very early'\nuniverse cosmology lacks a physical basis or, at least, that the time scale\nwill have to be based on speculative new physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2008 22:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-23"}

The gamma-ray satellite AGILE\ndetected this source first in late July, and then in November-December 2007. In\nthis letter we present the multifrequency data collected by the WEBT and\ncollaborators during the second AGILE observing period, complemented by a few\ncontemporaneous data from UVOT onboard the Swift satellite. The aim is to trace\nin detail the behaviour of the synchrotron emission from the blazar jet, and to\ninvestigate the contribution from the thermal emission component. Optical data\nfrom about twenty telescopes have been homogeneously calibrated and carefully\nassembled to construct an R-band light curve containing about 1340 data points\nin 42 days. This extremely well-sampled optical light curve allows us to follow\nthe dramatic flux variability of the source in detail. In addition, we show\nradio-to-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at different epochs, which\nrepresent different brightness levels. In the considered period, the source\nvaried by 2.6 mag in a couple of weeks in the R band. Many episodes of fast\n(i.e. intranight) variability were observed, most notably on December 12, when\na flux increase of about 1.1 mag in 1.5 hours was detected, followed by a steep\ndecrease of about 1.2 mag in 1 hour. The contribution by the thermal component\nis difficult to assess, due to the uncertainties in the Galactic, and possibly\nalso intrinsic, extinction in the UV band. However, polynomial fitting of\nradio-to-UV SEDs reveals an increasing spectral bending going towards fainter\nstates, suggesting a UV excess likely due to the thermal emission from the\naccretion disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2008 06:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We show for the first time that an\nimpulsively generated propagating disturbance has similar kinematics in all\nfour EUVI passbands (304, 171, 195, and 284 A). In the 304 A passband the\ndisturbance shows a velocity peak of 238+/-20 kms-1 within ~28 minutes of its\nlaunch, varying in acceleration from 76 ms-2 to -102 ms-2. This passband\ncontains a strong contribution from a Si XI line (303.32 A) with a peak\nformation temperature of ~1.6 MK.

Comparable velocities and accelerations\nare found in the coronal 195 A passband, while lower values are found in the\nlower cadence 284 A passband.

Thus we are able to pose incomparability as a good detector of some\nnon-physical operations. In the next part, we provide a new class of\nmultipartite bound entanglement in mixed state level. The class of states are\nactivable bound entangled. There are exactly four orthogonal activable bound\nentangled states in any even number of qubit system. They have some interesting\nfeatures like Bell correlation, permutation symmetry, local Pauli connection,\nnon-compatibility, etc. Apart from those properties, the class of bound\nentangled states have the remarkable feature of local indistinguishability in\nquantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2008 13:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-15"}

In its spatial version, agents do not play with every other\nbut, instead, interact only with their neighbors, thus mimicking the existing\nof a social or contact network that defines who interacts with whom. In this\nwork, we explore evolutionary, spatial PD systems consisting of two types of\nagents, each with a certain update (reproduction, learning) rule. We\ninvestigate two different scenarios: in the first case, update rules remain\nfixed for the entire evolution of the system; in the second case, agents update\nboth strategy and update rule in every generation. We show that in a well-mixed\npopulation the evolutionary outcome is always full defection. We subsequently\nfocus on two-strategy competition with nearest-neighbor interactions on the\ncontact network and synchronized update of strategies. Our results show that,\nfor an important range of the parameters of the game, the final state of the\nsystem is largely different from that arising from the usual setup of a single,\nfixed dynamical rule. Furthermore, the results are also very different if\nupdate rules are fixed or evolve with the strategies. In these respect, we have\nstudied representative update rules, finding that some of them may become\nextinct while others prevail. We describe the new and rich variety of final\noutcomes that arise from this co-evolutionary dynamics.

One\npossible such extension is the diffusion limit of Nelson, but this is\nproblematic in that the discrete-time GARCH model and its continuous-time\ndiffusion limit are not statistically equivalent. As an alternative,\nKl\\\"{u}ppelberg et al. recently introduced a continuous-time version of the\nGARCH (the `COGARCH' process) which is constructed directly from a background\ndriving L\\'{e}vy process. The present paper shows how to fit this model to\nirregularly spaced time series data using discrete-time GARCH methodology, by\napproximating the COGARCH with an embedded sequence of discrete-time GARCH\nseries which converges to the continuous-time model in a strong sense (in\nprobability, in the Skorokhod metric), as the discrete approximating grid grows\nfiner. This property is also especially useful in certain other applications,\nsuch as options pricing. The way is then open to using, for the COGARCH,\nsimilar statistical techniques to those already worked out for GARCH models and\nto illustrate this, an empirical investigation using stock index data is\ncarried out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2008 15:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Most of these plates were taken with the Mount Wilson 60\" and 100\"\ntelescopes, but 7 of the plates (now at the Harvard College Observatory) were\ntaken with the 12\" and 16\" Metcalf doublets at Oak Ridge.

The\nlater darkening trend from 1954 to the 1980s has been explained by changing\nviewing geometry (as more of the darker northern hemisphere comes into view).\nThus, we now have strong evidence for albedo changes on the surface of Pluto,\nand these are most easily explained by the systematic sublimation of frosts\nfrom the sunward pole that led to a drop in the mean surface albedo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2008 15:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
