This is a familiar viewpoint for workers in quantum\ncomputation, which encompasses classical computation as a special case. Here\nthis viewpoint is extended to mechanics, where classical dynamics has\ntraditionally been viewed as a macroscopic approximation of quantum behavior,\nnot as a special case.\n  When a classical dynamics is recast as a special case of quantum dynamics,\nthe quantum description can be interpreted classically. For example, sometimes\nextra information is added to the classical state in order to construct the\nquantum description. This extra information is then eliminated by representing\nit in a superposition as if it were unknown information about a classical\nstatistical ensemble. This usage of superposition leads to the appearance of\nFermions in the quantum description of classical lattice-gas dynamics and turns\ncontinuous-space descriptions of finite-state systems into illustrations of\nclassical sampling theory.\n  A direct mapping of classical systems onto quantum systems also allows us to\ndetermine the minimum possible energy scale for a classical dynamics, based on\na localized rate of state change. We use a partitioning description of dynamics\nto define locality, and discuss the ideal energy of two model systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2008 19:52:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2008 19:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-01"}

In this\npaper, we propose a new mechanism by which the massive BBH can naturally\ncoalesce within a Hubble time. We study the evolution of the BBH with triple\ndisks which are composed of an accretion disk around each black hole and one\ncircumbinary disk surrounding them. While the circumbinary disk removes the\norbital angular momentum of the BBH via the binary-disk resonant interaction,\nthe mass transfer from the circumbinary disk to each black hole adds some\nfraction of its angular momentum to the orbital angular momentum of the BBH. We\nfind that there is a critical value of the mass-transfer rate where the\nextraction of the orbital angular momentum from the BBH is balanced with the\naddition of the orbital angular momentum to the BBH. The semi-major axis of the\nBBH decays with time whereas the orbital eccentricity of the BBH grows with\ntime, if the mass transfer rate is smaller than the critical one, and vice\nversa. Its evolutionary timescale is characterized by the product of the\nviscous timescale of the circumbinary disk and the ratio of the total black\nhole mass to the mass of the circumbinary disk. Since a minimum value of the\ncritical mass-transfer rate is larger than the Eddington accretion rate of\nmassive black holes with masses in the 10^{6}M_{sun} to $10^{9}M_{sun} range,\nit is promising that the critical mass-transfer rate is larger than the mass\ntransfer rate. Most of massive BBHs, therefore, enable to merge within a Hubble\ntime by the proposed mechanism, which helps to solve the final parsec problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2008 19:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 11:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This\nnon-uniform stress, which arises from the way graphene is prepared by pressing\nor rubbing bulk graphite against another surface, should be taken into account\nin future studies on electronic and mechanical properties of graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2008 16:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

However, without a rigorous\nunderstanding of the processes which regulate the Lya escape fraction, physical\ninterpretations of high-z observations remain questionable. We examine six\nnearby star-forming galaxies to disentangle the role of the dust from other\nparameters such as gas kinematics, geometry and ISM morphology in the\nobscuration of Ly-alpha. Thereby we aim to understand the Ly-a escape physics\nand infer the implications for high-redshift studies. We use HST/ACS to produce\ncontinuum-subtracted Lya maps, and ground-based observations (ESO/NTT and NOT)\nto map the Halpha emission and the extinction E(B-V) in the gas phase derived\nfrom the Balmer decrement Halpha/Hbeta. When large outflows are present, the\nLya emission appears not to correlate with the dust content, confirming the\nrole of the HI kinematics in the escape of Lya photons. In the case of a dense,\nstatic HI covering, we observe a damped absorption with a declining\nrelationship between Lya and E(B-V). We found that the Lya escape fraction does\nnot exceed 10% in all our galaxies and is mostly about 3% or below. Finally,\nbecause of the radiative transfer complexity of the Lya line, star formation\nrate based on Lya luminosity is underestimated with respect to that derived\nfrom UV luminosity. The failure of simple dust correction to recover the\nintrinsic Lya/Ha ratio or the total star formation rate should prompt us to be\nmore cautious when interpreting high-z observations and related properties,\nsuch as SFRs based on Lya alone. To this end we propose a more realistic\ncalibration for SFR(Lya) which accounts for dust attenuation and resonant\nscattering effects via the Lya escape fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2008 18:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-15"}

We start with the different representations of subspaces in\nthe projective space. These representations involve matrices in reduced row\nechelon form, associated binary vectors, and Ferrers diagrams. Based on these\nrepresentations, we provide a new formula for the computation of the distance\nbetween any two subspaces in the projective space.

A good choice is often hard\nto achieve especially for high-dimensional integration problems. Nonparametric\nestimation of the optimal importance sampling distribution (known as\nnonparametric importance sampling) is a reasonable alternative to parametric\napproaches.In this article nonparametric variants of both the self-normalized\nand the unnormalized importance sampling estimator are proposed and\ninvestigated. A common critique on nonparametric importance sampling is the\nincreased computational burden compared to parametric methods. We solve this\nproblem to a large degree by utilizing the linear blend frequency polygon\nestimator instead of a kernel estimator. Mean square error convergence\nproperties are investigated leading to recommendations for the efficient\napplication of nonparametric importance sampling. Particularly, we show that\nnonparametric importance sampling asymptotically attains optimal importance\nsampling variance. The efficiency of nonparametric importance sampling\nalgorithms heavily relies on the computational efficiency of the employed\nnonparametric estimator. The linear blend frequency polygon outperforms kernel\nestimators in terms of certain criteria such as efficient sampling and\nevaluation. Furthermore, it is compatible with the inversion method for sample\ngeneration. This allows to combine our algorithms with other variance reduction\ntechniques such as stratified sampling. Empirical evidence for the usefulness\nof the suggested algorithms is obtained by means of three benchmark integration\nproblems. As an application we estimate the distribution of the queue length of\na spam filter queueing system based on real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2008 07:46:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2008 10:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-10"}

There are three key ingredients in the Mike-Farmer\n(MF) model: the long memory of order signs characterized by the Hurst index\n$H_s$, the distribution of relative order prices $x$ in reference to the same\nbest price described by a Student distribution (or Tsallis' $q$-Gaussian), and\nthe dynamics of order cancelation. They showed that different values of the\nHurst index $H_s$ and the freedom degree $\\alpha_x$ of the Student distribution\ncan always produce power-law tails in the return distribution $f(r)$ with\ndifferent tail exponent $\\alpha_r$. In this paper, we study the origin of the\npower-law tails of the return distribution $f(r)$ in the MF model, based on\nextensive simulations with different combinations of the left part $f_L(x)$ for\n$x<0$ and the right part $f_R(x)$ for $x>0$ of $f(x)$.

To view the\nactive nucleus directly in the optical, the central molecular gas structure can\neither be a low-inclined disk or torus but not too low to be less massive than\nthe mass of the host galaxy itself, be a highly-inclined thin disk or clumpy\nand thick torus, or be an inner part of the galactic disk. The R21 value of\n~1.9 of the central molecular gas component, which is significantly higher than\nthe value found at the molecular gas ring, indicates that the activity of the\nSeyfert nucleus may have a significant influence on the conditions of the\nmolecular gas in the central component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2008 14:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

All data consist of 3.6 cm continuum emission and were taken with the\nVery Large Array in its highest angular resolution A configuration. We confirm\nthe large proper motions of the BN object, the radio source I (GMR I) and the\nradio counterpart of the infrared source n (Orion-n), with values from 15 to 26\nkm/s. The three sources are receding from a point between them from where they\nseem to have been ejected about 500 years ago, probably via the disintegration\nof a multiple stellar system. We present simulations of very compact stellar\ngroups that provide a plausible dynamical scenario for the observations. The\nradio source Orion-n appeared as a double in the first three epochs, but as\nsingle in 2006. We discuss this morphological change. The fourth source in the\nregion, GMR D, shows no statistically significant proper motions. We also\npresent new, accurate relative astrometry between BN and radio source I that\nrestrict possible dynamical scenarios for the region. During the 2006\nobservations, the radio source GMR A, located about 1' to the NW of the BN/KL\nregion, exhibited an increase in its flux density of a factor of ~3.5 over a\ntimescale of one hour.

In particular, we improved the treatment of the radiative transfer\nproblem in order to accommodate larger non-local contributions occurring with\nsmaller opacities.

The dynamical models for LMC and SMC metallicity result in mass-loss\nrates of the same order of magnitude as the solar metallicity models which is\nin this basic approach in agreement with observations. The hydrodynamical\nproperties like e.g. the outflow velocity differ (for fixed C/O abundance\nratio) noticeably, though.
