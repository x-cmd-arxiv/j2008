In\nmodels with relatively small mass splittings between the dark matter candidate\nand the rest of the (colored) spectrum, the collider sensitivity is diminished,\nbut direct detection rates are enhanced. UEDs provide a natural framework for\nsuch mass degeneracies. We consider both 5-dimensional and 6-dimensional\nnon-minimal UED models, and discuss the detection prospects for various KK dark\nmatter candidates: the KK photon $\\gamma_1$, the KK $Z$-boson $Z_1$, the KK\nHiggs boson $H_1$ and the spinless KK photon $\\gamma_H$. We combine collider\nlimits such as electroweak precision data and expected LHC reach, with\ncosmological constraints from WMAP, and the sensitivity of current or planned\ndirect detection experiments. Allowing for general mass splittings, we show\nthat neither colliders, nor direct detection experiments by themselves can\nexplore all of the relevant KK dark matter parameter space. Nevertheless, they\nprobe different parameter space regions, and the combination of the two types\nof constraints can be quite powerful. For example, in the case of $\\gamma_1$ in\n5D UEDs the relevant parameter space will be almost completely covered by the\ncombined LHC and direct detection sensitivities expected in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 16:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The effects of phase holography\nartifacts on quantum-state generation are quantified and a prescription for\navoiding these artifacts by preconditioning the hologram function is presented.\nPractical effects associated with spatially isolating the first-order\ndiffracted field are also quantified and a demonstration utilizing a liquid\ncrystal SLM is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 17:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The Jean's criterion is not sufficient for\nstability always. Rather, the waves will suffer instability unless their wave\nlength (frequency) is less (greater) than certain critical values. Otherwise,\nthose will smoothly propagate outward. Out of different scenarioes depending on\nthe direction of the magnetic field, its gradient, rotation and wave\npropagation three important Special Cases have been discussed and different\nstability criteria have been derived.\n  Finally, using the above theory we have obtained the stability/instability\ncriteria for the waves moving parallel and perpendicular to the galactic plane\nin the Core and Periphery of the Central Region of Galaxy (C.R.G.) due to the\ncoupled action of Rotation and Non-Uniform Magnetic field.

After reviewing the main ideas\nbehind this calculation, we use a Fokker-Planck equation derived by BPS to\ncompute the electron-ion energy partitioning of a charged particle traversing a\nplasma. The motivation for this application is ignition for inertial\nconfinement fusion -- more energy delivered to the ions means a better chance\nof ignition, and conversely. It is therefore important to calculate the\nfractional energy loss to electrons and ions as accurately as possible, as this\ncould have implications for the Laser Megajoule (LMJ) facility in France and\nthe National Ignition Facility (NIF) in the United States. The traditional\nmethod by which one calculates the electron-ion energy splitting of a charged\nparticle traversing a plasma involves integrating the stopping power dE/dx.\nHowever, as the charged particle slows down and becomes thermalized into the\nbackground plasma, this method of calculating the electron-ion energy splitting\nbreaks down. As a result, the method suffers a systematic error of order T/E0,\nwhere T is the plasma temperature and E0 is the initial energy of the charged\nparticle. In the case of DT fusion, for example, this can lead to uncertainties\nas high as 10% or so.

We calculate the\ndynamics near the outer edge of the disk, which contains the majority of the\nmass and sets the accretion rate onto the central black hole. This allows us to\nfollow the evolution over much longer timescales than current hydrodynamic\nsimulations. At late times the disk becomes advective and its properties\nasymptote to self-similar solutions with accretion rate dM/dt ~ t^(-4/3)\n(neglecting outflows). This late-time accretion can in principle provide\nsufficient energy to power the late-time activity observed from some\nshort-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, because outflows during the\nadvective phase unbind the majority of the remaining mass, it is difficult for\nthe remnant disk alone to produce significant accretion power well beyond the\nonset of the advective phase. Unless the viscosity is quite low (alpha ~1e-3),\nthis occurs before the start of observed flaring at ~ 30 s; continued mass\ninflow thus appears required to explain the late-time activity from short GRBs.\nWe show that the composition of the disk freezes-out relatively neutron-rich\n(electron fraction Ye ~ 0.3). Roughly 1e-2 Msun of this neutron-rich material\nis ejected by winds at late times.

Towards the goal of a\nlow-complexity implementation, a structured precoder is proposed, where the\nprecoder matrix evolves fairly slowly at a rate comparable with the statistical\nevolution of the channel. Here, the eigenvectors of the precoder matrix\ncorrespond to the dominant eigenvectors of the transmit covariance matrix,\nwhereas the power allocation across the modes is fixed, known at both the ends,\nand is of low-complexity. A particular case of the proposed scheme (semiunitary\nprecoding), where the spatial modes are excited with equal power, is shown to\nbe near-optimal in matched channels. A matched channel is one where the\ndominant eigenvalues of the transmit covariance matrix are well-conditioned and\ntheir number equals the number of independent data-streams, and the receive\ncovariance matrix is also well-conditioned. In mismatched channels, where the\nabove conditions are not met, it is shown that the loss in performance with\nsemiunitary precoding when compared with a perfect channel information\nbenchmark is substantial. This loss needs to be mitigated via limited feedback\ntechniques that provide partial channel information to the transmitter. More\nimportantly, we develop matching metrics that capture the degree of matching of\na channel to the precoder structure continuously, and allow ordering two matrix\nchannels in terms of their mutual information or error probability performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 20:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

Comparison of the low\ntemperature electronic spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_1 at 9.7 and 240 GHz\nshows that it is 250 times faster at 240 GHz than at X-band. On the other hand,\nthe spin-spin relaxation rate 1/T_2 appears largely frequency independent and\nis very likely related to the superhyperfine (SHF) coupling of the Cr^5+\nelectron with the surrounding potassium and niobium nuclei. This coupling was\ninvestigated by HYSCORE at 9.7 GHz and pulsed Mims ENDOR at 240 GHz. The high\nfrequency and field enabled us to unambiguously measure the hyperfine and\nquadrupole couplings of the 39K in spite of its small magnetic moment. We find\nthat the largest 39K SHF coupling is positive, with 0.522 MHz and 0.20 MHz as\nits isotropic and dipolar parts respectively. 93Nb ENDOR was dominantly due to\nits quadrapolar interaction, with a coupling of about 0.8 MHz, and a SHF\ncoupling of about 0.08 MHz. The significance of these data to spin qubit\nstudies is pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 21:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-01"}

We derive the Hamiltonian of the combined system\nand find the coupling between the CPB and the fluctuators as well as a coupling\nbetween the fluctuators that is due to the CPB. We then find the energy levels\nand transition spectrum numerically for the case of a CPB coupled to a single\ncharge fluctuator, where we treat the fluctuator as a two-level system that\ntunnels between two sites. The resulting spectra show the usual transition\nspectra of the CPB plus distinctive transitions due to excitation of the\nfluctuator; the fluctuator transitions are 2-e periodic and resemble saw-tooth\npatterns when plotted as a function of the gate voltage applied to the box. The\ncombined CPB fluctuator spectra show small second-order avoided crossings with\na size that depends on the gate voltage. Finally, we discuss how the\nmicroscopic parameters of the model, such as the charge times the hopping\ndistance, the tunneling rate between the hopping sites, and the energy\ndifference between the hopping sites, can be extracted from CPB spectra, and\nwhy this yields more information than can be found from similar spectra from\nphase qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 20:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-30"}

Any X-ray or ultraviolet line emission from hotter stars must be due either\nto a different mechanism or to an unresolved, active, binary companion. Due to\ntheir poor spatial resolution, X-ray instruments have been especially\nsusceptible to source confusion. At wavelengths longward of 1216 Angstroms, the\nnear ultraviolet spectra of stars hotter than this putative dividing line are\ndominated by photospheric continuum. We have used FUSE to obtain spectra of the\nsubcoronal O VI emission lines, which lie at a wavelength where the\nphotospheric continuum of the mid- and early-A stars is relatively weak. We\nobserved 14 stars spanning a range in T_eff from 7720 to 10,000 K. Eleven of\nthe 14 stars showed O VI emission lines, including 6 of the 8 targets with\nT_eff > 8300 K. At face value, this suggests that activity does not fall off\nwith increasing temperature. However, the emission lines are narrower than\nexpected from the projected rotational velocities of these rapidly-rotating\nstars, suggesting that the emission could come from unresolved late-type\ncompanions. Furthermore, the strength of the O VI emission is consistent with\nthat expected from an unseen active K or M dwarf binary companinon, and the\nhigh x-ray to far uv luminosity ratios observed indicate that this must be the\ncase. Our results are therefore consistent with earlier studies that have shown\na rapid drop-off in activity at the radiative/convective boundary expected at\nT_eff about 8300 K, in agreement with conventional stellar structure models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2008 02:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Suppose that we observe m entries\nselected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and\nrecover the entries that we have not seen?\n  We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what\nappears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of\nsampled entries obeys m >= C n^{1.2} r log n for some positive numerical\nconstant C, then with very high probability, most n by n matrices of rank r can\nbe perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This\nprogram finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The\ncondition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one\nreplaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of\nthe rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well.

The flux variability detected in image A of RX J1131-1231 is of\nparticular interest because of its high amplitude (a factor of ~ 20). We\ninterpret it as arising from microlensing since the variability is uncorrelated\nwith that of the other images and the X-ray flux ratios show larger changes\nthan the optical as we would expect for microlensing of the more compact X-ray\nemission regions. The differences between the X-ray and optical flux ratios of\nHE 1104-1805 are less dramatic, but there is no significant soft X-ray or dust\nabsorption, implying the presence of X-ray microlensing in this system as well.\nCombining the X-ray data with the optical light curves we find that the X-ray\nemitting region of HE 1104-1805 is compact with a half-light radius ~ 6 r_g,\nwhere the gravitational radius is r_g = 3.6 x 10^14 cm, thus placing\nsignificant constraints on AGN corona models.

At the $M_5$\nedge in the uniform helical phase, the calculated spectra of the absorption\ncoefficient, the RXS intensities at the first and second satellite spots\ncapture the properties the experimental data possess, such as the spectral\nshapes and the peak positions.

It is found that the dimensionless reduced decay width for a\nparticular $(b\\bar{c})$-quarkonium state, $\\bar\\Gamma_{n}=\\Gamma_{n}\n/\\Gamma_{t\\to W^{+}+b}$, is very sensitive to the $c$-quark mass, while the\nuncertainties from the $b$-quark and $t$-quark masses are small, where $n$\nstands for the eight $(b\\bar{c})$-quarkonium states up to ${\\cal O}(v^4)$:\n$|(b\\bar{c})(^1S_0)_1>$, $|(b\\bar{c})(^3S_1)_1>$, $|(b\\bar{c})(^1P_1)_1>$,\n$|(b\\bar{c})(^3P_J)_1>$ (with $J=(1,2,3)$), $|(b\\bar{c})(^1S_0)_{8}g>$ and\n$|(b\\bar{c})(^3S_1)_{8}g>$ respectively.

In this letter, we argue (i) the requirement for a\ncandidate approach to go beyond $S_{_{\\rm BH}}$ and provide generic subleading\ncorrections, and (ii) the importance to {\\it disentangle} and identify the\ndegrees of freedom leading to $S_{_{\\rm BH}}$ and its subleading corrections.\nUsing the approach of entanglement of modes across the horizon, we show that\nthe microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to $S_{_{\\rm BH}}$ and subleading\ncorrections are different. We further show, using microcanonical and canonical\nensemble approaches, that the quantum entanglement predicts generic power-law\ncorrections to $S_{_{\\rm BH}}$ and that the corrections can be identified with\nthe kinematical properties of the event-horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2008 12:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

This model is closely related to the\nmembrane-embedded F$_0$ motor of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, which\nconverts the energy of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of protons\ninto mechanical motion of the rotor. It is shown that the Coulomb coupling\nbetween the negative charge of the empty rotor site and the positive stator\ncharge, located near the periplasmic proton-conducting channel (proton source),\nplays a dominant role in the torque-generating process. When approaching the\nsource outlet, the rotor site has a proton energy level higher than the energy\nlevel of the site, located near the cytoplasmic channel (proton drain). In the\nfirst stage of this torque-generating process, the energy of the\nelectrochemical potential is converted into potential energy of the\nproton-binding sites on the rotor. Afterwards, the tangential component of the\nCoulomb force produces a mechanical torque. We demonstrate that, at low\ntemperatures, the loaded motor works in the shuttling regime where the energy\nof the electrochemical potential is consumed without producing any\nunidirectional rotation. The motor switches to the torque-generating regime at\nhigh temperatures, when the Brownian ratchet mechanism turns on. In the\npresence of a significant external torque, created by ATP hydrolysis, the\nsystem operates as a proton pump, which translocates protons against the\ntransmembrane potential gradient.

We first discuss the general\nconditions under which the time evolution of a cold collisionless\nself-gravitating fluid is self-similar, and show that symmetry is not necessary\nfor self-similarity. When spherical symmetry is imposed, the model is the same\nas described by Fillmore and Goldreich, and by Bertschinger, twenty-three years\nago. The spherically symmetric model depends on one dimensionless parameter\n$\\epsilon$ and two dimensionful parameters. We set $\\epsilon$ = 0.3, a value\nconsistent with the slope of the power spectrum of density perturbations on\ngalactic scales. The dimensionful parameters are determined by the Galactic\nrotation velocity (220 km/s) at the position of the Sun and by the age of the\nGalaxy (13.7 Gyr). The properties of the outer caustics are derived in the\nspherically symmetric model. The structure of the inner halo depends on the\nangular momentum distribution of the dark matter particles. We assume that\ndistribution to be axial and reflection symmetric, and dominated by net overall\nrotation. The inner caustics are rings whose radii are determined in terms of a\nsingle additional parameter $j_{\\rm max}$. We summarize the observational\nevidence in support of the model.
