Some 1,253 white dwarfs with a detached low-mass main-sequence\ncompanion are identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey but none of these is\nobserved to show evidence for Zeeman splitting of hydrogen lines associated\nwith a magnetic field in excess of 1MG. If such high magnetic fields on white\ndwarfs result from the isolated evolution of a single star then there should be\nthe same fraction of high field white dwarfs among this SDSS binary sample as\namong single stars. Thus we deduce that the origin of such high magnetic fields\nmust be intimately tied to the formation of cataclysmic variables.

We\npropose that the smaller the orbital separation at the end of the common\nenvelope phase, the stronger the magnetic field.

Thus all highly magnetic\nwhite dwarfs, be they single stars or the components of MCVs, have a binary\norigin. This hypothesis also accounts for the relative dearth of single white\ndwarfs with fields of 10,000 - 1,000,000G. Such intermediate-field white dwarfs\nare found preferentially in cataclysmic variables. In addition the bias towards\nhigher masses for highly magnetic white dwarfs is expected if a fraction of\nthese form when two degenerate cores merge in a common envelope.

We show that the\nfinite size of stars can dramatically change the self-lensing eventrate and\n(less dramatically) also the halo lensing eventrate, if events are as bright as\nWeCAPP-GL1. The brightness of the brightest events mostly depends on the source\nsizes and fluxes and on the distance distribution of sources and lenses and\ntherefore can be used as a sensitive discriminator between halo-lensing and\nself-lensing events, provided the stellar population mix of source stars is\nknown well enough. Using a realistic model for the 3D-light distribution,\nstellar population and extinction of M31, we show that an event like WeCAPP-GL1\nis very unlikely to be caused by self-lensing. In the entire WeCAPP-field\n($17.2'\\times 17.2'$ centered on the bulge) we expect only one self-lensing\nevent every 49 years with the approximate parameters of WeCAPP-GL1 (time-scale\n1-3d, $R$ flux-excess <19.0 mag).

The data indicate\nthat the prompt optical and gamma-ray photons were produced at the same\nlocation but by different radiation processes: synchrotron and synchrotron\nself-Compton, respectively. The burst emission was produced at a distance of\n10^{16.5} cm from the center of explosion by an ultra-relativistic source\nmoving at Lorentz factor of ~500. A straightforward inference is that about 10\ntimes more energy must have been radiated at tens of GeV than that released at\n~1 MeV. Assuming that the GRB outflow was baryonic and that the gamma-ray\nsource was shock-heated plasma, the collimation-corrected kinetic energy of the\njet powering GRB 080319B was larger than 10^{52.3} erg.

Recent XMM-Newton observations of\nthe SMC cover three known SNRs (DEM S5, SNR B0050-72.8, and SNR B0058-71.8),\nwhich are poorly studied and are X-ray faint. We used new multi-frequency\nradio-continuum surveys and new optical observations at Ha, [SII], and [OIII]\nwavelengths, in combination with the X-ray data, to investigate their\nproperties and to search for new SNRs in the SMC. We used X-ray source\nselection criteria and found one SMC object with typical SNR characteristics\n(HFPK 334), that was initially detected by ROSAT. We analysed the X-ray spectra\nand present multi-wavelength morphological studies of the three SNRs and the\nnew candidate. Using a non-equilibrium ionisation collisional plasma model, we\nfind temperatures kT around 0.18 keV for the three known remnants and 0.69 keV\nfor the candidate. The low temperature, low surface brightness, and large\nextent of the three remnants indicates relatively large ages. The emission from\nthe new candidate (HFPK 334) is more centrally peaked and the higher\ntemperature suggests a younger remnant. Our new radio images indicate that a\npulsar wind nebulae (PWN) is possibly associated with this object. The SNRs\nknown in the SMC show a variety of morphological structures that are relatively\nuncorrelated in the different wavelength bands, probably caused by the\ndifferent conditions in the surrounding medium with which the remnant\ninteracts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2008 00:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-23"}

First, we set up\nan effective lattice fermion model for the manganese 3d bands and derive\nparameters of this model entirely from first-principles electronic structure\ncalculations. Then, we solve this model in terms of the mean-field Hartree-Fock\nmethod and derive parameters of interatomic magnetic interactions between Mn\nions. We argue that although nearest-neighbor interactions favors the\nferromagnetism, they compete with longer-range antiferromagnetic (AFM)\ninteractions, the existence of which is directly related with the peculiar\ngeometry of the orbital ordering pattern realized in BiMnO$_3$ below 474 K.\nThese AFM interactions favor an AFM phase, which breaks the inversion symmetry.\nThe formation of the AFM phase is assisted by the orbital degrees of freedom,\nwhich tend to adjust the nearest-neighbor magnetic interactions in the\ndirection, which further stabilizes this phase. We propose that the\nmultiferroelectric behavior, observed in BiMnO$_3$, may be related with the\nemergence of the AFM phase under certain conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2008 07:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-11"}

The method is adaptive on the source plane, where a Delaunay\ntessellation is defined according to the lens mapping of a regular grid onto\nthe source plane. The Bayesian penalty function allows us to recover the best\nnon-linear potential-model parameters and/or a grid-based potential correction\nand to objectively quantify the level of regularization for both the source and\nthe potential. In addition, we implement a Nested-Sampling technique to\nquantify the errors on all non-linear mass model parameters -- ... -- and allow\nan objective ranking of different potential models in terms of the marginalized\nevidence.

The quantum\nconstraints are solved via group averaging techniques and, analogous to the\ncase of spatial geometry in LQG, the smooth (flat) spacetime geometry is\nreplaced by a discrete quantum structure. An overcomplete set of Dirac\nobservables, consisting of (a) (exponentials of) the standard free scalar field\ncreation- annihilation modes and (b) canonical transformations corresponding to\nconformal isometries, are represented as operators on the physical Hilbert\nspace. None of these constructions suffer from any of the `triangulation'\ndependent choices which arise in treatments of LQG. In contrast to the standard\nFock quantization, the non- Fock nature of the representation ensures that the\nalgebra of conformal isometries as well as that of spacetime diffeomorphisms\nare represented in an anomaly free manner. Semiclassical states can be analysed\nat the gauge invariant level. It is shown that `physical weaves' necessarily\nunderly such states and that such states display semiclassicality with respect\nto, at most, a countable subset of the (uncountably large) set of observables\nof type (a). The model thus offers a fertile testing ground for proposed\ndefinitions of quantum dynamics as well as semiclassical states in LQG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2008 11:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We fit the spectra of 46\nobjects with PEGASE.HR synthetic spectra to estimate the ages, metallicities,\nand velocity dispersions. We computed values of $\\alpha$/Fe abundance ratios\nfrom the measurements of Lick indices. High-precision estimates of stellar\npopulation properties have been obtained for a large sample of faint galaxies\nin a cluster, allowing for the extension of relations between stellar\npopulations and internal kinematics to the low-velocity dispersion regime. We\nhave revealed a peculiar population of elliptical galaxies in the core of the\ncluster, resembling massive early-type galaxies by their stellar population\nproperties and velocity dispersions, but having luminosities of about 2 mag\nfainter. External mechanisms of gas removal (ram pressure stripping and\ngravitational harassment) are more likely to have occurred than internal\nmechanisms such as supernova-driven winds. The violent tidal stripping of\nintermediate-luminosity, early-type galaxies in the cluster core can explain\nthe properties of the peculiar elliptical galaxies surrounding the cD galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2008 12:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Because accurate parameter\nestimation is a non-analytic and computationally intensive problem, it is often\nuseful to have analytic approximations for the parameters as well as their\nuncertainties and covariances. Here we give such formulas, for the case of an\nexoplanet transiting a star with a uniform brightness distribution. We also\nassess the advantages of some relatively uncorrelated parameter sets for\nfitting actual data. When limb darkening is significant, our parameter sets are\nstill useful, although our analytic formulas underpredict the covariances and\nuncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2008 15:08:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2008 01:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is known that for every real n x n matrix, A,\nif no real eigenvalue of A is negative or zero, then A has a real logarithm,\nthat is, there is a real matrix, X, such that e^X = A. Furthermore, if the\neigenvalues, xi, of X satisfy the property -pi < Im(xi) < pi, then X is unique.\nIt is also known that under the same condition every real n x n matrix, A, has\na real square root, that is, there is a real matrix, X, such that X^2 = A.\nMoreover, if the eigenvalues, rho e^{i theta}, of X satisfy the condition -pi/2\n< theta < pi/2, then X is unique. These theorems are the theoretical basis for\nvarious numerical methods for exponentiating a matrix or for computing its\nlogarithm using a method known as scaling and squaring (resp. inverse scaling\nand squaring). Such methods play an important role in the log-Euclidean\nframework due to Arsigny, Fillard, Pennec and Ayache and its applications to\nmedical imaging. Actually, there is a necessary and sufficient condition for a\nreal matrix to have a real logarithm (or a real square root) but it is fairly\nsubtle as it involves the parity of the number of Jordan blocks associated with\nnegative eigenvalues. As far as I know, with the exception of Higham's recent\nbook, proofs of these results are scattered in the literature and it is not\neasy to locate them. Moreover, Higham's excellent book assumes a certain level\nof background in linear algebra that readers interested in the topics of this\npaper may not possess so we feel that a more elementary presentation might be a\nvaluable supplement to Higham. In these notes, I present a unified exposition\nof these results and give more direct proofs of some of them using the Real\nJordan Form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2008 15:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2013 18:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}
