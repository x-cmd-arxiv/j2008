We developed a biophysical model for the sequence dependence of DNA\nbending energies, and validated it against a collection of in vitro free\nenergies of nucleosome formation and a nucleosome crystal structure; we also\nsuccessfully designed both strong and poor histone binding sequences ab initio.\nFor in vivo data from S.cerevisiae, the strongest positioning signal came from\nthe competition with other factors. Based on sequence alone, our model predicts\nthat functional transcription factor binding sites have a tendency to be\ncovered by nucleosomes, but are uncovered in vivo because functional sites\ncluster within a single nucleosome footprint, making transcription factors bind\ncooperatively. Similarly a weak enhancement of nucleosome binding in the TATA\nregion for naked DNA becomes a strong depletion when the TATA-binding protein\nis included, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Predictions at specific\nloci were also greatly enhanced by including competing factors. Our physically\ngrounded model distinguishes multiple ways in which genomic sequence can\ninfluence nucleosome positions and thus provides an alternative explanation for\nseveral important experimental findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2008 17:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-28"}

The parameter k, which is\nthe diffusion coefficient for the jump, is a random quantity also; in each\njump, it is drawn from a PDF, p(k)~1/k^gamma (0<gamma<1).

The extended\nmonitoring of four 4GB flash drives with no casing and various information\ncontent indicate a significant correlation between their weight variations and\nthe fluctuations of ambient humidity. This is an evidence for the role of\nhumidity and hygroscopic components, at least, for long-term weight\nfluctuations. A sequence of information changing experiments with such a flash\ndrives at stable humidity conditions shows a significant variability of the\ntransients of the absolute mass with some dependence on the information\ncontent. Finally, a related new experiment was carried out with olive oil and\nchilli pepper powder that was dissolved in it while the mass variations were\nrecorded and a positive mass transient of 0.3 milligram was observed for about\n10 minutes. The process represents the writing of new random information into a\nmedium.

We show that the distribution of\nbulge Sersic indices is bimodal, and this bimodality correlates with the\nmorphology of the bulge. Pseudobulges have n<2 and classical bulges have n>2\nwith little overlap. Also, pseudobulges do not follow the correlations of\nSersic index with structural parameters or the photometric projections of the\nfundamental plane in the same way as classical bulges and elliptical galaxies\ndo. We find that pseudobulges are systematically flatter than classical bulges\nand thus more disk-like in both their morphology and shape. We do not find\nsignificant differences between different bulge morphologies that we are\ncollectively calling pseudobulges (nuclear spirals, nuclear rings, nuclear\nbars, and nuclear patchiness) appear to behave similarly in all parameter\ncorrelations.

However, the nodes on the boundary of such\nnetworks cannot benefit from this strategy, as the other nodes do not depend on\nthem. This problem is sometimes known as {\\em the curse of the boundary nodes}.\nTo overcome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in\nwhich the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone\nnodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing\nto forward the boundary nodes' packets. Here, the concept of core is used to\nstudy the stability of the coalitions in such games. Then three types of\nfairness are investigated, namely, min-max fairness using nucleolus, average\nfairness using the Shapley function, and a newly proposed market fairness.\nBased on the specific problem addressed in this paper, market fairness is a new\nfairness concept involving fairness between multiple backbone nodes and\nmultiple boundary nodes. Finally, a protocol is designed using both repeated\ngames and coalition games. Simulation results show how boundary nodes and\nbackbone nodes form coalitions according to different fairness criteria.

We use the STOKES radiative\ntransfer code to show that electron and Rayleigh scattering off the BLR and\ntorus naturally explains the blueshifted profiles of high-ionization lines and\nthe ionization dependence of the blueshifts. This result is insensitive to the\ngeometry of the scattering region. If correct, this model resolves the\nlong-standing conflict between the absence of outflow implied by\nvelocity-resolved reverberation mapping and the need for outflow if the\nblueshifting is the result of obscuration. The accretion rate implied by the\ninflow is sufficient to power the AGN. We suggest that the BLR is part of the\nouter accretion disk and that similar MHD processes are operating. In the\nscattering model the blueshifting is proportional to the accretion rate so\nhigh-accretion-rate AGNs will show greater high-ionization line blueshifts as\nis observed. Scattering can lead to systematically too high black hole mass\nestimates from the C IV line. We note many similarities between narrow-line\nregion (NLR) and BLR blueshiftings, and suggest that NLR blueshiftings have a\nsimilar explanation. Our model explains the higher blueshifts of broad\nabsorption line QSOs if they are more highly inclined. Rayleigh scattering from\nthe BLR and torus could be more important in the UV than electron scattering\nfor predominantly neutral material around AGNs. The importance of Rayleigh\nscattering versus electron scattering can be assessed by comparing line\nprofiles at different wavelengths arising from the same emission-line region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 05:10:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 21:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 May 2008 21:26:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 19:19:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 03:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

The model\npredicts that the viscous stress in these systems should be a proportional to\nCa^1/2, where Ca is the capillary number and n = 1/2 is the power-law index. In\nthe current paper we explain in detail our model and develop it further in\nseveral aspects: First, we extend the model to account for the effects of\nviscous friction in the curved meniscus regions, surrounding the planar films,\non the dynamics of film formation and on the total viscous stress. Second, we\nconsider the effects of surface forces (electrostatic, van der Waals, etc.)\nacting between the surfaces of the neighboring bubbles/drops and show that\nthese forces could be important in emulsions, due to the relatively small\nthickness of emulsion films (often comparable to the range of action of the\nsurface forces). Third, additional consideration is made for bubbles/drops\nexhibiting high surface viscosity, for which we demonstrate an additional\ncontribution to the macroscopic viscous stress, created by the surface\ndissipation of energy. The new upgraded model predicts that the energy\ndissipation at the bubble/drop surface leads to power-law index n < 1/2,\nwhereas the contribution of the surface forces leads to n > 1/2, which explains\nthe rich variety of foam/emulsion behaviors observed upon steady shear. Various\ncomparisons are made between model predictions and experimental results for\nboth foams and emulsions, and a very good agreement is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 08:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The standard definition of a family of perfect hash functions\nrequires that there will be at least one function that is 1-1 on $S$, for each\n$S$ of size $k$.

The gravitational field,\nmainly that of the Sun and the motion of LISA affect the time-delays and the\noptical links. Further, the effect of the gravitational field of the Earth on\nthe orbits of spacecraft is included. This leads to additional flexing over and\nabove that of the Sun. We have written a numerical code which computes the\noptical links, that is, the time-delays with great accuracy $\\sim 10^{-2}$\nmetres - more than what is required for time delay interferometry (TDI) - for\nmost of the orbit and with sufficient accuracy within $\\sim 10$ metres for an\nintegrated time window of about six days, when one of the arms tends to be\ntangent to the orbit.

We extend the model to a penalized game (PCG), for which we\nreduce the penalty counted towards the individual cost for a pair of\ndisconnected players to a finite value \\beta. Our analysis concentrates on\nexistence, structure, and cost of disconnected Nash and strong equilibria.\nAlthough the PCG is not a potential game, pure Nash equilibria always and pure\nstrong equilibria very often exist. We provide tight conditions under which\ndisconnected Nash (strong) equilibria can evolve. Components of these\nequilibria must be Nash (strong) equilibria of a smaller NCG.

Using two-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we adopt a temperature for the ambient medium of 3E6 K along with\na range of ambient densities and stellar velocities. When the stellar velocity\nis supersonic relative to the ambient medium, a bow shock occurs, along with a\nshock driven into the stellar ejecta, which heats only a fraction of the gas.\nBehind the bow shock, a cool wake develops but the fast flow of the hot medium\ncauses Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to grow and these fingers are shocked and\nheated (without radiative cooling). Along with the mixing of this wake material\nwith the hot medium, most of the stellar ejecta is heated to approximately the\ntemperature of the hot ambient medium within 2 pc of the star. With the\naddition of radiative cooling, some wake material remains cool (< 1E5 K),\naccounting for up to 25% of the stellar mass loss.

These differences between the two approaches are in\nparticular visible in the optical conductivity, where Masek's model shows a\nDrude peak at zero frequency while no such peak is observed in Tang and\nFlatte's model. Interestingly, although the two models differ qualitatively the\ncalculated effective optical masses of both models are similar within the range\nof 0.4-1.0 of the free electron mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 13:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-17"}

We\nexplain how the evolution equation for this kind of a shower can be formulated.\nWe discuss briefly our efforts to implement this evolution equation\nnumerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 15:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-29"}

Two private messages as well as a common\nmessage are transmitted; the common message is to be decoded by both receivers,\nwhile each private message is only for its intended receiver. In addition, each\nprivate message is to be kept secret from the unintended receiver where secrecy\nis measured by equivocation. We propose both inner and outer bounds to the rate\nequivocation region for broadcast channels with confidential messages. The\nproposed inner bound generalizes Csisz\\'{a}r and K\\\"{o}rner's rate equivocation\nregion for broadcast channels with a single confidential message, Liu {\\em et\nal}'s achievable rate region for broadcast channels with perfect secrecy,\nMarton's and Gel'fand and Pinsker's achievable rate region for general\nbroadcast channels. Our proposed outer bounds, together with the inner bound,\nhelps establish the rate equivocation region of several classes of discrete\nmemoryless broadcast channels with confidential messages, including less noisy,\ndeterministic, and semi-deterministic channels. Furthermore, specializing to\nthe general broadcast channel by removing the confidentiality constraint, our\nproposed outer bounds reduce to new capacity outer bounds for the discrete\nmemory broadcast channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 15:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

By studying\nthe spontaneous emission of an atom in a photonic crystal with one-band\nisotropic model, we found that the long-time inducing memory of the spontaneous\nemission is a fractional phenomenon. This behavior could be well described by\nthe fractional calculus. And the results show no steady photon-atom bound state\nfor the atomic resonant transition frequency lying in the proximity of allowed\nband edge which is encountered in the previous study [J. Opt. B: Quantum\nSemiclass. Opt. {\\bf 5}, R43 (2003)]. The correctness of this result is\nvalidated by the ``cut-off smoothing'' density of photon states (DOS) with\nfractional calculus.

Only if we have a bimodal size distribution, i.e. a very small\ngrain population and a bigger grain population, do we find that the\ntransformation from a flat to a pointy feature upon dust sedimentation is\nstrong. However, our model shows that, if sedimentation is the sole reason for\nthe variety of silicate feature strengths observed in protoplanetary disks,\nthen we would expect to find a correlation such that disks with weak mid- to\nfar-infrared excess have a stronger 10 mum silicate feature than disks with a\nstrong mid- to far-infrared excess. If this is contrary to what is observed,\nthen this would indicate that sedimentation cannot be the main reason for the\nvariety of 10 mum silicate features observed in protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 15:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
