A thermodynamics formally\nidentical to that in an ES can be formulated, but with definitions of work and\nheat as those needed to maintain the NESS. In this approach, the heat plays a\ncrucial role and is directly related to the different behavior of a system?s\nforward and backward paths in time in an appropriate function space. However,\nan ambiguity in the choice of the time- backward path corresponding to a given\ntime-forward path prevents a unique general formal theory for systems in a\nNESS. Unique unambiguous physically acceptable physical results for a system in\na NESS appear to be obtainable only after specifying the physical\nnonequilibrium parameters, which define a system in a NESS as part of a larger\nsystem. NESS systems are therefore fundamentally different from those in an ES.\nFurthermore, an example is given for a particular system that the fluctuations\nof a system in a NESS behave in many respects very differently from those in a\nsystem in an ES.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2008 16:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-24"}

Space-time responses of multi-component\nlinearized Vlasov plasmas on the basis of multiple integral equations are\ninvoked. An initial-value problem for Vlasov-Poisson -Ampere equations is\nreduced to the one multiple integral equation and the solution is expressed in\nterms of forcing function and its space-time convolution with the resolvent\nkernel. The forcing function is responsible for the initial disturbance and the\nresolvent is responsible for the equilibrium velocity distributions of plasma\nspecies. By use of resolvent equations, time-reversibility, space-reflexivity\nand the other symmetries are revealed. The symmetries carry on physical\nproperties of Vlasov pair plasmas, e.g., conservation laws. Properly choosing\nequilibrium distributions for dusty pair plasmas, we can reduce the resolvent\nequation to: (i) the undamped dispersive wave equations, (ii) wave-diffusive\ntransport equation (iii) and diffusive transport equations of oscillations. In\nthe last case we have to do with anomalous diffusion employing fractional\nderivatives in time and space. Fractional diffusion equations account for\ntypical anomalous features, which are observed in many systems, e.g. in the\ncase of dispersive transport in amorphous semiconductors, liquid crystals,\npolymers, proteins and biosystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2008 19:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Weak lensing is\nsensitive to the growth of structure and the relation between matter and\ngravitational potentials, both of which will in general be affected by modified\ngravity. Restricting ourselves to linear scales, we compare the predictions for\ngalaxy-shear and shear-shear correlations of each modified gravity cosmology to\nthose of an effective Dark Energy cosmology with the same expansion history. In\nthis way, the effects of modified gravity on the growth of perturbations are\nseparated from the expansion history. We also propose a test which isolates the\nmatter-potential relation from the growth factor and matter power spectrum. For\nall three modified gravity models, the predictions for galaxy and shear\ncorrelations will be discernible from those of Dark Energy with very high\nsignificance in future weak lensing surveys. Furthermore, each model predicts a\nmeasurably distinct scale dependence and redshift evolution of galaxy and shear\ncorrelations, which can be traced back to the physical foundations of each\nmodel.

In static, asymptotically flat\ncases, the Hawking temperature as usually defined by the Killing vector agrees\nin standard cases, but generally differs by a relative redshift factor between\nthe horizon and infinity, being the temperature measured by static observers at\ninfinity.

Structure within jet beams is often\nattributed to periodic or ``pulsed'' variations of conditions at the jet\nsource. Simulations based on this scenario result in knots extending across the\njet diameter. Observations and recent high energy density laboratory\nexperiments shed new light on structures below this scale and indicate they may\nbe important for understanding the fundamentals of jet dynamics. In this paper\nwe offer an alternative to ``pulsed'' models of protostellar jets. Using direct\nnumerical simulations we explore the possibility that jets are chains of\nsub-radial clumps propagating through a moving inter-clump medium. Our models\nexplore an idealization of this scenario by injecting small ($r<r_{jet}$),\ndense ($\\rho>\\rho_{jet}$) spheres embedded in an otherwise smooth inter-clump\njet flow. The spheres are initialized with velocities differing from the jet\nvelocity by $\\sim15$%. We find the consequences of shifting from homogeneous to\nheterogeneous flows are significant as clumps interact with each other and with\nthe inter-clump medium in a variety of ways. Structures which mimic what is\nexpected from pulsed-jet models can form, as can previously unseen\n``sub-radial'' behaviors including backward facing bow shocks and off-axis\nworking surfaces. While these small-scale structures have not been seen before\nin simulation studies, they are found in high resolution jet observations. We\ndiscuss implications of our simulations for the interpretation of protostellar\njets with regard to characterization of knots by a ``lifetime'' or ``velocity\nhistory'' approach as well as linking observed structures with central engines\nwhich produce the jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2008 22:10:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2008 19:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The viscous perturbation equations\nare then combined in terms of the vorticity and velocity, and are solved by\nmeans of a combined Laplace-Fourier transform in the plane normal to the basic\nflow. This treatment allows for a simplification of the governing equations\nsuch that it is possible to observe long transients, that can last hundreds\ntime scales. This result would not be possible over an acceptable lapse of time\nby carrying out a direct numerical integration of the linearized Navier-Stokes\nequations. The exploration is done with respect to physical inputs as the angle\nof obliquity, the symmetry of the perturbation and the streamwise damping rate.\nThe base flow is an intermediate section of the growing 2D circular cylinder\nwake where the entrainment process is still active. Two Reynolds numbers of the\norder of the critical value for the onset of the first instability are\nconsidered. The early transient evolution offers very different scenarios for\nwhich we present a summary for particular cases. For example, for amplified\nperturbations, we have observed two kinds of transients, namely (1) a monotone\namplification and (2) a sequence of growth - decrease - final growth. In the\nlatter case, if the initial condition is an asymmetric oblique or longitudinal\nperturbation, the transient clearly shows an initial oscillatory time scale.\nFurthermore, the more a perturbation is longitudinally confined the more it is\namplified in time. The long-term behavior of two-dimensional disturbances shows\nexcellent agreement with a recent two-dimensional spatio-temporal multiscale\nmodal analysis and with laboratory data concerning the frequency and wave\nlength of the parallel vortex shedding in the cylinder wake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 May 2008 10:41:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 15:56:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 15:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

We show how the Singapore protocol for key\ndistribution is optimal from this point of view, due to the fact that it is\nbased on so called SIC POVM qubit tomography which allows the most accurate\nfull tomographic reconstruction of an unknown density matrix on the basis of a\nrestricted set of experimental data. We illustrate with the help of\nexperimental data the deep connections that exist between SIC POVM tomography\nand discrete Wigner representations. We also emphasise the special role played\nby Bell states in this approach and propose a new protocol for Quantum Key\nDistribution during which a third party is able to concede or to deny A\nPOSTERIORI to the authorized users the ability to build a fresh cryptographic\nkey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 May 2008 12:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
