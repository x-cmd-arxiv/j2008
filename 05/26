Potent\nImmunoglobulins are discovered in this model via clonal selection and affinity\nmaturation. Possible outcomes of an infection (extinction of cells, survival\nwith complete elimination of viruses, or persistent infection) crucially depend\non mutation rates of viral and Immunoglobulin proteins. The model predicts that\nthere is an optimal Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) rate close to experimentally\nobserved 10-3 per nucleotide per replication. Further, we developed an\nanalytical theory which explains the physical reason for an optimal SHM program\nas a compromise between deleterious effects of random mutations on nascent\nmaturing Immunoglobulins (adversity) and the need to generate diverse pool of\nmutated antibodies from which highly potent ones can be drawn (diversity). The\ntheory explains such effects as dependence of B cell fate on affinity for an\nincoming antigen, ceiling in affinity of mature antibodies, Germinal Center\nsizes and maturation times. The theory reveals the molecular factors which\ndetermine the efficiency of affinity maturation, providing insight into\nvariability of immune response to cytopathic (direct response by germline\nantibodies) and poorly cytopathic viruses (crucial role of SHM in response).\nThese results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of microscopic\nsequence-based models of immune system, where population dynamics of evolving\nImmunoglobulins is explicitly tied to their molecular properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 May 2008 17:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-27"}

However,\ncomplex Legendrian subvarieties are much more rigid and have more exceptional\nproperties. The most remarkable case is the Legendrian subvarieties of\nprojective space and prior to the author's research only few smooth examples of\nthese were known.\n  The first series of results of this thesis is related to the automorphism\ngroup of any Legendrian subvariety in any projective contact manifold. The\nconnected component of this group (under suitable minor assumptions) is\ncompletely determined by the sections of the distinguished line bundle on the\ncontact manifold vanishing on the Legendrian variety. Moreover its action\npreserves the contact structure.\n  The second series of results is devoted to finding new examples of smooth\nLegendrian subvarieties of projective space. The contribution of this thesis is\nin three steps: First we find an example of a smooth toric surface. Next we\nfind a smooth quasihomogeneous Fano 8-fold that admits a Legendrian embedding.\nFinally, we realise that both of these are special cases of a very general\nconstruction: a general hyperplane section of a smooth Legendrian variety,\nafter a suitable projection, is a smooth Legendrian variety of smaller\ndimension. By applying this result to known examples and decomposable\nLegendrian varieties, we construct infinitely many new examples in every\ndimension, with various Picard rank, canonical degree, Kodaira dimension and\nother invariants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 May 2008 19:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 22:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-16"}

Incorporating the prescription of \\cite{HAC99a} for the accretion\nefficiency into Eggleton's stellar evolution code and assuming that the\nprescription is valid for all metallicities, we performed binary stellar\nevolution calculations for more than 25,000 close WD binary systems with\nvarious metallicities.

The Galactic birth rate from the\nchannel is lower than (but comparable to) that inferred from observations.\n  We also showed the distributions of the parameters of the binary systems at\nthe moment of supernova explosion and the distributions of the properties of\ncompanions after supernova explosion. The former provides physics input to\nsimulate the interaction between supernova ejecta and its companion, and the\nlatter is helpful to search for the companions in supernova remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2008 01:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In particular, we consider the\nabsorption of scalar particles with large angular momentum by a black hole.\nIgnoring back reaction effects may lead one to conclude that the incident wave\nmay overspin the black hole, thereby exposing its inner singularity to distant\nobservers. However, we show that when back reaction effects are properly taken\ninto account, the stability of the black-hole event horizon is irrefutable. We\ntherefore conclude that cosmic censorship is actually respected in this type of\ngedanken experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2008 04:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this paper, a set of benchmarks is described that\nexplicitly measures the performance of kernels containing a variety of\ndifferent access patterns found in real world applications. By offering a\nvarying degree of complexity, we provide a platform for measuring the\neffectiveness of transformations. The difference in complexity stems from a\ndifference in traversal patterns, the use of multiple indirections and control\nflow statements. The kernels used cover a variety of different access patterns,\nnamely pointer traversals, indirection arrays, dynamic loop bounds and run-time\ndependent if-conditions. The kernels are small enough to be fully understood\nwhich makes this benchmark set very suitable for the evaluation of\nrestructuring transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2008 08:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-27"}

The BAT data were used to carry out time-resolved spectroscopy\nin the 14-100keV range down to 8ms timescales.\n  This unique dataset allowed us to test the magnetar model predictions such as\nthe magnetically trapped fireball and the twisted magnetosphere over an\nunprecedented range of fluxes and with large statistics (in terms of both\nphotons and IFs). We confirmed that a two blackbody component fits adequately\nthe time-resolved and integrated spectra of IFs. However, Comptonization models\ngive comparable good reduced chi^2. Moreover, we found: i) a change of\nbehavior, around ~10^{41} erg/s, above which the softer blackbody shows a sort\nof saturation while the harder one still grows to a few times 10^{41} erg/s;\nii) a rather sharp correlation between temperature and radii of the blackbodies\n(R^2 prop kT^{-3}), which holds for the most luminous parts of the flares\n(approximately for L_{tot} > 10^{41} erg/s). Within the magnetar model, the\nmajority of these findings can be accounted for in terms of thermalised\nemission from the E-mode and O-mode photospheres. Interestingly, the maximum\nobserved luminosity coming from a region of ~15km matches the magnetic\nEddington luminosity at the same radius, for a surface dipole field of ~8 x\n10^{14} G (virtually equal to the one deduced from the spindown of SGR\n1900+14).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2008 11:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We estimate the accretion rate of gas\nassociated with their hot coronae by analyzing archival Chandra data, to derive\nthe deprojected density and temperature profiles in a spherical approximation.\nMeasuring the jet power from the nuclear radio-luminosity, we find that the\naccretion power correlates linearly with the jet power, with an efficiency of\nconversion from rest mass into jet power of ~0.012. These results strengthen\nand extend the validity of the results obtained by Allen and collaborators for\n9 radio galaxies, indicating that hot gas accretion is the dominant process in\nFR I radio galaxies across their full range of radio-luminosity.\n  We find that the different levels of nuclear activity are driven by global\ndifferences in the structure of the galactic hot coronae. A linear relation\nlinks the jet power with the host X-ray surface brightness.

A harmonic oscillator bath of\nDrude type with cutoff frequency omega_D is employed to model an ohmic friction\nforce with dissipation strength gamma. Two scenarios for obtaining specific\nheat are presented. The first one uses the measurement of the kinetic energy of\nthe free particle while the second one is based on the reduced partition\nfunction. Both descriptions yield results which are consistent with the Third\nLaw of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, the two methods produce different results\nthat disagree even in their leading quantum corrections at high temperatures.\nWe also consider the regime where the cutoff frequency is smaller than the\nfriction strength, i.e. omega_D<gamma. There, we encounter puzzling results at\nlow temperatures where the specific heat based on the thermodynamic\nprescription becomes negative. This anomaly is rooted in an ill-defined density\nof states of the damped free particle which assumes unphysical negative values\nwhen gamma/omega_D>1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2008 14:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-21"}

Coupling of the molecule\nto electrodes becomes asymmetric at high bias due to asymmetry between its\nhighest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular\norbital (LUMO) levels. This causes appearance of an asymmetric potential\nprofile due to a depletion of charge and reduction of screening near the source\nelectrode. With increasing bias, this sharp potential drop leads to an enhanced\nlocalization of the HOMO and LUMO states in different parts of the system. The\nreduction in overlap, caused by localization, results in a significant\nreduction in the transmission coefficient and current with increasing bias. An\natomic chain connected to two Graphene ribbons was investigated to illustrate\nthese effects.

In this we follow recent proposals inspired by\n``hydrodynamic'' descriptions of pattern formation in aeolian sand dunes and\nion-sputtered systems. From this enlarged model, and by exploiting the\ntime-scale separation among various dynamical processes in the system, we\nderive a single height equation in which coefficients can be related to\nexperimental parameters.
