The magnetic field thus breaks\naxisymmetry, in agreement with Cowling's theorem. This structure of the\nmagnetic field is however replaced by a dominant axial dipole when Re is larger\nand allows non axisymmetric fluctuations in the flow. We show here that even in\nthe absence of such fluctuations, an axial dipole can also be generated, at low\nRe, through a secondary bifurcation, when Rm is increased above the dynamo\nthreshold. The system therefore always find a way to bypass the constraint\nimposed by Cowling's theorem.

These radio galaxies, 4C +23.56\n(z=2.48) and 6C J1908+7220 (z=3.53), both show strong mid-infrared continua,\nbut with 6C J1908+7220 also showing strong PAH emission at rest-frame 6.2 and\n7.7um. In 4C+23.56 we see no obvious PAH features above the continuum. The PAH\nemission in 6C J1908+7220 is the amongst the most distant observed to date and\nimplies that there is a large instantaneous star formation rate (SFR). This is\nconsistent with the strong detection of 6C J1908+7220 at far-IR and sub-mm\nwavelengths, indicative of large amounts of cold dust, ~10^9Msun. Powerful\nradio galaxies at lower redshifts tend to have weak or undetectable PAH\nfeatures and typically have lower far-IR luminosities. In addition, 4C 23.56\nshows moderate silicate absorption as seen in less luminous radio galaxies,\nindicating tau_{9.7um}=0.3+/-0.05. This feature is shifted out of the observed\nwavelength range for 6C J1908+7220. The correlation of strong PAH features with\nlarge amounts of cold dust, despite the presence of a powerful AGN, is in\nagreement with other recent results and implies that star formation at high\nredshift is, in some cases at least, associated with powerful, obscured AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2008 19:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Both of these effects can\nalter the predicted YORP rate of change in angular velocity and obliquity. We\napply these corrections to the Itokawa shape model and find that its YORP\nangular velocity rate is sensitive to offsets between its center of mass and\ncenter of figure, with a shift on the order of 10 meters being able to change\nthe sign of the YORP effect for that asteroid. Given the non-detection of YORP\nfor Itokawa as of 2008, this can shed light on the density distribution within\nthat body. The theory supports a shift of the asteroid center of mass towards\nItokawa's neck region, where there is an accumulation of finer gravels.\nDetection of the YORP effect for Itokawa should provide some strong constraints\non its density distribution.

This object was classified as a planetary nebula, however,\nits true nature is under debate. In the period 1955-1990 the central star was\nalmost undetectable and only nebular emission lines were observed. In 1990, the\nbeginning of an outburst was detected and in few months it became much brighter\nand developed wide He and N lines, typical of a Wolf Rayet star of the\nN-sequence. The maximum occurred in 1994 and afterwards the star slowly faded.\nAnalysis of its evolution showed that it has a variable mass-loss rate which\noccasionally increases enormously, creating a false photosphere at a much\nlarger radius, making it appear a few magnitudes brighter. The present outburst\nhas occurred 13 years after the episode from 1994 to 2000. So far this new\nevent has similar characteristics although there are some significant\ndifferences in the spectral features. We present optical and FUSE spectra\nshowing the main properties of this latter event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2008 23:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-16"}

In this paper,\n\\textit{Forward Error Correction} (FEC) is applied across multiple independent\npaths to enhance the end-to-end reliability. Network paths are modeled as\nerasure Gilbert-Elliot channels. It is known that over any erasure channel,\n\\textit{Maximum Distance Separable} (MDS) codes achieve the minimum probability\nof irrecoverable loss among all block codes of the same size. Based on the\nadopted model for the error behavior, we prove that the probability of\nirrecoverable loss for MDS codes decays exponentially for an asymptotically\nlarge number of paths. Then, optimal rate allocation problem is solved for the\nasymptotic case where the number of paths is large. Moreover, it is shown that\nin such asymptotically optimal rate allocation, each path is assigned a\npositive rate \\textit{iff} its quality is above a certain threshold. The\nquality of a path is defined as the percentage of the time it spends in the bad\nstate. Finally, using dynamic programming, a heuristic suboptimal algorithm\nwith polynomial runtime is proposed for rate allocation over a finite number of\npaths. This algorithm converges to the asymptotically optimal rate allocation\nwhen the number of paths is large. The simulation results show that the\nproposed algorithm approximates the optimal rate allocation (found by\nexhaustive search) very closely for practical number of paths, and provides\nsignificant performance improvement compared to the alternative schemes of rate\nallocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2008 23:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-16"}

The $\\k$-complexity of a\ngraphical realization is defined to be the largest dimension of any of its\nlocal constraint codes. $\\k$-complexity is a reasonable measure of the\ncomputational complexity of a sum-product decoding algorithm specified by a\ngraphical realization. The main focus of this paper is on the following\nproblem: given a linear code C and a graph G, how small can the $\\k$-complexity\nof a realization of C on G be? As useful tools for attacking this problem, we\nintroduce the Vertex-Cut Bound, and the notion of ``vc-treewidth'' for a graph,\nwhich is closely related to the well-known graph-theoretic notion of treewidth.\nUsing these tools, we derive tight lower bounds on the $\\k$-complexity of any\nrealization of C on G.

Along the way, we also prove the interesting result that\nthe ratio of the $\\k$-complexity of the best conventional trellis realization\nof a length-n code C to the $\\k$-complexity of the best cycle-free realization\nof C grows at most logarithmically with codelength n.

By\nexploiting the fluctuation-dissipation relations the covariance matrix of\ndensity fluctuations is derived as a function of the wave vector for nuclear\nmatter at given values of density, charge asymmetry, temperature, and of the\ntime that the system spends in the instability region. Then density\nfluctuations in ordinary space are implemented with a Fourier transform\nperformed in a finite cubic lattice. Inside this box, domains with different\ndensity coexist, from which clusters of nucleons eventually emerge. Within our\napproach, the isotopic distributions are determined by the N/Z ratio of the\nleading unstable isoscalarlike mode and by isovectorlike fluctuations present\nin the matter undergoing the spinodal decomposition. Hence the average value of\nthe N/Z ratio of clusters and the width of the relative distribution reflect\nthe properties of the symmetry energy. Generating a large number of events,\nthese calculations allow a careful investigation of the cluster isotopic\ncontent as a function of the cluster density. A uniform decrease of the average\ncharge asymmetry and of the width of the isotopic distributions with increasing\ndensity is observed. Finally we remark that the results essentially refer to\nthe early break--up of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 10:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This distribution is useful for modeling count data\nthat may have extra zeros. One question is whether the mixture model can be\nreduced to the power series portion, corresponding to $p=0$, or whether there\nare so many zeros in the data that zero inflation relative to the pure power\nseries distribution must be included in the model i.e., $p\\geq0$.

Accurate estimation of\npositive FDR (pFDR), a variant of the FDR, is essential in assessing and\ncontrolling this measure. In a recent paper, the authors proposed a model-based\nnonparametric Bayesian method of estimation of the pFDR function. In\nparticular, the density of p-values was modeled as a mixture of decreasing beta\ndensities and an appropriate Dirichlet process was considered as a prior on the\nmixing measure. The resulting procedure was shown to work well in simulations.\nIn this paper, we provide some theoretical results in support of the beta\nmixture model for the density of p-values, and show that, under appropriate\nconditions, the resulting posterior is consistent as the number of hypotheses\ngrows to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 11:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Clusters show two distinct regimes of clustering: 1) on\nscales of superclusters (~40/h Mpc) the CCF is represented by a power law; 2)\non larger scales a gradual transition to homogeneity (~100/h Mpc) is observed.\nWe also present the correlation analysis of the galaxy distribution taken from\nDR6 SDSS main galaxy database.

The differences\nin the characteristic scales and scaling exponents of the cluster and galaxy\ndistribution can be naturally explained within the theory of biased structure\nformation. We compared the density contrasts of inhomogeneities in the cluster\nand galaxy distributions in the SDSS region. The estimation of the relative\ncluster-galaxy bias gives the value b = 5 +/- 2.

We present the entropy-T relations at six characteristics radii (30\nkpc - r_500), for 43 groups from this work and 14 clusters from Vikhlinin et\nal. (2008). Despite large scatter in the entropy values at <0.15 r_500, the\nintrinsic scatter from r_2500 is much smaller and remains the same (~10%) to\nr_500.

For\nsuch nuclei, one-nucleon overlap integrals that represent single-particle\nmotion can strongly differ from the standard ones due to the correlations\nbetween the two nucleons above the core. The possible non-standard overlap\nbehaviour should be included in the interpretation of the experimental data\nderived from one nucleon removal reactions such as knockout, transfer and\nbreakup, as well as the predictions of low-energy nucleon capture that leads to\nthese nuclei. We investigate the non-standard behaviour within a three-body\nmodel and discuss the challenges associated with this problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 15:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In addition to the constrained MSSM\n(CMSSM) in which these are universal with the soft supersymmetry-breaking\ncontributions to the squark and slepton masses at the input GUT scale, we\nconsider scenarios in which both the Higgs scalar masses are non-universal by\nthe same amount (NUHM1), and scenarios in which they are independently\nnon-universal (NUHM2). We show how the NUHM1 scenarios generalize the (m_{1/2},\nm_0) planes of the CMSSM by allowing either mu or m_A to take different (fixed)\nvalues and we also show how the NUHM1 scenarios are embedded as special cases\nof the more general NUHM2 scenarios. Generalizing from the CMSSM, we find\nregions of the NUHM1 parameter space that are excluded because the LSP is a\nselectron. We also find new regions where the neutralino relic density falls\nwithin the range preferred by astrophysical and cosmological measurements,\nthanks to rapid annihilation through direct-channel Higgs poles, or\ncoannihilation with selectrons, or because the LSP composition crosses over\nfrom being mainly bino to mainly Higgsino. Generalizing further to the NUHM2,\nwe find regions of its parameter space where a sneutrino is the LSP, and others\nwhere neutralino coannihilation with sneutrinos is important for the relic\ndensity. In both the NUHM1 and the NUHM2, there are slivers of parameter space\nwhere the LHC has fewer prospects for discovering sparticles than in the CMSSM,\nbecause either m_{1/2} and/or m_0 may be considerably larger than in the CMSSM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 15:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

First- and second-kind scaling\nare analyzed for neutrino beam energies ranging from 1 to 2 GeV for the cases\nof 12C, 16O and 40Ca. Different detection angles of the outgoing nucleon are\nconsidered in order to sample various nucleon energy regimes. Scaling of the\nsecond kind is shown to be very robust. Validity of first-kind scaling is found\nto be linked to the kinematics of the process. Superscaling still prevails even\nin the presence of very strong final-state interactions, provided that some\nkinematical restrains are kept, and the conditions under which superscaling can\nbe applied to predict neutral-current quasielastic neutrino scattering are\ndetermined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 15:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
