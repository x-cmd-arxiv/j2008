Here we illustrate how the peculiar velocity effect\nin SN Ia data can be turned from a 'systematic' into a probe of cosmological\nparameters. We assume a flat Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model (w=-1) and use low\nand high redshift SN Ia data to derive simultaneously three distinct estimates\nof the matter density Omega_m which appear in the problem: from the geometry,\nfrom the dynamics and from the shape of the matter power spectrum. We find that\neach of the three Omega_m's agree with the canonical value Omega_m=0.25 to\nwithin 1 sigma, for reasonably assumed fluctuation amplitude and Hubble\nparameter. This is consistent with the standard cosmological scenario for both\nthe geometry and the growth of structure. For fixed Omega_m = 0.25 for all\nthree Omega_m's, we constrain gamma = 0.72 +/- 0.21 in the growth factor\nOmega_m(z)^gamma, so we cannot currently distinguish between standard Einstein\ngravity and predictions from some modified gravity models.

We study the physical consequences of the\ndistinction between the usual concept of spatial homogeneity (SH), as defined\nby the Cosmological Principle, and the concept of observational homogeneity\n(OH), arguing that OH is in principle falsifiable by means of astronomical\nobservations, whereas verifying SH is only possible indirectly. Simulated\ncounts of cosmological sources are produced by means of a generalized\nnumber-distance expression that can be specialized to produce either the counts\nof the Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) cosmology, which has SH by construction, or\nother types of counts, which do, or do not, have OH by construction.\nExpressions for observational volumes and differential densities are derived\nwith the various cosmological distance definitions in the EdS model. Simulated\ncounts that have OH by construction do not always exhibit SH features. The\nreverse situation is also true. Besides, simulated counts with no OH features\nat low redshift start showing OH characteristics at high redshift. The comoving\ndistance seems to be the only distance definition where both SH and OH appear\nsimultaneously. The results show that observations indicating possible lack of\nOH do not necessarily falsify the standard Friedmannian cosmology, meaning that\nthis cosmology will not necessarily always produce observable homogeneous\ndensities. The general conclusion is that the use of different cosmological\ndistances in the characterization of the galaxy distribution lead to\nsignificant ambiguities in reaching conclusions about the behavior of the\nlarge-scale galaxy distribution in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2008 19:33:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 May 2008 21:07:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 05:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-19"}

We present 95 such simulations that parametrically explore\nthe dependence on neutrino luminosity, mass accretion rate, resolution, and\ndimensionality.

The relation between halo mass and galaxy\nstellar mass is determined by matching the observed spatial abundance of\ngalaxies to the expected spatial abundance of halos at multiple epochs -- i.e.\nmore massive galaxies are assigned to more massive halos at each epoch. Halos\nat different epochs are connected by halo mass accretion histories estimated\nfrom N-body simulations. The halo--galaxy connection at fixed epochs in\nconjunction with the connection between halos across time provides a connection\nbetween observed galaxies across time. With approximations for the impact of\nmerging and accretion on the growth of galaxies, one can then directly infer\nthe star formation histories of galaxies as a function of stellar and halo\nmass. This model is tuned to match both the observed evolution of the stellar\nmass function and the normalization of the observed star formation rate --\nstellar mass relation to z~1. The data demands, for example, that the star\nformation rate density is dominated by galaxies with Mstar~10^{10.0-10.5} Msun\nfrom 0<z<1, and that such galaxies over these epochs reside in halos with\nM~10^{11.5-12.5} Msun. The star formation rate -- halo mass relation is\napproximately Gaussian over the range 0<z<1 with a mildly evolving mean and\nnormalization. This model is then used to shed light on a number of issues,\nincluding 1) a clarification of ``downsizing'', 2) the lack of a sharp\ncharacteristic halo mass at which star formation is truncated, and 3) the\ndominance of star formation over merging to the stellar build-up of galaxies\nwith Mstar<10^11 Msun at z<1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2008 14:27:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 14:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The bulk of the gas in the disc appears to be settled in regular rotation\nwith a total velocity range of 850 km/s, although asymmetries in this disc\nindicate that perturbations are being exerted on part of the gas, possibly by a\nnumber of nearby companions.

Therefore, the C18O and C17O\n(1-0), (2-1), and (3-2), as well as the 13CO (1-0) and (2-1) lines, were\nobserved towards 18 prominent galactic targets (a total of 25 positions). The\ncombined dataset was analysed with an LVG model, accounting for optical depth\neffects. The data cover galactocentric radii R between 0.1 and 16.9 kpc (solar\ncircle at 8.5 kpc). Near the centre of the Galaxy, 18O/17O = 2.88 +/- 0.11. For\nthe galactic disc out to an R of ca. 10 kpc, 18O/17O = 4.16 +/- 0.09. At ca. R\n= 16.5 kpc, 18O/17O = 5.03 +/- 0.46.

We revisit here this\nproblem, using the computation of the turbulent flow over a wavy bottom\nperformed in Part 1. The details of the different mechanisms controlling\nsediment transport are encoded into three quantities: the saturated flux, the\nsaturation length and the threshold shear stress. Theses quantities are\nmodelled in the case of erosion and momentum limited bed loads. This framework\nallows to give a clear picture of the instability in terms of dynamical\nmechanisms. The relation between the wavelength at which ripples form and the\nflux saturation length is quantitatively derived. Inverting the problem,\nexperimental data is used to determine the saturation length as a function of\ngrain size and shear velocity. Finally, using the systematic expansion of the\nflow field with respect to the corrugation amplitude, we discuss the non-linear\nselection of ripple aspect ratio. Investingating the effect of a free surface\non the linear instability, we show that the excitation of standing waves at the\nsurface has a stabilising effect, independently of the details of the flow and\nsediment transport models. Consequently, the shape of the dispersion relation\nis such that dunes can not result from a primary linear instability.

Since a generic curved\nspacetime does not possess symmetries or a unique notion of a vacuum state, the\ntheory also must be formulated in a manner that does not require symmetries or\na preferred notion of a ``vacuum state'' and ``particles''. We propose such a\nformulation of quantum field theory, wherein the operator product expansion\n(OPE) of the quantum fields is elevated to a fundamental status, and the\nquantum field theory is viewed as being defined by its OPE. Since the OPE\ncoefficients may be better behaved than any quantities having to do with\nstates, we suggest that it may be possible to perturbatively construct the OPE\ncoefficients--and, thus, the quantum field theory. By contrast, ground/vacuum\nstates--in spacetimes, such as Minkowski spacetime, where they may be\ndefined--cannot vary analytically with the parameters of the theory. We argue\nthat this implies that composite fields may acquire nonvanishing vacuum state\nexpectation values due to nonperturbative effects. We speculate that this could\naccount for the existence of a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the\nstress-energy tensor of a quantum field occurring at a scale much smaller than\nthe natural scales of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2008 09:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Also estimated is the relation\nbetween the galaxies and the dark matter distribution exploiting galaxy-galaxy\nlensing (GGL). All observables are further interpreted in terms of a halo\nmodel. To fully explain the galaxy clustering cross-correlation function with a\nhalo model, we need to introduce a new parameter,R, that describes the\nstatistical relation between numbers of red and blue galaxies within the same\nhalo. We find that red and blue galaxies are clearly differently clustered, a\nsignificant evolution of the relative clustering with redshift was not found.\nThere is evidence for a scale-dependence of relative biasing. The relative\nclustering, the GGL and, with some tension, the galaxy numbers can be explained\nconsistently within a halo model.

The disk inclination, which\nsignificantly affect SED modeling, is often unknown. We attempted to resolve\nthe disks around CQ Tau and MWC 758, to provide accurate constraints on the\ndisk parameters, in particular the temperature and surface density\ndistribution. We report arcsecond resolution observations of dust and CO line\nemissions with the IRAM array. The disk properties are derived using a standard\ndisk model. We use the Meudon PDR code to study the chemistry. The two disks\nshare some common properties. The mean CO abundance is low despite disk\ntemperatures above the CO condensation temperature. Furthermore, the CO surface\ndensity and dust opacity have different radial dependence. The CQ Tau disk\nappears warmer, and perhaps less dense than that of MWC 758. Modeling the\nchemistry, we find that photodissociation of CO is a viable mechanism to\nexplain the low abundance. The photospheric flux is not sufficient for this: a\nstrong UV excess is required. In CQ Tau, the high temperature is consistent\nwith expectation for a PDR. The PDR model has difficulty explaining the mild\ntemperatures obtained in MWC 758, for which a low gas-to-dust ratio is\npreferred. A yet unexplored alternative could be that, despite currently high\ngas temperatures, CO remains trapped in grains, as the models suggest that\nlarge grains can be cold enough to prevent thermal desorption of CO. The low\ninclination of the CQ Tau disk, ~30^\\circ, challenges previous interpretations\ngiven for the UX Ori - like luminosity variations of this star. We conclude\nthat CO cannot be used as a simple tracer of gas-to-dust ratio, the CO\nabundance being affected by photodissociation, and grain growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2008 14:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-15"}

From these measurements $\\beta$-factors of up to 0.89\nare derived, and an unprecedented large bandwidth of 20 nm is demonstrated.\nThis shows the promising potential of photonic crystal waveguides for efficient\nsingle-photon sources. The scaled frequency where the enhancement is observed\nis in excellent agreement with theory taking into account that the light-matter\ncoupling is strongly enhanced due to the significant slow-down of light in the\nphotonic crystal waveguide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2008 15:08:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 May 2008 07:48:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2008 09:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-25"}

In order to estimate parameters in\nthis expression, some nucleon additions to nuclei are considered and a model is\nsuggested as a guide of the addition process.
