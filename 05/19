Indeed, we derive generic SR\nequations from a polymer stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (LC) cell,\nwhich is a typical soft matter representative constituting one of the basic\ncomponents in several electro-optic applications. We generalize these equations\nfurther in order to study an even broader class of qualitatively different\nsystems, especially disclosing the influence of different types of static\ndisorder and interaction ranges amongst LC molecules on the SR response. We\ndetermine the required conditions for the observation of SR in the examined\nsystem, and moreover, reveal that a random field type static disorder yields\nqualitatively different responses with respect to random dilution, random bond\nand spin glass universality classes. In particular, while the latter three\ndecrease the level of dynamic disorder (Gaussian noise) warranting the optimal\nresponse, the former evokes exactly the opposite effect, hence increasing the\noptimal noise level that is needed to resonantly fine-tune the system's\nresponse in accordance with the weak deterministic electric field. These\nobservations are shown to be independent of the system size and range of\ninteractions, thus implying their general validity and potentially wide\napplicability also within other similar settings.

In some forms of sensory adaptation, these linear\nfilters and gain curve adjust very rapidly to changes in the variance of a\nrandomly varying driving input. An apparently similar but previously unrelated\nissue is the observation of gain control by background noise in cortical\nneurons: the slope of the firing rate vs current (f-I) curve changes with the\nvariance of background random input. Here, we show a direct correspondence\nbetween these two observations by relating variance-dependent changes in the\ngain of f-I curves to characteristics of the changing empirical\nlinear/nonlinear model obtained by sampling. In the case that the underlying\nsystem is fixed, we derive relationships relating the change of the gain with\nrespect to both mean and variance with the receptive fields derived from\nreverse correlation on a white noise stimulus. Using two conductance-based\nmodel neurons that display distinct gain modulation properties through a simple\nchange in parameters, we show that coding properties of both these models\nquantitatively satisfy the predicted relationships.

The\npricipal idea, that allows us to specify the theory for Pomeron interactions,\nis that the so called soft processes occur at rather short distances\n  ($r^2 \\propto 1 /<p_t>^2 \\propto \\alpha'_\\pom \\approx 0.01 GeV^{-2}$), where\nperturbative QCD is valid. The value of the Pomeron slope $\\alpha'_\\pom $ was\nobtained from the fit to experimental data. Using this theoretical approach we\nsuggest a model that fits all soft data in the ISR-Tevatron energy range, the\ntotal, elastic, single and double diffractive cross sections, including $t$\ndependence of the differential elastic cross section, and the mass dependence\nof single diffraction. In this model we calculate the survival probability of\ndiffractive Higgs production, and obtained a value for this observable, which\nis smaller than 1% at the LHC energy range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2008 07:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 May 2008 08:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Arveson has characterized completely the gauge group of\nE_0-semigroups of type I, and as a consequence it is known that in this case\nthe gauge group action is transitive. In fact, if the semigroup has index k,\nthen the gauge group action is transitive on the set of k+1-tuples of\nappropriately normalized independent units. An action of the gauge group having\nthis property is called k+1-fold transitive.\n  We construct examples of E_0-semigroups of type II and index 1 which are not\n2-fold transitive. These new examples also illustrate that an E_0-semigroup of\ntype II_k need not be a tensor product of an E_0-semigroup of type II_0 and\nanother of type I_k.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2008 09:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-20"}

In the inner jet region of HH34 we\nfind that both the atomic and molecular gas present two components at high and\nlow velocity. The [FeII] LVC in HH34 is detected up to large distances from the\nsource (>1000 AU), at variance with TTauri jets. In H2 2.122um, the LVC and HVC\nare spatially separated. We detect, for the first time, the fainter red-shifted\ncounterpart down to the central source. In HH1, we trace the jet down to ~1\"\nfrom the VLA1 driving source: the kinematics of this inner region is again\ncharacterised by the presence of two velocity components, one blue-shifted and\none red-shifted with respect to the source LSR velocity. In the inner HH34 jet\nregion, ne increases with decreasing velocity. Up to ~10\" from the driving\nsource, and along the whole HH1 jet an opposite behaviour is observed instead,\nwith ne increasing with velocity. In both jets the mass flux is carried mainly\nby the high-velocity gas. A comparison between the position velocity diagrams\nand derived electron densities with models for MHD jet launching mechanisms has\nbeen performed for HH34. While the kinematical characteristics of the line\nemission at the jet base can be, at least qualitatively, reproduced by both\nX-winds and disc-wind models, none of these models can explain the extent of\nthe LVC and the dependence of electron density with velocity that we observe.\nIt is possible that the LVC in HH34 represents gas not directly ejected in the\njet but instead denser ambient gas entrained by the high velocity collimated\njet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2008 11:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The H2S1 narrow-band filter (lambda_c=2.121um) we employ selects the\nH-alpha emission line redshifted to z=2.23, and is thus suitable for selecting\n'typical' star forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei at this epoch. The\npilot study was undertaken in the well studied Cosmological Evolution Survey\nfield (COSMOS) and is already the largest near-infrared narrow-band survey at\nthis depth, with a line flux limit of F(H-alpha)~10^-16 erg/s/cm^2 over 0.60\nsquare degrees, probing ~220x10^3 Mpc^3 (co-moving) down to a limiting star\nformation rate of 30 M_sun/yr (3sigma). In this paper we present the results\nfrom our pilot survey and evaluate the H-alpha luminosity function and estimate\nthe clustering properties of H-alpha emitters at z=2.23 from 55 detected\ngalaxies. The integrated luminosity function is used to estimate the volume\naveraged star formation rate at z=2.23: SFRD = 0.17^{+0.16}_{-0.09}\nM_sun/yr/Mpc^3 for L(H-alpha) > 10^42 erg/s. For the first time, we use the\nH-alpha star-formation tracer to reliably constrain SFRD out to z=2.23\ndemonstrating the rapid increase in SRFD out to this redshift as well as\nconfirming the flattening in SFRD between z~1-2. In addition to the luminosity\ndistribution, we analyse the clustering properties of these galaxies. Using the\n2-point angular correlation function, we estimate a real space correlation\nlength of r_0= 4.2^{+0.4}_{-0.2} h^-1 Mpc.

This work\npresents the properties of the prompt emission of GRB 070707, which is the\nfirst short hard GRB observed by INTEGRAL. The spectral and temporal properties\nof GRB 070707 were determined using the two sensitive coded-mask gamma-ray\ninstruments on board INTEGRAL, IBIS and SPI. The T_90 duration was 0.8s, and\nthe spectrum of the prompt emission was obtained by joint deconvolution of IBIS\nand SPI data to yield a best fit power-law with photon index alpha = -1.19\n+0.14 -0.13, which is consistent with the characteristics of short-hard\ngamma-ray bursts. The peak flux over 1 second was 1.79 photons/cm^2/s and the\nfluence over the same interval was 2.07 x 10^-7 erg/cm^2 in the energy range\n20-200keV. The spectral lag measured between 25-50keV and 100-300keV is 20 +/-\n5ms, consistent with the small or negligible lags measured for short bursts.\nThe spectral and temporal properties of GRB 070707 are comparable to those of\nthe short hard bursts detected by other gamma-ray satellites, including BATSE\nand Swift. We estimate a lower limit on the Lorentz factor Gamma >~ 25 for GRB\n070707, assuming the typical redshift for short GRBs of z=0.35. This limit is\nconsistent with previous estimates for short GRBs and is smaller than the lower\nlimits of Gamma >~ 100 calculated for long GRBs. If GRB 070707 is a member of\nthe recently postulated class of short GRBs at z ~ 1, the lower limit on Gamma\nincreases to Gamma >~ 35.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2008 15:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this paper we show that there are exciting prospects of\ndetecting from the burst by MAGIC high-energy (HE) emission during the early\nX-ray flaring activity and, later, during the normal afterglow phase. We also\nidentify the best observational strategy, trigger conditions and time period of\nobservation. We determine the expected HE emission from the flaring and\nafterglow phases of GRBs in the context of the external shock scenario and\ncompare them with the MAGIC threshold. We find that an X-ray flare with the\naverage properties of the class can be detected in the 100 GeV range by MAGIC,\nprovided that z<0.7. The requested observational window with MAGIC should then\nstart from 10-20 s after the burst and cover about 1000-2000 s. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that there are solid prospects of detecting the late afterglow\nemission in the same energy range for most of the bursts with z<0.5 if the\ndensity of the external medium is n> a few cm^-3. In this case, the MAGIC\nobservation shall extend to about 10-20 ks. We provide recipes for tailoring\nthis prediction to the observational properties of each burst,in particular the\nfluence in the prompt emission and the redshift, thus allowing an almost real\ntime decision procedure to decide whether to continue the follow-up observation\nof a burst at late times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2008 15:17:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 18:17:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
