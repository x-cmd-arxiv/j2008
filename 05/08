Only three BL Lacs are known so\nfar to contain a kpc-scale X-ray jet. In this paper, we present the evidence\nfor the existence of a fourth extended X-ray jet in the classical\nradio-selected source S5 2007+777, which for its hybrid FRI/II radio morphology\nhas been classified as a HYMOR (HYbrid MOrphology Radio source). Our Chandra\nACIS-S observations of this source revealed an X-ray counterpart to the\n19\"-long radio jet. Interestingly, the X-ray properties of the kpc-scale jet in\nS5 2007+777 are very similar to those observed in FRII jets. First, the X-ray\nmorphology closely mirrors the radio one, with the X-rays being concentrated in\nthe discrete radio knots. Second, the X-ray continuum of the jet/brightest knot\nis described by a very hard power law, with photon index Gamma_x~1, although\nthe uncertainties are large. Third, the optical upper limit from archival HST\ndata implies a concave radio-to-X-ray SED. If the X-ray emission is attributed\nto IC/CMB with equipartition, strong beaming (delta=13) is required, implying a\nvery large scale (Mpc) jet. The beaming requirement can be somewhat relaxed\nassuming a magnetic field lower than equipartition. Alternatively, synchrotron\nemission from a second population of very high-energy electrons is viable.\nComparison to other HYMOR jets detected with Chandra is discussed, as well as\ngeneral implications for the origin of the FRI/II division.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2008 16:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-08"}

Solving this puzzle now requires not only matching the\nnumbers of objects but also understanding the details of their star formation\nhistories. We present a summary of such histories derived from the HST data\nusing the color-magnitude diagram fitting method. To reduce observational\nuncertainties, we condense the data into five cumulative parameters -- the\nfractions of stellar mass formed in the last 1, 2, 5, and 10 Gyr, and the mean\nstellar age.

The model correctly predicts the radial distribution of the dwarfs\nand the fractions of stars formed in the last 5 and 10 Gyr. However, in order\nto be consistent with the observations, the model requires a significant amount\nof recent star formation in the last 2 Gyr. Within the framework of our model,\nthis prolonged star formation can be achieved by adding a stochastic variation\nin the density threshold of the star formation law. The model results are not\nsensitive to late gas accretion, the slope of the Schmidt law, or the details\nof cosmic reionization.

Our spectra\nallow us to derive a significant number of new rotational velocities, and\ndiscover a slowly rotating (in projected velocity) L dwarf that allows more\naccurate measurement of spectroscopic rotations for these objects. We measure\nchromospheric activity (and often its variability) through the H$\\alpha$\nemission line. Our primary new result is good evidence that magnetic braking\ndominates the angular momentum evolution of even brown dwarfs, although\nspindown times appear to increase as mass decreases. We confirm that activity\ndecreases as effective temperature decreases, though a larger fraction of L\ndwarfs are active than has previously been reported. Essentially all active\nobjects are also variable. We confirm the lack of a rotation-activity\nconnection for L dwarfs. We find a minimum limit for rotational velocities that\nincreases with later spectral types, rising from near zero in older mid-M stars\nto more than 20 km s$^{-1}$ for mid-L objects.

Comparison to\ndynamical masses estimated from the NH_3 survey of Perseus cores by Rosolowsky\net al.

However, very wide or very close binaries\ncan also produce double-peaked high-magnification events, with the same gross\nproperties as those produced by planets. Traditionally, distinguishing between\nthese two interpretations has relied upon detailed modeling, which is both\ntime-consuming and generally does not provide insight into the observable\nproperties that allow discrimination between these two classes of models. We\nstudy the morphologies of these two classes of double-peaked high-magnification\nevents, and identify a simple diagnostic that can be used to immediately\ndistinguish between perturbations caused by planetary and binary companions,\nwithout detailed modeling. This diagnostic is based on the difference in the\nshape of the intra-peak region of the light curves. The shape is smooth and\nconcave for binary lensing, while it tends to be either boxy or convex for\nplanetary lensing. In planetary lensing this intra-peak morphology is due to\nthe small, weak cusp of the planetary central caustic located between the two\nstronger cusps. We apply this diagnostic to five observed double-peaked\nhigh-magnification events to infer their underlying nature. A corollary of our\nstudy is that good coverage of the intra-peak region of double-peaked\nhigh-magnification events is likely to be important for their unique\ninterpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2008 05:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The \"ladder\" to go between the\nphysics in 5D and 4D is provided by Campbell-Maagard's embedding theorems. We\nshow that the 5-dimensional field equations $R_{AB} = 0$ determine the form of\nthe similarity variable. There are three different possibilities: homothetic,\nconformal and \"wave-like\" solutions in 5D. We derive the most general\nhomothetic and conformal solutions to the 5D field equations. They require the\nextra dimension to be spacelike, and are given in terms of one arbitrary\nfunction of the similarity variable and three parameters. The Riemann tensor in\n5D is not zero, except in the isotropic limit, which corresponds to the case\nwhere the parameters are equal to each other. The solutions can be used as 5D\nembeddings for a great variety of 4D homogeneous cosmological models, with and\nwithout matter, including the Kasner universe. Since the extra dimension is\nspacelike, the 5D solutions are invariant under the exchange of spatial\ncoordinates. Therefore they also embed a family of spatially {\\it\ninhomogeneous} models in 4D.

We propose\nthat this observation can be explained using a binary model that involve mass\ntransfer from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star companion and, based on\nthis model, we predict F abundances in CEMP stars in general. We discuss wether\nF can be used to discriminate between the formation histories of most CEMP\nstars: via binary mass transfer or from the ejecta of fast-rotating massive\nstars. We compute AGB yields using different stellar evolution and\nnucleosynthesis codes to evaluate stellar model uncertainties. We use a simple\ndilution model to determine the factor by which the AGB yields should be\ndiluted to match the abundances observed in HE 1305+0132. We further employ a\nbinary population synthesis tool to estimate the probability of F-rich CEMP\nstars. The abundances observed in HE 1305+0132 can be explained if this star\naccreted 3-11% of the mass lost by its former AGB companion. The primary AGB\nstar should have dredged-up at least 0.2 Msun of material from its He-rich\nregion into the convective envelope via third dredge-up, which corresponds to\nAGB models of Z ~ 0.0001 and mass ~ 2 Msun. Many AGB model uncertainties, such\nas the treatment of convective borders and mass loss, require further\ninvestigation. We find that in the binary scenario most CEMP stars should also\nbe FEMP stars, that is, have [F/Fe] > +1, while fast-rotating massive stars do\nnot appear to produce fluorine. We conclude that fluorine is a signature of\nlow-mass AGB pollution in CEMP stars, together with elements associated with\nthe slow neutron-capture process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2008 08:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

By\ncombining the centimetre radio data with the wealth of shorter wavelength data\naccumulated recently we wish to refine estimates of the evolutionary stages of\nthe YSOs. Fluxes and spectral indices for the brightest radio sources were\nderived from the observations at 3, 6, and 20 cm using the ATCA. Seven of\ndetected sources can be assigned to YSOs, which have counterparts in the\nX-rays, infrared or submm. One of the YSOs, Radio Source 9, is a Class 0\ncandidate, and another, IRS 7B, is suggested to be in the Class 0/I transition\nstage. IRS 7B is associated with extended radio lobes at 6 and 20 cm. The lobes\nmay have a gyrosynchrotron emission component, which could be understood in\nterms of Fermi accleration in shocks. The Class I objects detected here seem to\nbe a mixed lot. One of these, the wide binary IRS 5, shows a negative spectral\nindex, rapid variability, and a high degree of circular polarisation with\n$V/I\\approx33$ % on one of the days of observation. These signs of magnetic\nactivity suggest that at least one of the binary components has advanced beyond\nthe Class I stage. The radio source without YSO assigment, Radio Source 5, has\nbeen suggested to be a brown dwarf. The radio properties, in particular its\npersistent strong emission, do not support this classification. The radio\ncharacteristics of the detected YSOs roughly agree with the scheme where the\ndominant emission mechanism changes with age. The heterogeneity of the Class I\ngroup can possibly be explained by a drastic decline in the jet activity during\nthis stage, which also changes the efficiency of free-free absorption around\nthe protostar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2008 09:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The mixing even increases with\ntemperature and leads to an interchange of the roles of the originally heavy,\npredominantly quarkonium state and the originally light, predominantly\ntetraquark state. Then, as expected, the scalar quarkonium is a light state\nwhen becoming degenerate in mass with the pion as chiral symmetry is restored\nat nonzero temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2008 10:30:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 May 2008 14:19:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 15:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nexistence of this structure, which has probably formed and survived for several\nGigayears, confirms that halos of spiral galaxies in the Local Universe may\nstill contain a significant number of galactic fossils from their hierarchical\nformation. To examine the validity of the external accretion scenario, we\npresent N-body simulations of the tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy-like\nsystem in a disk galaxy plus dark halo potential that demonstrate that most of\nthe observed tidal features observed in NGC 5907 can be explained by a single\naccretion event. Unfortunately, with no kinematic data and only the projected\ngeometry of the stream as constraint, the parameters of our model are\nconsiderably degenerate and, for now, must be considered illustrative only.\nInterestingly, NGC 5907 has long been considered a prototypical example of a\nwarped spiral in relative isolation. The presence of an extended tidal stream\nchallenges this picture and suggests that the gravitational perturbations\ninduced by the stream progenitor may be the cause for the warp. The detection\nof an old, complex tidal stream in a nearby galaxy with rather modest\ninstrumentation points to the viability of surveys to find extragalactic tidal\nsubstructures around spiral galaxies in the Local Volume (< 15 Mpc) -- with the\nprospect of obtaining a census with enough statistical significance to be\ncompared with cosmological simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2008 11:22:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2008 08:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Ghost imaging is one of such phenomena. Two types of ghost\nimaging have been experimentally demonstrated since 1995. Type-one ghost\nimaging uses entangled photon pairs as the light source. The nonlocal\npoint-to-point image-forming correlation is the result of a\nconstructive-destructive superposition among a large number of biphoton\namplitudes, a nonclassical entity corresponding to different yet\nindistinguishable alternative ways of producing a joint-detction event between\ndistant photodetectors. Type-two ghost imaging uses chaotic-thermal light. The\ntype-two image-forming correlation is the result of interferences between\npaired two-photon amplitudes, corresponding to two different yet\nindistinguishable alternative ways of triggering a join-detection event by two\nindependent photons. A great deal of confusion about ghost imaging comes from\n\"ghost shadow\". Similar to x-ray photography, a ghost shadow can be made in\ncoincidences by \"blocking-partial blocking-unblocking\" of either co-rotating\nlaser beams or classically correlated \"speckles\". \"Ghost shadow\" is indeed a\nclassical phenomenon.

Experiments to measure Casimir force have been carried out since the\n1950s.

The details of the construction of the torsion\nbalance apparatus, the experimental procedure and the analysis to obtain the\nCasimir force as a function of separation are described.
