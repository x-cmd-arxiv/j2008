A growing number of systems are reported to be in\nresonance, which is thought to arise from the planet migration process. If\nplanets are brought together and moved inward through torques produced by\ncircumstellar disks, then disk turbulence can act to prevent planets from\nstaying in a resonant configuration. This paper studies this process through\nnumerical simulations and via analytic model equations, where both approaches\ninclude stochastic forcing terms due to turbulence. We explore how the\namplitude and forcing time intervals of the turbulence affect the maintenance\nof mean motion resonances. If turbulence is common in circumstellar disks\nduring the epoch of planet migration, with the amplitudes indicated by current\nMHD simulations, then planetary systems that remain deep in mean motion\nresonance are predicted to be rare. More specifically, the fraction of resonant\nsystems that survive over a typical disk lifetime of 1 Myr is of order 0.01. If\nmean motion resonances are found to be common, their existence would place\ntight constraints on the amplitude and duty cycle of turbulent fluctuations in\ncircumstellar disks. These results can be combined by expressing the expected\nfraction of surviving resonant systems in the approximate form P_b = C /\nN_{orb}^{1/2}, where the dimensionless parameter C = 10 - 50 and where N_{orb}\nis the number of orbits for which turbulence is active.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2008 16:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-13"}

The dynamics of\nthe maximum, located at the mean value of position, is governed by the\nNewtonian equation of the corresponding classical problem. The width, which is\ndirectly proportional to the position uncertainty, obeys a complex nonlinear\nRiccati equation which can be transformed into a real nonlinear Ermakov\nequation. The coupled pair of these equations yields a dynamical invariant\nwhich plays a key role in our investigation. It can be expressed in terms of a\ncomplex variable that linearizes the Riccati equation. This variable also\nprovides the time-dependent parameters that characterize the Green's function,\nor Feynman kernel, of the corresponding problem. From there, also the relation\nbetween the classical and quantum dynamics of the systems can be obtained.\nFurthermore, the close connection between the Ermakov invariant and the Wigner\nfunction will be shown. Factorization of the dynamical invariant allows for\ncomparison with creation/annihilation operators and supersymmetry where the\npartner potentials fulfil (real) Riccati equations. This provides the link to a\nnonlinear formulation of time-independent quantum mechanics in terms of an\nErmakov equation for the amplitude of the stationary state wave functions\ncombined with a conservation law. Comparison with SUSY and the time-dependent\nproblems concludes our analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2008 17:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-13"}

Our method consists in measuring the relation\nbetween the cosmological velocity and gravity fields, and thus requires\npeculiar velocity measurements. The relation is measured *directly in redshift\nspace*, so there is no need to reconstruct the density field in real space. In\nlinear theory, the radial components of the gravity and velocity fields in\nredshift space are expected to be tightly correlated, with a slope given, in\nthe distant observer approximation, by g / v = (1 + 6 beta / 5 + 3 beta^2 /\n7)^(1/2) / beta. We test extensively this relation using controlled numerical\nexperiments based on a cosmological N-body simulation. To perform the\nmeasurements, we propose a new and rather simple adaptive interpolation scheme\nto estimate the velocity and the gravity field on a grid. One of the most\nstriking results is that nonlinear effects, including `fingers of God', affect\nmainly the tails of the joint probability distribution function (PDF) of the\nvelocity and gravity field: the 1--1.5 sigma region around the maximum of the\nPDF is *dominated by the linear theory regime*, both in real and redshift\nspace.

The\npotential energy surfaces for interaction of NH3 with alkali-metal and\nalkaline-earth atoms all show deep potential wells and strong anisotropies. The\nwell depths vary from 887 1/cm for Mg-NH3 to 5104 1/cm for Li-NH3. This\nsuggests that all these systems will exhibit strong inelasticity whenever\ninelastic collisions are energetically allowed and that sympathetic cooling\nwill work only when both the atoms and the molecules are already in their\nlowest internal states. Xe-NH3 is more weakly bound and less anisotropic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2008 18:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-09"}

Phenomenological\nsimilarities between the two approaches are studied by looking for properties\npredicted in one framework that are also reproducible in the other one. First,\nwe looked for the analogous of the URC within the MOND framework. Modifying in\nan observationally-based way the baryonic contribution Vbar to the rotation\ncurve predicted by the URC, and applying the MOND formulas to this Vbar, leads\nto a \"MOND URC\" whose properties are remarkably similar to the URC. Second, it\nis shown that the URC predicts a tight mass discrepancy - acceleration\nrelation, which is a natural outcome of MOND. With the choice of Vbar that\nminimises the differences between the URC and the \"MOND URC\" the relation is\nalmost identical to the observational one. This similarity between the\nobservational properties of MOND and the URC has no implications about the\nvalidity of MOND as a theory of gravity, but it shows that it can reproduce in\ndetail the phenomenology of disk galaxies' rotation curves, as described by the\nURC. MOND and the URC, even though they are based on totally different\nassumptions, are found to have very similar behaviours and to be able to\nreproduce each other's properties fairly well, even with the simple assumptions\nmade on the luminosity dependence of the baryonic contribution to the rotation\ncurve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2008 11:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We factor in variations in atmospheric opacity, the presence of an\ninner heavy-element core, and possible heating due to orbital tidal\ndissipation. A small, yet non-zero, degree of core heating is needed to explain\nthe observed radius of TrES-4, unless its atmospheric opacity is significantly\nlarger than a value equivalent to that at 10$\\times$solar metallicity with\nequilibrium molecular abundances. This heating rate is reasonable, and\ncorresponds for an energy dissipation parameter ($Q_p$) of $\\sim10^{3.8}$ to an\neccentricity of $\\sim$0.01, assuming 3$\\times$solar atmospheric opacity and a\nheavy-element core of $M_c = 30$ $M_{\\oplus}$. For XO-3b, which has an observed\norbital eccentricity of 0.26, we show that tidal heating needs to be taken into\naccount to explain its observed radius. Furthermore, we reexamine the core mass\nneeded for HAT-P-1b in light of new measurements and find that it now generally\nfollows the correlation between stellar metallicity and core mass suggested\nrecently.

In the first three kinds of\nsimulations there is a spherical bubble of comoving radius R_b, the one that we\nare trying to detect, located at the center, and the neutral hydrogen (HI)\noutside the bubble traces the underlying dark matter distribution. We consider\nthree different possible scenarios of reionization, i.e., (i) there is a single\nbubble (SB) in the field of view (FoV) and the hydrogen neutral fraction is\nconstant outside this bubble (ii) patchy reionization with many small ionized\nbubbles in the FoV (PR1) and (iii) many spherical ionized bubbles of the same\nradius $R_b$ (PR2). The fourth kind of simulation uses more realistic maps\nbased on semi-numeric modelling (SM) of ionized regions. We find that for both\nthe SB and PR1 scenarios the fluctuating IGM restricts bubble detection to size\nR_b<= 6 Mpc and R_b<= 12 Mpc for the GMRT and the MWA respectively, however\nlarge be the integration time.

The essential\nrequirement for the detection of such planets in these events is that the FWHM\nof the light curve be monitored continuously, or as nearly continuously as\npossible. The dependence of planet detectability on the magnification caused by\nmicrolensing, on the planet mass and planet location, and on the size of the\nsource star, may be understood in terms of simple geometrical properties of\nmicrolensing that have been known since 1964. Planetary signals of low-mass\nplanets are found to be approximately independent of the magnification caused\nby microlensing. This implies that planets can be detected in events over a\nwide range of magnifications, from moderately high values ~ 100 to very high\nvalues ~ 1000. The former values are likely to yield more clear-cut separations\nof the stellar and planetary features on the light curve, but they require\nlarger telescopes to obtain precision photometry.

We\nthen recapitulate as to why the Copenhagen interpretation of the quantum\nmechanics had to renounce most of the attractive features of the clasical world\nview such as a causal description, locality, scientific realism and introduce a\nfundamental distinction between system and apparatus. The crucial role is\nplayed in this by the Bohr's insistence on the wavefunction providing the most\ncomplete description possible for an even individual system. The alternative of\nintroducing extra dynamical variables, called hidden variables, in addition to\nthe wavefunction of the system so as to be able to retain at least some of the\ndesirable features of classical physics, is then explored. The first such\nsuccessful attempt was that of Bohm in 1952 who showed that a realistic\ninterpretation of the quantum mechanics can be given which maintains a causal\ndescription as well as does not treat systems and measuring appeartus\ndifferently. We begin with the construction of the Bohm's theory. He introduces\nparticle positions as the hidden variables. The particle positions play a\nspecial role in Bohm theory. The particle trajectories are guided by the\nwavefunction. The Bohm theory is deterministic. The probability enters through\na special assumption, ``quantum equilibrium'' hypothesis, for the initial\nconditions on the ensemble of particle trajectories. The ``wave or particle''\ndilemma is resolved by a ``wave and particle'' resolution. The measurements in\nBohm theory can be described without mysticism.

In the current paper, we investigate the\ndependence of the helicity bound on the boundary condition for several families\nof nonlinear force-free fields. Our calculation shows that the magnitude of the\nhelicity upper bound of force-free fields is non-trivially dependent on the\nboundary condition. Fields with a multipolar boundary condition can have a\nhelicity upper bound ten times smaller than those with a dipolar boundary\ncondition when helicity values are normalized by the square of their respective\nsurface poloidal fluxes. This suggests that a coronal magnetic field may erupt\ninto a CME when the applicable helicity bound falls below the already\naccumulated helicity as the result of a slowly changing boundary condition. Our\ncalculation also shows that a monotonic accumulation of magnetic helicity can\nlead to the formation of a magnetic flux rope applicable to kink instability.\nThis suggests that CME initiations by exceeding helicity bound and by kink\ninstability can both be the consequences of helicity accumulation in the\ncorona. Our study gives insights into the observed associations of CMEs with\nthe magnetic features at their solar surface origins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2008 06:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The inflaton field\nis assumed to decay into normal matter only, while the dark matter is injected\ninto the brane from the bulk. To describe the reheating process we adopt a\nphenomenological approach, by describing the decay of the inflaton field by a\nfriction term proportional to the energy density of the field. After the\nradiation dominated epoch the model reduces to the standard four dimensional\ncosmological model. The modified field equations are analyzed analytically and\nnumerically in both the extra-dimensions dominate reheating phase (when the\nquadratic terms in energy density dominate the dynamics), and in the general\ncase. The evolution profiles of the matter, of the scalar field and of the\nscale factor of the universe are obtained for different values of the\nparameters of the model, and of the equations of state of the normal and dark\nmatter, respectively. The equation describing the time evolution of the ratio\nof the energy density of the dark and of the normal matter is also obtained.\nThe ratio depends on the rate of the energy flow between the bulk and the\nbrane. The observational constraint of an approximately constant ratio of the\ndark and of the baryonic matter requires that the dark matter must be\nnon-relativistic (cold). The model predicts a reheating temperature of the\norder of $3\\times 10^6$ GeV, a brane tension of the order of $10^{25}$ GeV$^4$,\nand the obtained composition of the universe is consistent with the\nobservational data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2008 07:14:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 04:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-18"}

There is a growing consensus that these events likely stem from\nperiastron passage of an (as yet) unseen companion in a highly eccentric\n($\\epsilon \\sim 0.9$) orbit. This paper presents three-dimensional (3-D)\nSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the orbital variation of\nthe binary wind-wind collision, and applies these to modeling the X-ray light\ncurve observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). By providing a global\n3-D model of the phase variation of the density of the interacting winds, the\nsimulations allow computation of the associated variation in X-ray absorption,\npresumed here to originate from near the apex of the wind-wind interaction\ncone. We find that the observed RXTE light curve can be readily fit if the\nobserver's line of sight is within this cone along the general direction of\napastron. Specifically, the data are well fit by an assumed inclination $i =\n45^{\\circ}$ for the orbit's polar axis, which is thus consistent with orbital\nangular momentum being along the inferred polar axis of the Homunculus nebula.\nThe fits also constrain the position angle $\\phi$ that an orbital-plane\nprojection makes with the apastron side of the semi-major axis, strongly\nexcluding positions $\\phi < 9^{\\circ}$ along or to the retrograde side of the\naxis, with the best fit position given by $\\phi = 27^{\\circ}$.

Additional constraints have been used from direct\nmeasurements or upper limits on the extragalactic backgrounds by dedicated\nmissions (COBE). All data were fitted and interpolated with a multi-wavelength\nbackward evolutionary model, allowing us to estimate the background photon\ndensity and its redshift evolution. From the redshift-dependent background\nspectrum, the photon-photon opacities for sources of high-energy emission at\nany redshifts were then computed. The same results can also be used to compute\nthe optical depths for any kind of processes in the intergalactic space\ninvolving interactions with background photons (like scattering of cosmic-ray\nparticles). We have applied our photon-photon opacity estimates to the analysis\nof spectral data at TeV energies on a few BLAZARs of particular interest.\n[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2008 12:58:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 13:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-01"}

In\nparticular, we explore the sensitivity of the element creation in the A>130\nregion to the low-temperature behavior of the outflows. For this purpose we\nemploy a simplified model of the dynamics and thermodynamical evolution for\nradiation dominated, adiabatic outflows. It consists of a first stage of fast,\nexponential cooling, followed by a second phase of slower evolution, either\nassuming constant density and temperature or a power-law decay of these\nquantities. These cases are supposed to capture the most relevant effects of a\nstrong deceleration or decreasing acceleration of the transsonic outflows,\nrespectively, e.g. in a wind termination shock caused by the collision with the\nslower, preceding supernova ejecta. We find that not only the transition\ntemperature between the two expansion phases can make a big difference in the\nformation of the platinum peak, but also the detailed cooling law during the\nlater phase. Unless the transition temperature and corresponding (free neutron)\ndensity become too small (T < 2*10^8 K), a lower temperature or faster\ntemperature decline during this phase allow for a stronger appearance of the\nthird abundance peak. Since the nuclear photodisintegration rates between\n~2*10^8 K and ~10^9 K are more sensitive to the temperature than the n-capture\nrates are to the free neutron density, a faster cooling in this temperature\nregime shifts the r-process path closer to the n-drip line. With low (gamma,n)-\nbut high beta-decay rates, the r-processing then does not proceed through a\n(gamma,n)-(n,gamma) equilibrium but through a quasi-equilibrium of\n(n,gamma)-reactions and beta-decays, as recently also pointed out by Wanajo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2008 13:28:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2008 19:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

To describe this process we introduce a distorted-wave\nmethod, based on the use of the eikonal wave function, which takes into account\nthe phase of the scattering state along the classical projectile path. The\neikonal theory is applied to evaluate the angular distribution of few keV\nhelium atoms after impinging on a LiF(001) surface along low-index\ncrystallographic directions. The interest focuses on the role played by the\nprojectile polarization produced by cations and anions of the crystal surface.\nFor the considered collision system we found a polarization channel,\ncorresponding to the direction <110>, which is affected by this effect, while\nfor incidence in the direction <100> the polarization contribution is nearly\nnegligible. The proposed eikonal approach, including polarization effects,\nprovides angular projectile spectra in good agreement with the experimental\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2008 15:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2008 21:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
