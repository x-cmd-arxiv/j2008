Thanks to Moore's law, the bandwidth up to which this is feasible has\nnow reached about 1 GHz, and will likely continue doubling every couple of\nyears. The main advantages over a single dish telescope are cost and orders of\nmagnitude larger field-of-view, translating into dramatically better\nsensitivity for large-area surveys. The key advantages over traditional\ninterferometers are cost (the correlator computational cost for an N-element\narray scales as N log N rather than N^2) and a compact synthesized beam. We\nargue that 21 cm tomography could be an ideal first application of a very large\nFast Fourier Transform Telescope, which would provide both massive sensitivity\nimprovements per dollar and mitigate the off-beam point source foreground\nproblem with its clean beam.

We\ninclude a self-consistent treatment of subhalo boost factors, motivated by our\nnumerical results, and a realistic treatment of the expected backgrounds that\nindividual subhalos must outshine. We show that for reasonable values of the\ndark matter particle physics parameters (M_X ~ 50 - 500 GeV and <sigma*v> ~\n10^-26 - 10^-25 cm^3/s) GLAST may very well discover a few, even up to several\ndozen, such subhalos, at 5 sigma significance, and some at more than 20 sigma.\nWe predict that the majority of luminous sources would be resolved with GLAST's\nexpected angular resolution. For most observer locations the angular\ndistribution of detectable subhalos is consistent with a uniform distribution\nacross the sky. The brightest subhalos tend to be massive (median Vmax of 24\nkm/s) and therefore likely hosts of dwarf galaxies, but many subhalos with Vmax\nas low as 5 km/s are also visible. Typically detectable subhalos are 20 - 40\nkpc from the observer, and only a small fraction are closer than 10 kpc.

Two phenomenological models for\nthe proper time dependence of the parton hard momentum scale, p_hard, and the\nplasma anisotropy parameter, xi, are constructed which describe the transition\nof the plasma from its initial non-equilibrium state to an isotropic\nthermalized state. The first model constructed interpolates between 1+1\ndimensional free streaming at early times and 1+1 dimensional ideal\nhydrodynamical expansion at late times. In the second model we include the\neffect of collisional broadening of the parton distribution functions in the\nearly-time pre-equilibrium stage of plasma evolution.

In this Letter we show that the burst oscillations of this source are\ncoherent with the persistent pulsations, to the level where they track all of\nthe observed fluctuations. Only one burst, which occurs at the lowest accretion\nrates, shows a significant phase offset.

Wandering of the fuel impact hot spot around a fixed\nmagnetic pole seems the most likely cause for the accretion-powered pulse phase\nvariations. This means that the burst asymmetry is coupled to the hot spot, not\nthe magnetic pole. If premature ignition at this point (due to higher local\ntemperatures) triggers a burning front that stalls before spreading over the\nentire surface, the resulting localized nuclear hot spot may explain the\nunusual burst and burst oscillation properties of this source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2008 19:51:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2008 19:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2008 08:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Using 3-D numerical simulations we focus on the\nhydrodynamics of multiple outflows interacting within a parsec scale volume. We\nexplore the extent to which transient outflows injecting directed energy and\nmomentum into a sub-volume of a molecular cloud can be converted into random\nturbulent motions. We show that turbulence can readily be sustained by these\ninteractions and show that it is possible to broadly characterize an effective\ndriving scale of the outflows. We compare the velocity spectrum obtained in our\nstudies to that of isotropically forced hydrodynamic turbulence finding that in\noutflow driven turbulence a power law is indeed achieved. However we find a\nsteeper spectrum (beta ~ 3) is obtained in outflow driven turbulence models\nthan in isotropically forced simulations (beta ~ 2). We discuss possible\nphysical mechanisms responsible for these results as well and their\nimplications for turbulence in molecular clouds where outflows will act in\nconcert with other processes such as gravitational collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2008 00:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

To do this, we define a\n\\emph{Universal White-Box Property (UWBP)}, which if satisfied, would imply\nthat under \\emph{whatever} specification we conceive, the WBP is satisfied.

When the wave function of the system\nis expanded over a sufficiently large set of HH basis functions, containing or\nnot correlation factors, quite accurate results can be obtained for the\nobservables of interest. In this paper, the main aspects of the method are\ndiscussed together with its application to the A=3 and 4 nuclear bound and\nzero-energy scattering states. Results for a variety of nucleon-nucleon (NN)\nand three-nucleon (3N) local or non-local interactions are reported. In\nparticular, NN and 3N interactions derived in the framework of the chiral\neffective field theory and NN potentials from which the high momentum\ncomponents have been removed, as recently presented in the literature, are\nconsidered for the first time within the context of the HH method. The purpose\nof this paper is two-fold. First, to present a complete description of the HH\nmethod for bound and scattering states, including also detailed formulas for\nthe computation of the matrix elements of the NN and 3N interactions. Second,\nto report accurate results for bound and zero-energy scattering states obtained\nwith the most commonly used interaction models. These results can be useful for\ncomparison with those obtained by other techniques and are a significant test\nfor different future approaches to such problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2008 07:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The octave Yin-Yang-algebra is considered as the pre-code or as the\nmodel of the GC. From the viewpoint of this algebraic model, for example, the\nsets of 20 amino acids and of 64 triplets consist of sub-sets of \"male\",\n\"female\" and \"androgynous\" molecules, etc. This algebra permits to reveal\nhidden peculiarities of the structure and evolution of the GC and to propose\nthe conception of \"sexual\" relationships among genetic molecules. The first\nresults of the analysis of the GC systems from such algebraic viewpoint say\nabout the close connection between evolution of the GC and this algebra. They\ninclude 8 evolutionary rules of the dialects of the GC. The evolution of the GC\nis appeared as the struggle between male and female beginnings. The hypothesis\nabout new biophysical factor of \"sexual\" interactions among genetic molecules\nis put forward. The matrix forms of presentation of elements of the genetic\noctave Yin-Yang-algebra are connected with Hadamard matrices by means of the\nsimple U-algorithm. Hadamard matrices play a significant role in the theory of\nquantum computers, in particular. It gives new opportunities for possible\nunderstanding the GC systems as quantum computer systems.

We observe that when an\nimposed time is normalized by a dominating relaxation time of the system, the\nrheological response at different ages shows superposition. Analysis of this\nbehavior suggests that the structural evolution with age under a deformation\nfield, as represented by the dependence of dominant relaxation mode on age,\nbecomes weaker as the system becomes progressively less homogeneous due to\nenhanced attractive interactions caused by addition of salt. Creep-recovery\nbehavior at same elastic modulus shows more viscous dissipation for a system\nhaving more salt, demonstrating increase in the mechanical fragility. This\nstudy shows that an increase in the concentration of salt, which enhances\nattractive interactions and causes greater inhomogeneity, leads to a state\nwherein the particles are held together by weaker interactions. This work leads\nto important insights into how microstructure affects the ageing dynamics.

For this purpose we use the rate equation\nresulting from a generalized mean field approach. A well-known technique for\ngrowing surfaces at the atomic scale is molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Another\napproach is the pulsed laser deposition method (PLD). The main difference\nbetween MBE and PLD is that in the case of MBE we have a continuous rate of\ndeposition $F$ of adatoms on the surface whereas in the case of PLD the adatoms\nare deposited during a pulse of a laser which is very short in comparison to\nthe time span $T$ between the pulses. The generalized mean field theory is a\nuseful model for both MBE and PLD with the most simple approximation,\npoint-like island. We show that the parameter $T$ distinguishes the MBE regime\nfrom the PLD regime. We solve the rate equation for the PLD regime. We consider\nthe time evolution of the density of immobile islands.
