The duality\nbetween the Heterotic and F-theory is a powerful tool in gaining more insights\ninto F-theory description of low-energy chiral multiplets. Because chiral\nmultiplets from bundles /\\^2 V and /\\^2 V^x as well as those from a bundle V\nare all involved in Yukawa couplings in Heterotic compactification, we need to\ntranslate descriptions of all those kinds of matter multiplets into F-theory\nlanguage through the duality. We find that chiral matter multiplets in F-theory\nare global holomorphic sections of line bundles on what we call covering matter\ncurves. The covering matter curves are formulated in Heterotic theory in\nassociation with normalization of spectral surface, while they are where\nM2-branes wrapped on a vanishing two-cycle propagate in F-theory. Chirality\nformulae are given purely in terms of (possibly primitive) four-form flux. In\norder to complete the translation, the dictionary of the Heterotic--F theory\nduality has to be refined in some aspects. A precise map of spectral surface\nand complex structure moduli is obtained, and with the map, we find that\ndivisors specifying the line bundles correspond precisely to codimension-3\nsingularities in F-theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2008 19:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 May 2008 13:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 11:17:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 14:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-14"}

In both the\nmodel and the SDSS group catalogs, we find that at fixed luminosity or stellar\nmass, central galaxies tend to be bluer than satellites. In contrast, at fixed\ngroup richness or halo mass, central galaxies tend to be redder than\nsatellites, and galaxy colors become redder with increasing mass.

In this arrangement, a diamond anvil\nhigh-pressure cell (DAC) containing a microscopic sample of typical diameter\n~50-100 micrometer, is mounted on a precision X-Y nanomotor stage that forms\npart of an IR laser heating optical assembly. Automation of this stage has been\naccomplished using a LabVIEW virtual instrument program to manipulate the X and\nY stages using nanopositioning systems. This has a major feature of enabling a\nrastered heating of the sample over a user-defined circular area, without any\noperator intervention in addition to a virtual joystick to position the sample\nwith respect to the laser spot. This auto-rastering feature has the advantage\nof offering uniform exposure of a circular area of the sample to the incident\nheating laser beam apart from drastic reduction in scan time compared to a\nmanual scan. The diameter of the circle can be varied from a maximum of ~24 mm\ndown to the focal spot size of the laser (~few micrometers), enabling thereby\nusage of the laser heating arrangement for heating microscopic samples under\nhigh-pressure in a DAC, as well as bulk samples at atmospheric pressure.\nExamples for both macro and micro scale automated laser-heating experiments\nhave been presented. In particular, at the micro scale, auto-raster heated\ncarbon samples at ~ 17 GPa and ~2000 K showed excellent signatures of diamond\nformation compared to manually raster heated samples, highlighting the unique\nadvantage of auto-raster heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2008 21:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-12"}

Reversibility is essential for Quantum Computing. This paper\nexamines the testability of Reversible Iterative Logic Arrays (ILAs) composed\nof reversible k-CNOT gates.

The\nmismatched decoding model is well-defined for finite, yet arbitrary, block\nlengths, and naturally captures the channel memory among the bits belonging to\nthe same symbol. We give two independent proofs of the achievability of the\nBICM capacity calculated by Caire et al. where BICM was modeled as a set of\nindependent parallel binary-input channels whose output is the bitwise\nlog-likelihood ratio. Our first achievability proof uses typical sequences, and\nshows that due to the random coding construction, the interleaver is not\nrequired. The second proof is based on the random coding error exponents with\nmismatched decoding, where the largest achievable rate is the generalized\nmutual information. We show that the generalized mutual information of the\nmismatched decoder coincides with the infinite-interleaver BICM capacity. We\nalso show that the error exponent -and hence the cutoff rate- of the BICM\nmismatched decoder is upper bounded by that of coded modulation and may thus be\nlower than in the infinite-interleaved model. We also consider the mutual\ninformation appearing in the analysis of iterative decoding of BICM with EXIT\ncharts. We show that the corresponding symbol metric has knowledge of the\ntransmitted symbol and the EXIT mutual information admits a representation as a\npseudo-generalized mutual information, which is in general not achievable. A\ndifferent symbol decoding metric, for which the extrinsic side information\nrefers to the hypothesized symbol, induces a generalized mutual information\nlower than the coded modulation capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2008 11:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-12"}

Accordingly, all geometric objects defined in\nthis geometry are not only functions of the positional argument $x$, but also\ndepend on the directional argument $y$. Moreover, many new geometric objects,\nwhich have no counterpart in the classical AP-geometry, emerge in this\ndifferent framework. We refer to such a geometry as an Extended Absolute\nParallelism (EAP-) geometry. The building blocks of the EAP-geometry are a\nnonlinear connection assumed given a priori and $2n$ linearly independent\nvector fields (of special form) defined globally on $TM$ defining the\nparallelization. Four different $d$-connections are used to explore the\nproperties of this geometry. Simple and compact formulae for the curvature\ntensors and the W-tensors of the four defined $d$-connections are obtained,\nexpressed in terms of the torsion and the contortion tensors of the EAP-space.\nFurther conditions are imposed on the canonical $d$-connection assuming that it\nis of Cartan type (resp. Berwald type). Important consequences of these\nassumptions are investigated. Finally, a special form of the canonical\n$d$-connection is studied under which the classical AP-geometry is recovered\nnaturally from the EAP-geometry. Physical aspects of some of the geometric\nobjects investigated are pointed out and possible physical implications of the\nEAP-space are discussed, including an outline of a generalized field theory on\nthe tangent bundle $TM$ of $M$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2008 12:13:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 2008 15:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2009 19:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2009 05:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For\nsmall separations gravitational perturbation of the secondary star has a strong\ninfluence on the planet formation process.

Due\nto its small semi-major axis (18.5 AU) and large eccentricity (e=0.35) the\nbinary $\\gamma$ Cephei represents a particularly challenging example. In the\npresent study we model the orbital evolution and growth of embedded\nprotoplanetary cores of about 30 earth masses in the putative protoplanetary\ndisk surrounding the primary star in the $\\gamma$ Cep system. We assume\ncoplanarity of the disk, binary and planet and perform two-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations of embedded cores in a protoplanetary disk. The\npresence of the eccentric secondary star perturbs the disk periodically and\ngenerates strong spiral arms at periapse which propagate toward the disk\ncentre. The disk also becomes slightly eccentric (with e_d = 0.1-0.15), and\ndisplays a slow retrograde precession in the inertial frame. For all initial\nseparations (2.5 to 3.5 AU) we find inward migration of the cores. For initial\nsemi-major axes (a_p \\gsim 2.7), we find a strong increase in the planetary\neccentricity despite the presence of inward migration. Only cores which are\ninitially far from the disk outer edge have a bounded orbital eccentricity\nwhich converges, roughly to the value of the planet observed in the $\\gamma$\nCep system. We have shown that under the condition protoplanetary cores can\nform at around 2.5 AU, it is possible to evolve and grow such a core to form a\nplanet with final outcome similar to that observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2008 14:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We find that the core helium flash\nneither rips the star apart, nor that it significantly alters its structure, as\nconvection plays a crucial role in keeping the star in hydrostatic equilibrium.\nIn addition, our simulations show the presence of overshooting, which implies\nnew predictions concerning mixing of chemical species in red giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2008 14:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nclustering, which develops in time starting from scales around the grid scale,\nis qualitatively very similar to that seen in cosmological simulations, which\nbegin from lattices with applied correlated displacements and incorporate an\nexpanding spatial background.

The quasi-local mass is expected to be a type of flux integral on\nthe boundary two-surface and should be independent of whichever space-like\nregion it bounds. An important idea which is related to the Hamiltonian\nformulation of general relativity is to consider a reference surface in a flat\nambient space with the same first fundamental form and derive the quasi-local\nmass from the difference of the extrinsic geometries. This approach has been\ntaken by Brown-York and Liu-Yau (see also related works) to define such notions\nusing the isometric embedding theorem into the Euclidean three-space. However,\nthere exist surfaces in the Minkowski space whose quasilocal mass is strictly\npositive. It appears that the momentum information needs to be accounted for to\nreconcile the difference. In order to fully capture this information, we use\nisometric embeddings into the Minkowski space as references.

A majority of systems are accelerated\noutwardly, and they all progressively weaken and disappear over timescales of\nweeks. A few of the systems having narrow, deeper absorption reveal a rich\nspectrum of singly ionized Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba lines. Analysis\nof the richest such system, in Nova LMC 2005, shows the excitation temperature\nto be 104 K and elements lighter than Fe to have abundance enhancements over\nsolar values by up to an order of magnitude. The gas causing the absorption\nsystems must be circumbinary and its origin is most likely mass ejection from\nthe secondary star. The absorbing gas pre-exists the outburst and may represent\nepisodic mass transfer events from the secondary star that initiate the nova\noutburst(s). If SNe Ia originate in single degenerate binaries, such absorption\nsystems could be detectable before maximum light\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2008 15:41:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\namplitudes of the applied voltage pulses range from 5 to 96 kV; most pulses\nhave rise times of 30 ns or shorter. Diameters, velocities and energies of the\nstreamers are measured. Two regimes are identified; a low voltage regime where\nonly positive streamers appear and a high voltage regime where both positive\nand negative streamers exist. Below 5 kV, no streamers emerge. In the range\nfrom 5 to 40 kV, positive streamers form, while the negative discharges only\nform a glowing cloud at the electrode tip, but no streamers. For 5 to 20 kV,\ndiameters and velocities of the positive streamers have the minimal values of\nd=0.2 mm and v \\approx 10^5 m/s. For 20 to 40 kV, their diameters increase by a\nfactor 6 while the voltage increases only by a factor 2. Above the transition\nvalue of 40 kV, streamers of both polarities form; they strongly resemble each\nother, though the positive ones propagate further; their diameters continue to\nincrease with applied voltage. For 96 kV, positive streamers attain diameters\nof 3 mm and velocities of 4*10^6 m/s, negative streamers are about 20 % slower\nand thinner. An empirical fit formula for the relation between velocity v and\ndiameter d is v=0.5 d^2/(mm ns) for both polarities. Streamers of both\npolarities dissipate energies of the order of several mJ per streamer while\ncrossing the gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2008 15:55:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 21:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-21"}
