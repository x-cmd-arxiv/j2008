We develop a one-step estimator, and prove an\noracle property which consists of a notion of block sign-consistency and\nasymptotic normality. In particular, provided the initial estimator of the\nCholesky factor is good enough and the true Cholesky has finite number of\nnon-zero off-diagonal bands, oracle property holds for the one-step estimator\neven if $p_n \\gg n$, and can even be as large as $\\log p_n = o(n)$, where the\ndata $\\y$ has mean zero and tail probability $P(|y_j| > x) \\leq K\\exp(-Cx^d)$,\n$d > 0$, and $p_n$ is the number of variables.

We extend previous models by implementing feedback in\ngravitationally bound clouds: momentum is injected at a rate proportional to\nthe star formation rate. This mechanical energy disperses cloud gas back into\nthe surrounding ISM, truncating star formation in a given cloud, and raising\nthe overall level of ambient turbulence. Propagating star formation can however\noccur as expanding shells collide, enhancing the density and triggering new\ncloud and star formation. By controlling the momentum injection per massive\nstar and the specific star formation rate in dense gas, we find that the\nnegative effects of high turbulence outweigh the positive ones, and in net\nfeedback reduces the fraction of dense gas and thus the overall star formation\nrate. The properties of the large clouds that form are not, however, very\nsensitive to feedback, with cutoff masses of a few million solar masses,\nsimilar to observations. We find a relationship between the star formation rate\nsurface density and the gas surface density with a power law index ~2 for our\nmodels with the largest dynamic range, consistent with theoretical expectations\nfor our model of disk flaring. We point out that the value of the\n\"Kennicutt-Schmidt\" index depends on the thickness of the disk. With our simple\nfeedback prescription (a single combined star formation event per cloud), we\nfind that global spiral patterns are not sustained; less correlated feedback\nand smaller scale turbulence appear to be necessary for spiral patterns to\npersist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2008 17:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

An open problem in numerical analysis is to explain the apparent\nreliability of molecular dynamics simulations. The difficulty is that\nindividual trajectories computed in molecular dynamics are accurate for only\nshort time intervals, whereas apparently reliable information can be extracted\nfrom very long-time simulations. It has been conjectured that long molecular\ndynamics trajectories have low-dimensional statistical features that accurately\napproximate those of the original system. Another conjecture is that numerical\ntrajectories satisfy the shadowing property: that they are close over long time\nintervals to exact trajectories but with different initial conditions. We prove\nthat these two views are actually equivalent to each other, after we suitably\nmodify the concept of shadowing. A key ingredient of our result is a general\ntheorem that allows us to take random elements of a metric space that are close\nin distribution and embed them in the same probability space so that they are\nclose in a strong sense. This result is similar to the Strassen-Dudley Theorem\nexcept that a mapping is provided between the two random elements. Our results\non shadowing are motivated by molecular dynamics but apply to the approximation\nof any dynamical system when initial conditions are selected according to a\nprobability measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2008 18:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 18:53:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2009 20:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

DM particles of the parent halo are accreted in the\nproto-stellar interior by adiabatic contraction and scattering/capture\nprocesses, reaching central densities of order 1e12 GeV/cm3 at radii of the\norder of 10 AU. Energy release from annihilation reactions can effectively\ncounteract the gravitational collapse, in agreement with results from other\ngroups.

Recent advances and requirements in communication technologies have\nattracted great interest in PMC's and Casimir experiments involving structures\nthat approximate PMC's may be carried out in the not too distant future. In\nthis paper, we make a study of the zero-temperature PMC Casimir piston in $d+1$\ndimensions. The PMC Casimir energy is explicitly evaluated by summing over\n$p+1$-dimensional Dirichlet energies where p ranges from 2 to $d$ inclusively.\nWe derive two exact $d$-dimensional expressions for the Casimir force on the\npiston and find that the force is negative (attractive) in all dimensions. Both\nexpressions are applied to the case of 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. A spin-off from\nour work is a contribution to the PEC literature: we obtain a useful\nalternative expression for the PEC Casimir piston in 3+1 dimensions and also\nevaluate the Casimir force per unit area on an infinite strip, a geometry of\nexperimental interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2008 02:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The difficult problem of the solution bifurcations of the governing\nnonlinear partial differential equations (PDE's) is solved through a novel\napproach. By using a methodology involving coupled series-asymptotic\nexpansions, we derive the normal form equation of the original complicated\nsystem of nonlinear PDE's.

The engineering stress-strain\ncurve plotted from the asymptotic solutions can capture the key features of the\ncurve measured in a few experiments (e.g., the stress drop, the stress plateau,\nand the small stress valley). It appears that the asymptotic solutions obtained\nshed certain light on the instability phenomena associated with phase\ntransitions in a cylinder, in particular the role played by the radius-length\nratio.

In the first\nstep, a classical analysis allows one to distinguish between four distinct\nregions in the parameter space according to the nature of the singularities\narising in the classical energy surface; these correspond to spectral critical\npoints. The eigenfunctions are then analyzed more precisely in terms of the\nassociated roots of the Majorana polynomial, leading to exact expressions for\nthe density of states in the thermodynamic limit. Finite-size effects are also\nanalyzed, leading in particular to logarithmic corrections near the\nsingularities occuring in the spectrum. Finally, we also compute expectation\nvalues of the spin operators in a semi-classical analysis in order to\nillustrate some subtle effects occuring in one region of the parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2008 09:51:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 07:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-01"}

A quasi-coherent sheaf on X gives rise, by taking sections over the\ncovering sets, to a diagram of modules over the various coordinate rings. The\nresulting \"twisted\" diagram of modules satisfies a certain gluing condition,\nstating that the data is compatible with restriction to smaller open sets.\n  In case X is a regular toric scheme over an arbitrary commutative ring, we\nprove that the unbounded derived category D(X) of quasi-coherent sheaves on X\ncan be obtained from a category of twisted diagrams which do not necessarily\nsatisfy any gluing condition by inverting maps which induce homology\nisomorphisms on hyper-derived inverse limits.

We present a peculiar Cepheid-like star, in the direction of\nthe Small Magellanic Cloud, which demonstrates unusual photometric behaviour\nover a short time interval. We report on data of the photometry acquired by the\nMARLY telescope and spectroscopy from the EFOSC instrument for this star,\ncalled EROS2 J005135-714459(sm0060n13842), which resembles the unusual Cepheid\nHR 7308. The light curve of our target is analysed using the Analysis of\nVariance method to determine a pulsational period of 5.5675 days. A fit of\ntime-dependent Fourier coefficients is performed and a search for proper motion\nis conducted. The light curve exhibits a previously unobserved and spectacular\nchange in both mean magnitude and amplitude, which has no clear theoretical\nexplanation. Our analysis of the spectrum implies a radial velocity of 104 km\ns$^{-1}$ and a metallicity of -0.4$\\pm$0.2 dex. In the direction of right\nascension, we measure a proper motion of 17.4$\\pm$6.0 mas yr$^{-1}$ using EROS\nastrometry, which is compatible with data from the NOMAD catalogue. The nature\nof EROS2 J005135-714459(sm0060n13842) remains unclear. For this star, we may\nhave detected a non-zero proper motion for this star, which would imply that it\nis a foreground object. Its radial velocity, pulsational characteristics, and\nphotometric data, however, suggest that it is instead a Cepheid-like object\nlocated in the SMC. In such a case, it would present a challenge to\nconventional Cepheid models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2008 14:17:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 May 2008 08:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Also, the modeling of\nthe radiation from some of the detected sources points to them as either\nextremely efficient accelerators, and/or having the TeV emitter at a distance\nfrom the compact object of about 10e12 cm.

Evolving the\nfunctionality presented by previous solutions, we provide a friendly graphical\nuser interface through which the high-level theoretic researcher/designer of a\nP2P system can easily construct an overlay with the desirable number of nodes\nand evaluate its operations using a number of key distributions. Furthermore,\nthe simulator has built-in ability to produce statistics about the distributed\nstructure. Emphasis was given to the parametrical configuration of the\nsimulator. As a result the developed tool can be utilized in the simulation and\nevaluation procedures of a variety of different protocols, with only few\nchanges in the Java code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2008 14:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Stringent limits can be set on beta, thus, on models\nof quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2008 15:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We show how the\ninhomogeneities in the Higgs field, resulting from tachyonic preheating after\ninflation, seed the magnetic fields in a way analogous to that predicted by\nVachaspati and Cornwall in the context of the EW symmetry breaking. At this\nstage, the helical nature of the generated magnetic fields is linked to the\nnon-trivial winding of the Higgs-field. We analyze non-perturbatively the\nevolution of these helical seeds through the highly non-linear stages of\nsymmetry breaking (SB) and beyond. Electroweak SB occurs via the nucleation and\ngrowth of Higgs bubbles which squeeze the magnetic fields into string-like\nstructures. The W-boson charge density clusters in lumps around the magnetic\nstrings. After symmetry breaking, a detailed analysis of the magnetic field\nFourier spectrum shows two well differentiated components: a UV radiation tail\nat a temperature T ~ 0.23 m_higgs slowly growing with time, and an IR peak\nassociated to the helical magnetic fields, which seems to follow inverse\ncascade. The system enters a regime in which we observe that both the amplitude\n(\\rho_B/\\rho_{EW} ~ 0.01) and the correlation length of the magnetic field grow\nlinearly with time. During this stage of evolution we also observe a power-law\ngrowth in the helical susceptibility. These properties support the possibility\nthat our scenario could provide the seeds eventually evolving into the\nmicrogauss fields observed today in galaxies and clusters of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2008 09:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
