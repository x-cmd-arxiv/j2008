We focus on the instability of a stationary cellular\npattern of wave number $k_s$ which undergoes a globally subcritical transition\nto traveling waves by parity-breaking symmetry. The experimental results show\nhow the emerging traveling mode ($2/3k_{s}$) switches on a resonant triad\n($k_s$, $k_s/2$, $2k_{s}/3$) within the cellular pattern yielding a ``mixed''\npattern. The nature of this transition is described quantitatively in terms of\nthe evolution of the fundamental modes by complex demodulation techniques. The\nB\\' enard-Marangoni convection accounts for the different dynamics depending on\nthe depth of the fluid layer and on the vertical temperature difference. The\nexistence of a hysteresis cycle has been evaluated quantitatively. When the\nbifurcation to traveling waves is measured in the vicinity of the codimension-2\nbifurcation point, we measure a decrease of the subcritical interval in which\nthe traveling mode becomes unstable. From the traveling wave state the system\nunder goes a {\\it new} global secondary bifurcation to an alternating pattern\nwhich doubles the wavelength ($k_{s}/2$) of the primary cellular pattern, this\nresult compares well with theoretical predictions [P.

By calculating the rate of stellar collisions\nusing an N-body model for the cluster, we find remarkable agreement between the\naverage time between collisions and the inferred dust lifetime in this cluster,\nsuggesting a possible close relation between the two phenomena. Furthermore, we\nalso obtain the birthrate of blue stragglers formed through collisions in M15.\nBy comparing with the observed number of blue stragglers, we derive an upper\nlimit for their average lifetime which turns out to be consistent with recent\nmodel calculations, thereby lending further support to our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 17:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A vast array of\nscience will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will\nhave unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is\ndriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking\nan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and\nmapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at\nCerro Pach\\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m\neffective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel\ncamera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second\nexposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given\nnight. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000\nsquare degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\\sigma$\npoint-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\\sim 24.5$ (AB). The\nproject is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations\nby 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with\n$\\delta<+34.5^\\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$,\ncovering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90\\% of the observing time\nwill be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a\n18,000 deg$^2$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the\nanticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to $r\\sim27.5$.

We find that the weight\nfactors fluctuate only moderately on nHYP smeared dynamical Wilson-clover\nensembles, and we could successfully reweight 16^4, (1.85fm)^4 volume\nconfigurations from m_q = 20MeV to m_q = 5MeV quark masses, reaching the\nepsilon-regime. We illustrate the strength of the method by calculating the low\nenergy constant F from the epsilon-regime pseudo-scalar correlator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 17:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The lens\nis a massive galaxy member of the cluster Cl J0152.7-1357 at z ~ 0.84. Taking\nadvantage of this exceptional configuration and of the excellent angular\nresolution of the HST/ACS, we measure the properties of the lens. Several\nparametric macroscopic models were developed for the lens galaxy, starting from\npointlike to extended image models. For a lens model in terms of a singular\nisothermal sphere with external shear, the Einstein radius is found to be R_{E}\n= (9.54 +/- 0.15) kpc. The external shear points to the cluster's northern mass\npeak. The unknown redshift of the source is determined to be higher than 1.9\nand lower than 2.9. Our estimate of the lensing projected total mass inside the\nEinstein radius, M_{len}(R < 9.54 kpc), depends on the source distance and lies\nbetween 4.6 and 6.2 x 10^{11} M_{Sun}. This result turns out to be compatible\nwith the dynamical estimate based on an isothermal model. By considering the\nconstraint on the stellar mass-to-light ratio that comes from the evolution of\nthe Fundamental Plane, we can exclude the possibility that at more than 4 sigma\nlevel the total mass enclosed inside the Einstein ring is only luminous matter.\nMoreover, the photometric-stellar mass measurement within the Einstein radius\ngives a minimum value of 50% (1 sigma) for the dark-to-total matter fraction.\nThe lensing analysis has allowed us to investigate the distribution of mass of\nthe deflector, also providing some interesting indications on scales that are\nlarger and smaller than the Einstein radius of the lens galaxy. The combination\nof different diagnostics has proved to be essential in determining quantities\nthat otherwise would have not been directly measurable with the current data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 19:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It consists in the presence of a minimum in the\nmean time spent by a Brownian particle to exit from a potential well in the\npresence of a fluctuating external force, as a function of the mean frequency\n(or the correlation time) of the latter. This work studies the role played by\nthe asymmetry of a piecewise linear potential in the RA effect, and, in\ngeneral, the behavior of the mean first passage time and the mean velocity of\nthe particle crossing through the potential barrier. A strong dependence on the\nasymmetry of the potential has been found which can be put in relationship with\nthe current in the ratchet whose the potential here used is an elementary\nmodule. In this case a current reversal as a function of the frequency of the\nswitching potential occurs. Comparison of the calculations with the\nDoering-Gadua model have been performed, as well as comparison with smooth\nsymmetrical potentials, by checking for the robustness of the resonant\ncorrelation time. The calculations have been done by solving numerically the\nLangevin equation in the presence of an uncorrelated Gaussian noise. The\nresonant mean first passage times show an unexpected behavior as a function of\nthe thermal noise intensity.

Using two global indicators we quantify the\nsynchronizability on the two regimes, focusing on the roles of the network\nconnectivity and the topology. The connectivity is measured in terms of the\naverage number of links per node, and we consider various topologies\n(scale-free, small-world, star, and nearest-neighbor with and without a central\nhub). With weak connectivity and weak coupling strength, the network displays\nan irregular oscillatory dynamics that is largely independent of the topology\nand of the delay distribution. With heterogeneous delays, we find a threshold\nconnectivity level below which the network does not synchronize, regardless of\nthe network size.

In previous\nnumerical simulations cavities are formed by injecting ultra-hot but\nnon-relativistic gas which increases the global thermal energy, offsetting\nradiative losses in the gas and helping to solve the cooling flow problem.\nContrary to these results, we find that X-ray cavities formed solely by cosmic\nrays have a global cooling effect.

Most cosmic rays in our\ncavity evolutions do not move beyond the cooling radius even after 1 Gyr. The\ngas density is depressed by cosmic rays, becomes buoyant, and undergoes a\nsignificant outward mass transfer within the cooling radius, carrying cosmic\nrays and relatively low entropy gas to distant regions in the cluster where it\nremains for times exceeding the local cooling time in the hot gas.

We solve the continuity\nequation for SMBH mass function using the locally determined one as a boundary\ncondition, and the hard X-ray luminosity function as tracer of the AGN growth\nrate distribution, supplemented with a luminosity-dependent bolometric\ncorrection and an absorbing column distribution. Differently from most previous\nsemi-analytic and numerical models, we do not assume any specific distribution\nof Eddington ratios, rather we determine it empirically by coupling the mass\nand luminosity functions. SMBH show a very broad accretion rate distribution,\nand we discuss the consequences of this fact for our understanding of observed\nAGN fractions in galaxies. We confirm previous results and demonstrate that, at\nleast for z<1.5, SMBH mass function evolves anti-hierarchically, i.e. the most\nmassive holes grew earlier and faster than less massive ones. For the first\ntime, we find hints of a reversal of such a downsizing behaviour at redshifts\nabove the peak of the black hole accretion rate density (z~2). We also derive\ntight constraints on the (mass weighted) average radiative efficiency of AGN:\nwe find that 0.065<\\xi_0 \\epsilon_{rad}< 0.07$, where \\xi_0 is the local SMBH\nmass density in units of 4.3x10^5 M_sun Mpc^{-3}. We trace the cosmological\nevolution of the kinetic luminosity function of AGN, and find that the overall\nefficiency of SMBH in converting accreted rest mass energy into kinetic power,\nranges between 3 and 5 \\times 10^{-3}.

Here we investigate the adiabatic transport of such\nmany-particle trial wavefunctions using methods from two-dimensional field\ntheory. One context for this is to calculate the statistics of widely-separated\nquasiholes, which has been predicted to be non-Abelian in a variety of cases.\nThe Berry phase or matrix (holonomy) resulting from adiabatic transport around\na closed loop in parameter space is the same as the effect of analytic\ncontinuation around the same loop with the particle coordinates held fixed\n(monodromy), provided the trial functions are orthonormal and holomorphic in\nthe parameters so that the Berry vector potential (or connection) vanishes.

The resulting lensing signal is consistent\nwith an NFW or Einasto profile on scales outside the central region.

The exotic regions of the chart of nuclides\nhave been explored during the three last decades. Then the postulate of\npermanent magic numbers was de nitely abandoned and the reason for these\nstructural mutations has been in turn searched for. General trends in the\nevolution of shell closures are discussed using complementary experimental\ninformation, such as the binding energies of the orbits bounding the shell\ngaps, the trends of the rst collective states of the even-even semi-magic\nnuclei, and the behavior of certain single-nucleon states. Each section is\ndevoted to a particular magic number. It describes the underlying physics of\nthe shell evolution which is not yet fully understood and indicates future\nexperimental and theoretical challenges. The nuclear mean eld embodies various\nfacets of the Nucleon- Nucleon interaction, among which the spin-orbit and\ntensor terms play decisive roles in the shell evolutions. The present review\nintends to provide experimental constraints to be used for the re nement of\ntheoretical models aiming at a good description of the existing atomic nuclei\nand at more accurate predictions of hitherto unreachable systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2008 15:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

The effects of the density gradient in the\ndirection perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field vector, observed in the\nexperiment, are discussed. In addition, the possible presence of electrons is\ndiscussed in the context of plasma modes propagating at an angle with respect\nto the magnetic field vector. The electrons may either be added to the plasma\nor enter the plasma attached to negative ions and then become released from the\nions as a result of collisions. It is shown that the electron plasma mode in a\ncold plasma may become a backward mode in the presence of a density gradient,\nand this behavior may be controlled either by the electron number density or\nthe mode number in the perpendicular direction. In plasmas with hot electrons\nan instability may develop, driven by the combination of electron collisions\nand the density gradient, and in the regime when the ions' response is similar\nto a sound mode, i.e., for un-magnetized ions, implying mode frequencies much\nabove the ion gyro-frequency or mode wave-lengths shorter than the ion\ngyro-radius. In the case of a pure pair-ion plasma, for lower frequencies and\nfor parameters close to those used in the recent experiments, the perturbed\nions may feel the effects of the magnetic field. In this case the plasma mode\nalso becomes backward, resembling features of an experimentally observed but\nyet unexplained backward mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2008 15:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The comparison of the phase diagrams\nshows that thermodynamic properties of the solution are not merely shifted with\nrespect to the bulk. Moreover, from the analysis of the thermodynamic curves,\nboth the spinodal line and the temperatures of maximum density curve can be\ncalculated. The spinodal line appears not to be influenced by the presence of\nions at the chosen concentration, while the temperatures of maximum density\ncurve displays both a mild shift in temperature and a shape modification with\nrespect to bulk. Signatures of the presence of a liquid-liquid critical point\nare found in the aqueous solution. By analysing the water-ion radial\ndistribution functions of the aqueous solution we observe that upon changing\ndensity, structural modifications appear close to the spinodal.

The types are assigned based\non the overall morphology of spectra covering 6000\\AA to 9000\\AA. The types and\nsequence presented link the spectral types of cool subdwarfs to their main\nsequence counterparts, with emphasis on the relatively opacity-free region from\n8200--9000\\AA. When available, supporting abundance, kinematic, and\ntrigonometric parallax information is used to provide more complete portraits\nof the observed subdwarfs. We find that the CaHn (n $=$ 1--3) and TiO5 indices\noften used for subdwarf spectral typing are affected in complicated ways by\ncombinations of subdwarfs' temperatures, metallicities, and gravities, and we\nuse model grids to evaluate the trends in all three parameters. Because of the\ncomplex interplay of these three characteristics, it is not possible to\nidentify a star as an ``extreme'' subdwarf simply based on very low\nmetallicity, and we suggest that the modifiers ``extreme'' or ``ultra'' only\noutline locations on spectroscopic indices plots, and should not be used to\nimply low or very low metallicity stars. In addition, we propose that ``VI'' be\nused to identify a star as a subdwarf, rather than the confusing ``sd'' prefix,\nwhich is also used for hot O and B subdwarfs that are unrelated to the cool\nsubdwarfs discussed in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2008 15:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
