We work in the general setting of\nderived algebraic geometry: our basic objects are derived stacks X and their\noo-categories QC(X) of quasicoherent sheaves. We show that for a broad class of\nderived stacks, called perfect stacks, algebraic and geometric operations on\ntheir categories of sheaves are compatible. We identify the category of sheaves\non a fiber product with the tensor product of the categories of sheaves on the\nfactors. We also identify the category of sheaves on a fiber product with\nfunctors between the categories of sheaves on the factors (thus realizing\nfunctors as integral transforms, generalizing a theorem of Toen for ordinary\nschemes). As a first application, for a perfect stack X, consider QC(X) with\nits usual monoidal tensor product. Then our main results imply the equivalence\nof the Drinfeld center (or Hochschild cohomology category) of QC(X), the trace\n(or Hochschild homology category) of QC(X) and the category of sheaves on the\nloop space of X. More generally, we show that the E_n-center and the E_n-trace\n(or E_n-Hochschild cohomology and homology categories respectively) of QC(X)\nare equivalent to the category of sheaves on the space of maps from the\nn-sphere into X. This directly verifies geometric instances of the categorified\nDeligne and Kontsevich conjectures on the structure of Hochschild cohomology.\nAs a second application, we use our main results to calculate the Drinfeld\ncenter of categories of linear endofunctors of categories of sheaves. This\nprovides concrete applications to the structure of Hecke algebras in geometric\nrepresentation theory. Finally, we explain how all of the above results can be\ninterpreted in the context of topological field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2008 17:47:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 May 2008 15:20:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 24 May 2008 23:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 02:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 01:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-31"}

A\ncombination of exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group,\nvariational Monte Carlo, and bosonization analysis of a quasi-1D gauge theory,\nall provide compelling evidence for the existence of a new strong-coupling\nphase of bosons on the 2-leg ladder which can be understood as a descendant of\nthe two-dimensional DBL.

The optical line diagnostics\nsupport the presence of AGN in the bulk of the weak-PAH sources.

The power\nspectrum of the residuals is, on the largest scales, four orders of magnitude\nlower than that of the input Galaxy power spectrum at the foreground minimum.\nThe CMB power spectrum was accurately recovered up to the sixth acoustic peak.\nThe point source detection limit reaches 100 mJy, and about 2300 clusters are\ndetected via the thermal SZ effect on two thirds of the sky.

We focus on the short-time dynamics of\ncar-following models which describe continuous feedback control tasks\n(acceleration and braking) and models for discrete-choice tasks as a response\nto the surrounding traffic. The driving style of an agent is characterized by\nmodel parameters such as reaction time, desired speed, desired time gap,\nanticipation etc. In addition, internal state variables corresponding to the\nagent's \"mind\" are used to incorporate the driving experiences. We introduce a\ntime-dependency of some parameters to describe the frustration of drivers being\nin a traffic jam for a while. Furthermore, the driver's behavior is externally\ninfluenced by the neighboring vehicles and also by environmental input such as\nlimited motorization and braking power, visibility conditions and road traffic\nregulations. A general approach for dealing with discrete decision problems in\nthe context of vehicular traffic is introduced and applied to mandatory and\ndiscretionary lane changes. Furthermore, we consider the decision process\nwhether to brake or not when approaching a traffic light turning from green to\namber.

From the cross-correlation function, we are able to measure\nrelative flux levels, estimate the spectral types of the components, and set\nupper limits on the orbital periods and separations. The resulting system is\nhierarchical composed of K7 + K7 binary and a M1 + M2 binary with semi-major\naxes of asini_{A}<=0.06 AU and asini_{B}<=0.30 AU. A subsequent search of the\nSuperWASP photometric database revealed that the K7 + K7 binary is eclipsing\nwith a period of 2.21 days and at an inclination angle of 85 degrees. Within\nuncertainties of 5%, the masses and radii of both components appear to be equal\n(0.59 Msun, 0.61 Rsun). These two tightly orbiting stars (a = 0.035 AU) are in\nsynchronous rotation causing the observed excess Ca II, Halpha, X-ray and UV\nemission. The fact that the system was unresolved with published adaptive\noptics imaging, limits the projected physical separation of the two binaries at\nthe time of the observation to d_{AB} < 4.1 AU at the photometric distance of\n51 pc. The maximum observed radial velocity difference between the A and B\nbinaries limits the orbit to asini_{AB}<=6.1 AU. As this tight configuration is\ndifficult to reproduce with current formation models of multiple systems, we\nspeculate that an early dynamical process reduced the size of the system such\nas the interaction of the two binaries with a circumquadruple disk. Intensive\nphotometric, spectroscopic and interferometric monitoring as well as a parallax\nmeasurement of this rare quadruple system is certainly warranted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2008 20:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We\nstart by measuring the distributions of avalanche and transient times in Random\nBoolean Networks (RBNs) and in the \\emph{Drosophila} polarity network by exact\nenumeration. A transient time is the duration of the transient from a starting\nstate to an attractor. An avalanche is a special transient which starts as\nsingle Boolean element perturbation of an attractor state. Significant\ndifferences at short times between the avalanche and the transient times for\nRBNs with small connectivity $K$ -- compared to the number of elements $N$ --\nindicate that attractors tend to cluster in configuration space. In addition,\none bit flip has a non-negligible chance to put an attractor state directly\nonto another attractor. This clustering is also present in the segment polarity\ngene network of \\emph{Drosophila melanogaster}, suggesting that this may be a\nrobust feature of biological regulatory networks. We also define and measure a\nbranching ratio for the state space networks and find evidence for a new time\nscale that diverges roughly linearly with $N$ for $2\\leq K \\ll N$. Analytic\narguments show that this time scale does not appear in the random map nor can\nthe random map exhibit clustering of attractors.

Three proposed models\nremain viable at this time, but none of the three is significantly more\ncompelling than the remaining two, and all three can satisfy the observational\nconstraints if parameters in the models are tuned. One of the three proposed\nmodels is the direct impact model of Marsh & Steeghs (2002), in which the\naccretion stream impacts the surface of a rapidly-rotating primary white dwarf\ndirectly but at a near-glancing angle. One requirement of this model is that\nthe accretion stream have a high enough density to advect its specific kinetic\nenergy below the photosphere for progressively more-thermalized emission\ndownstream, a constraint that requires an accretion spot size of roughly\n1.2x10^5 km^2 or smaller. Having at hand a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code\noptimized for cataclysmic variable accretion disk simulations, it was\nrelatively straightforward for us to adapt it to calculate the footprint of the\naccretion stream at the nominal radius of the primary white dwarf, and thus to\ntest this constraint of the direct impact model.

We compute the effect induced by unparticle operators\nof scalar and vector nature coupled to fermions on the CMDM. We find that this\ndipole moment is sensitive to the scale dimensions $d_u$ of the unparticle and\nthe new couplings of the respective effective operators. Using the bounds\nimposed on the CMDM by low-energy precision and Tevatron measurements we derive\nindirect limits on the unparticle parameter space. In particular, we find that\nthe scalar-unparticle operator contribution fulfills both constraints for most\nof the unparticle parameter space, while the low-energy precision bound on the\nCMDM excludes a vector-unparticle contribution for low values of respective\nscale dimension $d_u$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 May 2008 15:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-17"}
