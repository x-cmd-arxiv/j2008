In particular, we\nconsider a pair of single pass amplifiers based on potassium dideuterium\nphosphate (DKDP), pumped by the second harmonic of Nd:glass and tuned to\namplify adjacent regions of the signal spectrum. We demonstrate that a\nbandwidth enhancement up to 50% is possible in two configurations; in the first\ncase, one of the two amplifiers is operated near its non-collinear broadband\nlimit; to allow for effective recombination and recompression of the outgoing\nsignals this configuration requires filtering and phase manipulation of the\nspectral tail of the amplified pulses. In the second case, effective\nrecombination can be achieved simply by spectral filtering: in this\nconfiguration, the optimization of the parameters of the amplifiers (pulse,\ncrystal orientation and crystal length) does not follow the recipes of\nnon-collinear OPCPA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2008 17:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2008 14:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We show that, aside from finite-size effects, its dynamics is governed\nby the dimensionless sperm number, the magnitude of the magnetic field, and the\nangular amplitude of the field's oscillating direction. Then we study the mean\nvelocity and the efficiency of the swimmer as a function of these parameters\nand the size of the load particle. In particular, we clarify that the real\nvelocity of the swimmer is influenced by two main factors, namely the shape of\nthe beating filament (determined by the sperm number and the magnetic-field\nstrength) and the oscillation frequency. Furthermore, the load size influences\nthe performance of the swimmer and has to be chosen as a compromise between the\nlargest swimming velocity and the best efficiency.

For M3 (NGC 5272), different\nshapes for the HB mass distribution have been suggested, including Gaussian and\nsharply bimodal alternatives. Here we study the mass distribution of HB stars\nin M3 by comparing evolutionary tracks and photometric observations. Our\napproach is thus of a semi-empirical nature, describing as it does the mass\ndistribution that is favored from the standpoint of canonical stellar\nevolutionary predictions for the distribution of stars across the CMD. We\nlocate, for each individual HB star, the evolutionary track whose distance from\nthe star's observed color and magnitude is a minimum. Artificial tests reveal\nthat our method would be able to detect a bimodal mass distribution, if\npresent. We study the impact of different procedures for taking into account\nthe evolutionary speed, and conclude that they have but a small effect upon the\ninferred mass distribution. We find that a Gaussian shape, though providing a\nreasonable first approximation, fails to account for the detailed shape of M3's\nHB mass distribution: the latter may have skewness and kurtosis that deviate\nslightly from a perfectly Gaussian solution. Alternatively, the excess of stars\ntowards the wings of the distribution may also be accounted for in terms of a\nbimodal distribution in which both the low- and the high-mass modes are normal,\nthe former being significantly wider than the latter. However, we also show\nthat the inferred distribution of evolutionary times is inconsistent with\ntheoretical expectations.

One-way (where only the source\nhas data for destination) and two-way (where the destination also has data for\nthe source) multi-hop relay channels are considered with both the full-duplex\nand half duplex relay nodes.

The modelling shows that the circumstellar lines of Na I doublet will\nnot be seen in type IIP supernovae for moderate wind density, e.g.,\ncharacteristic of SN 1999em, whereas rather pronounced Ca II lines with P Cygni\nprofile should be detectable. A similar model is used to describe Na I and Ca\nII circumstellar lines seen in SN 1998S, type IIL with a dense wind. We show\nthat line intensities in this supernova are reproduced, if one assumes an\nultraviolet excess, which is caused primarily by the comptonization of\nsupernova radiation in the shock wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2008 08:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The mass of the chiral partner of the\nnucleon is assumed to be 1200 MeV. The transition to the chiral restored phase\nturns out to be a smooth crossover in all the cases considered, taking place at\na baryon density of just $2\\rho_0$. The mass-radius relations of compact stars\nare calculated to constrain the model parameters from the maximum mass limit of\nneutron stars. It is demonstrated that chiral symmetry starts to be restored,\nwhich in this model implies the appearance of the chiral partners of the\nnucleons, in the center of neutron stars. However, the analysis of the decay\nwidth of the assumed chiral partner of the nucleon poses limits on the validity\nof the present version of the model to describe vacuum properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2008 15:27:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 13:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Improved CIE calculations based on these\nrecombination and ionization data are presented here. We have also developed a\nnew systematic method for determining the average emission measure ($EM$) and\nelectron temperature ($T_e$) of an isothermal plasma. With our new CIE data and\nour new approach for determining average $EM$ and $T_e$, we have reanalyzed\nSUMER observations of the solar corona. We have compared our results with those\nof previous studies and found some significant differences for the derived $EM$\nand $T_e$. We have also calculated the enhancement of coronal elemental\nabundances compared to their photospheric abundances, using the SUMER\nobservations themselves to determine the abundance enhancement factor for each\nof the emitting elements. Our observationally derived first ionization\npotential (FIP) factors are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical model\nof Laming (2008).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2008 15:28:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 16:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
