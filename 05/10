The embedded contact homology (ECH) index associates\nan integer to each relative 2-dimensional homology class of surfaces whose\nboundary is the difference between two unions of Reeb orbits. This integer\ndetermines the relative grading on ECH; the ECH differential counts holomorphic\ncurves in the symplectization of Y whose relative homology classes have ECH\nindex 1. A known index inequality implies that such curves are (mostly)\nembedded and satisfy some additional constraints. In this paper we prove four\nnew results about the ECH index. First, we refine the relative grading on ECH\nto an absolute grading, which associates to each union of Reeb orbits a\nhomotopy class of oriented 2-plane fields on Y. Second, we extend the ECH index\ninequality to symplectic cobordisms between three-manifolds with Hamiltonian\nstructures, and simplify the proof. Third, we establish general inequalities on\nthe ECH index of unions and multiple covers of holomorphic curves in\ncobordisms. Finally, we define a new relative filtration on ECH, or any other\nkind of contact homology of a contact 3-manifold, which is similar to the ECH\nindex and related to the Euler characteristic of holomorphic curves.

In discussing the present status and prospects\nfor improving the performance of powder-based wire we focus attention on (1)\nthe intrinsic (intragrain) superconducting properties of magnesium diboride,\nHc2 and flux pinning, (2) factors that control the efficiency with which\ncurrent is transported from grain-to-grain in the conductor, an extrinsic\n(intergrain) property. With regard to Item-(1), the role of dopants in Hc2\nenhancement is discussed and examples presented. On the other hand their roles\nin increasing Jc, both via Hc2 enhancement as well as direct\nfluxoid/pining-center interaction, are discussed and a comprehensive survey of\nHc2 dopants and flux-pinning additives is presented. Current transport through\nthe powder-processed wire (an extrinsic property) is partially blocked by the\ninherent granularity of the material itself and the chemical or other\nproperties of the intergrain surfaces. These and other such results indicate\nthat in many cases less than 15% of the conductor's cross sectional area is\nable to carry transport current. It is pointed out that densification in\nassociation with the elimination of grain-boundary blocking phases would yield\nfive-to ten-fold increases in Jc in relevant regimes, enabling the performance\nof magnesium diboride in selected applications to compete with that of Nb-Sn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2008 17:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These GW recoil events can dramatically affect the\ncoevolution of recoiling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host\ngalaxies. However, theoretical studies of SMBH-galaxy evolution almost always\nassume a stationary central black hole. In light of the numerical results on GW\nrecoil velocities, we relax that assumption here and consider the consequences\nof recoil for SMBH evolution. We follow the trajectories of SMBHs ejected in a\nsmooth background potential that includes both a stellar bulge and a\nmulti-component gaseous disk. In addition, we calculate the accretion rate onto\nthe SMBH as a function of time using a hybrid prescription of viscous\n(alpha-disk) and Bondi accretion. We find that recoil kicks between 100 km/s\nand the escape speed cause SMBHs to wander through the galaxy and halo for\nabout 1 Myr - 1 Gyr before settling back to the galactic center. However, the\nmass accreted during this time is roughly constant at about 10% of the initial\nmass, independent of the recoil velocity. This indicates that while large\nrecoils may disrupt active galactic nuclei feedback processes, recoil itself is\nan effective means of regulating SMBH growth.

More formally, we show that the continuous d-dimensional\nMenger-type curvature is comparable to the ``Jones-type flatness''. The latter\nquantity adds up scaled errors of approximations of a measure by d-planes at\ndifferent scales and locations, and is commonly used to characterize uniform\nrectifiability. We thus obtain a characterization of uniform rectifiability by\nusing the Menger-type curvature. In the current paper (part I) we control the\ncontinuous Menger-type curvature of an Ahlfors d-regular measure by its\nJones-type flatness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2008 21:30:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 17:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-08"}

VAULT-2\ndata of network boundaries have an asymmetry on scales larger than\nsupergranules, also indicating an association with long loops. We complement\nthe Kitt Peak data with very sensitive vector polarimetric data from the\nSpectro-Polarimeter on board Hinode, to determine the influence of very small\nmagnetic concentrations on our analysis. From these data two classes of\nbehavior are found: within the cores of strong magnetic flux concentrations ($>\n5\\times10^{18}$ Mx) associated with active network and plage, small-scale mixed\nfields are absent and any short loops can connect just the peripheries of the\nflux to cell interiors. Core fields return to the surface via longer, most\nlikely coronal, loops. In weaker concentrations, short loops can connect\nbetween concentrations and produce mixed fields within network boundaries as\nsuggested by Dowdy and colleagues. The VAULT-2 data which we examined are\nassociated with strong concentrations. We conclude that the cool loop model\napplies only to a small fraction of the VAULT-2 emission, but we cannot\ndiscount a significant role for cool loops in quieter regions.

A second period\nwas present in the light curve of the object for six years. Shortly after the\nnova eruption it was measured as P2=185.6 min. It has decreased monotonically\nin the following few years reaching the value P2=183.9 min in 2003. In 2004 it\nwas no longer detectable.

The asynchronism is probably the result of the nova outburst that lead\nto a considerable expansion of the white dwarf's photosphere.

Our data suggests that the complex, which we refer\nto as the ``molecular ridge,'' is not a coherent feature but consists of many\nsmaller clumps that share the same formation history. Likely molecular cloud\nformation triggers are shocks and shearing forces that are present in the\nsurrounding south-eastern HI overdensity region, a region influenced by strong\nram pressure and tidal forces. The molecular ridge is at the western edge of\nthe the overdensity region where a bifurcated velocity structure transitions\ninto a single disk velocity component. We find that the 12CO(1-0) and HI\nemission peaks in the molecular ridge are typically near each other but never\ncoincide. A likely explanation is the conversion of warmer, low-opacity HI to\ncolder, high-opacity HI from which H2 subsequently forms.

We consider a pair of linear transformations $A:V \\to V$\nand $A^*:V \\to V$ that satisfy the following conditions: (i) each of $A,A^*$ is\ndiagonalizable; (ii) there exists an ordering $\\{V_i\\}{i=0}^d$ of the\neigenspaces of $A$ such that $A^* V_i \\subseteq V_{i-1} + V_{i} + V_{i+1}$ for\n$0 \\leq i \\leq d$, where $V_{-1}=0$ and $V_{d+1}=0$; (iii) there exists an\nordering $\\{V^*_i\\}{i=0}^\\delta$ of the eigenspaces of $A^*$ such that $A V^*_i\n\\subseteq V^*_{i-1} + V^*_{i} + V^*_{i+1}$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq \\delta$, where\n$V^*_{-1}=0$ and $V^*_{\\delta+1}=0$; (iv) there is no subspace $W$ of $V$ such\nthat $AW \\subseteq W$, $A^* W \\subseteq W$, $W \\neq 0$, $W \\neq V$. We call\nsuch a pair a {\\it tridiagonal pair} on $V$. It is known that $d=\\delta$ and\nfor $0 \\leq i \\leq d$ the dimensions of $V_i$, $V_{d-i}$, $V^*_i$, $V^*_{d-i}$\ncoincide. The pair $A,A^*$ is called {\\it sharp} whenever $\\dim V_0=1$. It is\nknown that if $K$ is algebraically closed then $A,A^*$ is sharp. Assuming\n$A,A^*$ is sharp, we use the data $\\Phi=(A; \\{V_i\\}{i=0}^d; A^*;\n\\{V^*_i\\}{i=0}^d)$ to define a polynomial $P$ in one variable and degree at\nmost $d$. We show that $P$ remains invariant if $\\Phi$ is replaced by\n$(A;\\{V_{d-i}\\}{i=0}^d; A^*; \\{V^*_i\\}{i=0}^d)$ or $(A;\\{V_i\\}{i=0}^d; A^*;\n\\{V^*_{d-i}\\}{i=0}^d)$ or $(A^*; \\{V^*_i\\}{i=0}^d; A; \\{V_i\\}{i=0}^d)$. We call\n$P$ the {\\it Drinfel'd polynomial} of $A,A^*$. We explain how $P$ is related to\nthe classical Drinfel'd polynomial from the theory of Lie algebras and quantum\ngroups. We expect that the roots of $P$ will be useful in a future\nclassification of the sharp tridiagonal pairs. We compute the roots of $P$ for\nthe case in which $V_i$ and $V^*_i$ have dimension 1 for $0 \\leq i \\leq d$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 May 2008 10:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-13"}

Using a simple model optimized for\n\"typical\" galaxy-scale lenses, we generate four assessments of model quality\nthat are used in an automated classification. The robot infers the lens\nclassification parameter H that a human would have assigned; the inference is\nperformed using a probability distribution generated from a human-classified\ntraining set, including realistic simulated lenses and known false positives\ndrawn from the HST/EGS survey. We compute the expected purity, completeness and\nrejection rate, and find that these can be optimized for a particular\napplication by changing the prior probability distribution for H, equivalent to\ndefining the robot's \"character.\" Adopting a realistic prior based on the known\nabundance of lenses, we find that a lens sample may be generated that is ~100%\npure, but only ~20% complete. This shortfall is due primarily to the\nover-simplicity of the lens model. With a more optimistic robot, ~90%\ncompleteness can be achieved while rejecting ~90% of the candidate objects.
