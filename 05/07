The cause of these outbursts has thus far been\na mystery. One explanation is that they are initiated by kappa-effect\npulsations in the atmosphere caused by an increase in luminosity at\ntemperatures near the so-called ``iron bump'' (T ~ 200,000 K), where the Fe\nopacity suddenly increases. Due to a lag in the onset of convection, this\nluminosity can build until it exceeds the Eddington limit locally, seeding\npulsations and possibly driving some mass from the star. We present some\npreliminary results from a parameter study focusing on the conditions necessary\nto trigger normal S-Dor type (as opposed to extreme eta-Car type) outbursts. We\nfind that as Y increases or Z decreases, the pulsational amplitude decreases\nand outburst-like behavior, indicated by a large, sudden increase in\nphotospheric velocity, becomes likes likely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2008 17:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the past few years, there has been significant\nresearch on the game-theoretic issues that arise in an advertiser's interaction\nwith the mechanism as well as possible redesigns of the mechanism, but this\nranking order has remained standard.\n  From a search engine's perspective, the fundamental question is: what is the\nbest assignment of advertisers to slots? Here \"best\" could mean \"maximizing\nuser satisfaction,\" \"most efficient,\" \"revenue-maximizing,\" \"simplest to\ninteract with,\" or a combination of these. To answer this question we need to\nunderstand the behavior of a search engine user when she sees the displayed\nads, since that defines the commodity the advertisers are bidding on, and its\nvalue. Most prior work has assumed that the probability of a user clicking on\nan ad is independent of the other ads shown on the page.\n  We propose a simple Markovian user model that does not make this assumption.\nWe then present an algorithm to determine the most efficient assignment under\nthis model, which turns out to be different than that of GSP.

Further, we show that our assignment has many of the desirable\nproperties of GSP that makes bidding intuitive.

In recent years we have seen negative\nrefraction, focusing of light by a flat slab, a ``perfect'' prism, and an\n``invisibility cloak'' [1-6]. It is generally understood that the cause of this\nunusual behaviour is the strong (anomalous) dispersion, i.e., dependence of the\nmaterial properties on the frequency of light. Dispersion can be either due to\na natural microscopic resonance of the material as with surface\nplasmons-polaritons, or due to an effective resonance (band-gap) of the\nperiodic lattice as in photonics [7-9]. Metamaterials take the better of the\ntwo approaches representing a periodic array of designer subwavelength\nparticles tuned to resonate at a specific frequency-band. At present, however,\nwe have only a very basic understanding of the effect which a finite size of a\nsample of a periodic photonic crystal or metamaterial has on the macroscopic\nproperties such as refraction. Yet every finite dielectric object is a\nmoderate-quality resonator whose eigenmodes form a virtual photonic lattice\nwith its own angular band-gaps and preferred directions of propagation. Here we\nshow that this virtual lattice produces nontrivial real effects and that even a\nhomogeneous dielectric resonator may refract negatively without either negative\nor periodically modulated permittivity/permeability. We also propose a simple\nway to control the period of this virtual photonic lattice by varying the\ntransverse dimension of the resonator. Our research shows the importance of\nthree-dimensional resonant phenomena in optics and may result in new optical\ndevices with unusual properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2008 18:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-07"}

Dust\ninfluences the emission of water significantly by becoming optically thick at\nthe higher frequencies, and by pumping optically thin lines.

We have also found a systematic effect in the measured\nmass function due to the finite volume of simulations. In future work, this\nwill be included in the halo model to accurately predict the three point\ncorrelation function estimated from simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2008 06:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this\narticle, we introduce a game semantics for a fragment of first order\npropositional logic.

This\ncharacterization is usually done by restricting to the model to strategies\nsatisfying subtle combinatory conditions such as innocence, whose preservation\nunder composition is often difficult to show. Here, we present an original\nmethodology to achieve this task which requires to combine tools from game\nsemantics, rewriting theory and categorical algebra. We introduce a\ndiagrammatic presentation of definable strategies by the means of generators\nand relations: those strategies can be generated from a finite set of\n``atomic'' strategies and that the equality between strategies generated in\nsuch a way admits a finite axiomatization.

The reason that the range of validity is limited is that the theory\nrequires strong damping of all modes apart from the driven pattern-forming\nmodes. This is in conflict with the requirement for weak damping if three-wave\ncoupling is to influence pattern selection effectively.

The problem deals with the flow through the Micro-nip of\nmetering size press. The flow enters and exits at a tangential velocity of 20\nm/s between two rollers with diameter 80 cm and 60 -m apart. In the upper and\nbottom part of the domain the angular velocity is 314 rad /s. It has one\nsub-domain. Previous studies focus on the Micro-nip without considering the\ninertia and the viscoelasticity of the material. Roll coating is a technique\ncommonly used in the coating industry to meter a thin fluid film on a moving\nsubstrate. During the film formation, the fluid is subjected to very high shear\nand extensional rates over a very short period of time. The fluid domain\nchanges as a function of the hydrodynamic pressure within the nip as a result\nof the deformable cover usually used on one of the rolls. The free surface also\nadds more complexity to the flow due to the force equilibrium in the fluid gas\ninterface.

In\nthis paper, we present an acoustic wave actuated micro-generator for power\nsystem by using the energy of acoustic waves, such as the sound from human\nvoices or speakerphone, to actuate a MEMS-type electromagnetic transducer. This\nprovides a longer device lifetime and greater power system convenience.\nMoreover, it is convenient to integrate MEMS-based microgenerators with small\nor porta le devices\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2008 09:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

In principle, the open oven cavity\ncan be fitted directly onto a flip-chip or wafer scale bonder and, as such,\nwill allow for the bonding of devices through localised heating thus reducing\nthe risk to thermally sensitive devices. Variable frequency microwave (VFM)\nheating and curing of an idealised polymer load is numerically simulated using\na multi-physics approach. Electro-magnetic fields within a novel open ended\nmicrowave oven developed for use in micro-electronics manufacturing\napplications are solved using a de icated Yee scheme finite-difference\ntime-domain (FDTD) solver.

The analytic model of viscous evolution of an\nexternally truncated accretion \\alpha-disk is used. Relativistic effects near a\nKerr black hole and self-irradiation of an accretion disk are taken into\naccount. The model is applied to the outbursts of X-ray nova Monocerotis 1975\n(A 0620-00) and X-ray nova Muscae 1991 (GRS 1124-68). Comparison of\nobservational data with the model yields constraints on the angular momentum\n(the Kerr parameter) of the black holes in A 0620-00 and GRS 1124-68: 0.3-0.6\nand \\leq 0.4, and on the viscosity parameter \\alpha of the disks: 0.7-0.95 and\n0.55-0.75. We also conclude that the accretion disks should have an effective\ngeometrical thickness 1.5-2 times greater than the theoretical value of the\ndistance between the photometric layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2008 15:41:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 11:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
