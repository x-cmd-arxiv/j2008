In this paper we study the variant of\nthe multi-armed bandit problem where the exploration phase involves costly\nexperiments and occurs before the exploitation phase; and where each play of an\narm during the exploration phase updates a prior belief about the arm. The\nproblem of finding an inexpensive exploration strategy to optimize a certain\nexploitation objective is NP-Hard even when a single play reveals all\ninformation about an arm, and all exploration steps cost the same.\n  We provide the first polynomial time constant-factor approximation algorithm\nfor this class of problems. We show that this framework also generalizes\nseveral problems of interest studied in the context of data acquisition in\nsensor networks. Our analyses also extends to switching and setup costs, and to\nconcave utility objectives.\n  Our solution approach is via a novel linear program rounding technique based\non stochastic packing. In addition to yielding exploration policies whose\nperformance is within a small constant factor of the adaptive optimal policy, a\nnice feature of this approach is that the resulting policies explore the arms\nsequentially without revisiting any arm. Sequentiality is a well-studied\nconcept in decision theory, and is very desirable in domains where multiple\nexplorations can be conducted in parallel, for instance, in the sensor network\ncontext.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 May 2008 22:48:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 15:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-19"}

The Sun is a\nmoderately active star, and its corona differs from active stars: active\nstellar coronae have a double-peaked EM(T) with the hot peak at 8-20 MK, while\nthe non flaring solar corona has one peak at 1-2 MK.

We measure the disk-integrated\ntime-averaged emission measure, EM_F(T), of an unbiased sample of solar flares\nanalyzing uninterrupted GOES/XRS light curves over time intervals of one month.\nWe obtain the EM_Q(T) of quiescent corona for the same time intervals from the\nYohkoh/SXT data. To investigate how EM_F(T) and EM_Q(T) vary with the solar\ncycle, we evaluate them at different phases of the cycle (from Dec. 1991 to\nApr. 1998). Irrespective of the solar cycle phase, EM_F(T) appears like a peak\nof the distribution significantly larger than the values of EM_Q(T) for T~5-10\nMK. As a result the time-averaged EM(T) of the whole solar corona is\ndouble-peaked, with the hot peak, due to time-averaged flares, located at\ntemperature similar of that of active stars, but less enhanced. The EM_F(T)\nshape supports the hypothesis that the hot EM(T) peak of active coronae is due\nto unresolved solar-like flares. If this is the case, quiescent and flare\ncomponents should follow different scaling laws for increasing stellar\nactivity. In the assumption that the heating of the corona is entirely due to\nflares, from nano- to macro-flares, then either the flare distribution or the\nconfined plasma response to flares, or both, are bimodal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 May 2008 16:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A possible origin is the\ndevelopment of ferromagnetic correlations at the surface of these small\nsystems. To clarify these puzzling experimental observations, we have studied\nthe two-orbital double-exchange model near half-doping n=0.5, using open\nboundary conditions to simulate the surface of either bulk or nano-sized\nmanganites.

The topological properties of the VT of the SC and FCC crystals are\nunstable with respect to the introduction of noise, because the corresponding\npolyhedra are geometrically degenerate, whereas the tessellation of the BCC\ncrystal is topologically stable even against noise of small but finite\nintensity. For weak noise, the mean area of the perturbed BCC and FCC crystals\nVT increases quadratically with a. In the case of perturbed SCC crystals, there\nis an optimal amount of noise that minimizes the mean area of the cells.\nAlready for a moderate noise (a>0.5), the properties of the three perturbed VT\nare indistinguishable, and for intense noise (a>2), results converge to the\nPoisson-VT limit.

The spectra are characterized by He-like and H-like Ka emission lines\nfrom O to Fe, as well as L-shell emission lines from Fe. In quiescence, the\nspectra are dominated by the H-like Ka lines, whereas in outburst the He-like\nlines are as intense as the H-like lines. In outburst, the H-like Ka lines from\nO to Si are broad, with widths of 4--14 eV in Gaussian $\\sigma$ (1800--2300$\n{\\rm km s^{-1}}$). The large line widths, together with line profiles, indicate\nthat the line-emitting plasma is associated with the Keplerian disk and still\nretains the azimuthal bulk motion. In quiescence, the emission lines are\nnarrower, with a Gaussian $\\sigma$ of 1--3 eV (420--620$ {\\rm km s^{-1}}$). A\nslightly larger velocity for lighter elements suggests that the lines in\nquiescence are emitted from an ionizing plasma at the entrance of the boundary\nlayer, where the bulk motion of the optically thick accretion disk is converted\ninto heat due to friction. Using the line intensity ratio of He-like and H-like\nKa lines for each element, we have also investigated the temperature\ndistribution in the boundary layer both in quiescence and outburst. The\ndistribution of SS Cyg is found to be consistent with other dwarf novae\ninvestigated systematically with {\\it ASCA} data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 May 2008 12:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We further show that the\ntransition from the FFLO phase to the homogeneous balanced superfluid is\ndiscontinuous leading to phase separation. If the species have different\nmasses, the superfluid phase is favored when the lighter species is in excess.\nWe explore the implications of these findings for the properties of the\ntwo-component Fermi gas in the atomic trap geometry.
