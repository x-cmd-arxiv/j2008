The ability of the HST to peer\ninto the bright inner regions of galaxies and distinguish between globular\nclusters (GCs) and background objects has been particularly beneficial to the\nstudy of clusters. But the very virtue of the HST that has been an asset to\nsuch research can be its pitfall if the consequences of superior angular\nresolution are not considered in detail. Recent HST studies show a small, but\nconsistent, color-magnitude correlation in the metal-poor halo GCs of nearby\ngalaxies. This `blue-tilt' has been interpreted as a mass-metallicity\nrelationship, implying self-enrichment in the higher mass GCs. We show that the\n`blue-tilt' is likely the consequence of a small, but measurable with HST,\nmass-size relationship in GCs. The combined effects of Poisson noise and\nsurface brightness fluctuations can explain other apparent correlations of the\n`blue-tilt' with environment. Some HST based studies have similarly suggested\nthat the mean metallicity of the blue, metal-poor, halo clusters increases with\nhost galaxy mass, indicating that GC metallicity is linked to the size of the\nhost galaxy halo. We show that this correlation is also likely due to the\neffects of GC size in high resolution HST images.

The same holds true for the perturbation to the particle\nnumber density. A cosmological perturbation theory based on these particular\ngauge-invariant quantities is more precise than any earlier first-order\nperturbation theory. In particular, it explains star formation in a\nsatisfactory way, even in the absence of cold dark matter. In a baryon-only\nuniverse, the earliest stars, the so-called Population III stars, are found to\nhave masses between 400 and 100,000 solar masses with a peak around 3400 solar\nmasses. If cold dark matter, with particle mass 10 times heavier than the\nproton mass, is present then the star masses are between 16 and 4000 solar\nmasses with a peak around 140 solar masses. They come into existence between\n100 Myr and 1000 Myr. At much later times, star formation is possible only in\nhigh density regions, for example within galaxies. Late time stars may have\nmuch smaller masses than early stars. The smallest stars that can be formed\nhave masses of 0.2--0.8 solar mass, depending on the initial internal relative\npressure perturbation. It is demonstrated that the Newtonian theory of gravity\ncannot be used to study the evolution of cosmological density perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 May 2008 14:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 12:03:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 12:53:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2010 15:27:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2011 21:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

However, the\nACIS CCDs suffer from pileup when observing bright sources, and this creates\ndifficulties when trying to extract the scattered halo near the source. The\ninitial study of the X-ray halo around GX13+1 using only the ACIS-I detector\ndone by Smith, Edgar & Shafer (2002) suffered from a lack of sensitivity within\n50'' of the source, limiting what conclusions could be drawn.\n  To address this problem, observations of GX13+1 were obtained with the\nChandra HRC-I and simultaneously with the RXTE PCA. Combined with the existing\nACIS-I data, this allowed measurements of the X-ray halo between 2-1000''.\nAfter considering a range of dust models, each assumed to be smoothly\ndistributed with or without a dense cloud along the line of sight, the results\nshow that there is no evidence in this data for a dense cloud near the source,\nas suggested by Xiang et al. (2005). Finally, although no model leads to\nformally acceptable results, the Weingartner & Draine (2001) and nearly all of\nthe composite grain models from Zubko, Dwek & Arendt (2004) give poor fits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 May 2008 15:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
