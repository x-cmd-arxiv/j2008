We have re-analyzed our original VLT observations\n(Mignani et al. 2003), where a very faint object was tentatively detected close\nto the radio position, near the edge of a field galaxy. We found that the\nbackward extrapolation of the PSR J0108-1431 proper motion recently measured by\nCHANDRA(Pavlov et al. 2008) nicely fits the position of this object.

It is\nnoted that this matrix cannot always be diagonalized. It can however be brought\nby rotation to a matrix with equal diagonal elements. This equi-diagonal matrix\ncan then be squeeze-transformed to a rotation, to a squeeze, or to one of the\ntwo shear matrices. It is noted that these one-parameter matrices constitute\nthe basic elements of the Wigner's little group for space-time symmetries of\nelementary particles.

Both are sensitive to stellar mass; however, at fixed\nstellar mass, while colour is also highly sensitive to environment, morphology\ndisplays much weaker environmental trends. Only a small part of both relations\ncan be attributed to variation in the stellar mass function with environment.\nGalaxies with high stellar masses are mostly red, in all environments and\nirrespective of their morphology. Low stellar-mass galaxies are mostly blue in\nlow-density environments, but mostly red in high-density environments, again\nirrespective of their morphology.

We demonstrate that our red spirals primarily include galaxies\nwith true spiral morphology. We clearly show there is an environmental\ndependence for colour beyond that for morphology.

Similar to the NMSSM, the triplet gives an\nadditional contribution to the quartic coupling in the Higgs potential, and the\nmass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson can be greater than tne mass of the\nZ-bosn at tree-level. In addition to discussing the perturbativity,\nfine-tuning, and decoupling issues of this model, we compute the dominant\n1-loop corrections to the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson from the\ntriplet sector. When the Higgs-Higgs-Triplet coupling in the superpotential is\ncomparable to the top Yukawa coupling, we find that the Higgs mass can be as\nheavy as 140 GeV even without the traditional contributions from the top--s-top\nsector, and at the same time consistent with the precision electroweak\nconstraints.

In addition to having relatively small fine-tuning (about one\npart in 30), this leads to a gluo-philic Higgs boson whose production via\ngluon-gluon fusion at the LHC can be twice as large as the SM prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2008 21:20:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 May 2008 17:26:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2008 21:11:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2008 18:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Considerable effort has been\nexpended in the EDA community during the past several years in trying to cope\nwith the so-called statistical timing problem. Most of this effort has been\naimed at generalizing the static timing analyzers to the statistical case. In\nthis paper, we take a pragmatic approach in pursuit of making the Monte Carlo\nmethod for timing yield estimation practically feasible. The Monte Carlo method\nis widely used as a golden reference in assessing the accuracy of other timing\nyield estimation techniques. However, it is generally believed that it can not\nbe used in practice for estimating timing yield as it requires too many costly\nfull circuit simulations for acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach to constructing an improvedMonte Carlo estimator for timing\nyield which provides the same accuracy as the standard Monte Carlo estimator,\nbut at a cost of much fewer full circuit simulations. This improved estimator\nis based on a novel combination of a variance reduction technique, importance\nsampling, and a stochastic generalization of the logical effort formalism for\ncheap but approximate delay estimation. The results we present demonstrate that\nour improved yield estimator achieves the same accuracy as the standard Monte\nCarlo estimator at a cost reduction reaching several orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2008 21:54:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 May 2008 22:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

A PIC group decoding decodes the symbols embedded in\nan STBC by dividing them into several groups and decoding each group separately\nafter a linear PIC operation is implemented. It can be viewed as an\nintermediate decoding between the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver that decodes\nall the embedded symbols together, i.e., all the embedded symbols are in a\nsingle group, and the zero-forcing (ZF) receiver that decodes all the embedded\nsymbols separately and independently, i.e., each group has and only has one\nembedded symbol, after the ZF operation is implemented. Our proposed design\ncriterion for the PIC group decoding to achieve full diversity is an\nintermediate condition between the loosest ML full rank criterion of codewords\nand the strongest ZF linear independence condition of the column vectors in the\nequivalent channel matrix. We also propose asymptotically optimal (AO) group\ndecoding algorithm, which is an intermediate decoding between the MMSE decoding\nalgorithm and the ML decoding algorithm. The design criterion for the PIC group\ndecoding applies to the AO group decoding algorithm. It is well-known that the\nsymbol rate for a full rank linear STBC can be full, i.e., n_t for n_t transmit\nantennas. It has been recently shown that its rate is upper bounded by 1 if a\ncode achieves full diversity with a linear receiver. The intermediate criterion\nproposed in this paper provides the possibility for codes of rates between n_t\nand 1 that achieve full diversity with a PIC group decoding. This therefore\nprovides a complexity-performance-rate tradeoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2008 22:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-20"}

During this deceleration, any relative energy spread that is\ncreated at high energy is amplified by the ratio between high energy and dump\nenergy. Therefore, Energy Recovery Linacs are sensitive to energy spread\nacquired at high energy, e.g. from wake fields. One can compensate the\ntime-correlated energy spread due to wakes via energy-dependent time-of-flight\nterms in appropriate sections of an Energy Recovery Linac, and via\nhigh-frequency cavities. We show that nonlinear time-of-flight terms can only\neliminate odd orders in the correlation between time and energy, if these terms\nare created by a beam transport within the linac that is common for\naccelerating and decelerating beams. If these two beams are separated, so that\ndifferent beam transport sections can be used to produce time-of-flight terms\nsuitable for each, also even-order terms in the energy spread can be\neliminated. As an example, we investigate the potential of using this method\nfor the Cornell x-ray Energy Recovery Linac. Via quadratic time-of-flight\nterms, the energy spread can be reduced by 66%. Alternatively, since the energy\nspread from the dominantly resistive wake fields of the analysed accelerator is\napproximately harmonic in time, a high-frequency cavity could diminish the\nenergy spread by 81%. This approach would require bunch-lengthening and\nrecompression in separate sections for accelerating and decelerating beams.\nSuch sections have therefore been included in Cornell's x-ray Energy Recovery\nLinac design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 May 2008 00:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

On\ntop of the AGN continuum, we detect PAH emission from luminous star formation\nin nine objects individually as well as in the composite spectrum for the full\nsample. PAH luminosity and rest frame far-infrared luminosity correlate and\nextend the similar correlation for lower luminosity local QSOs. This provides\nstrong evidence for intense star formation in the hosts of these mm-bright\nQSOs, sometimes exceeding 1000 Msun/yr and dominating their rest frame\nfar-infrared emission. The PAH-based limit on star formation rates is lower for\nluminous z~2 QSOs that are not preselected for their mm emission. Partly\ndependent on systematic changes of the AGN dust covering factor and the dust\nspectral energy distribution of the AGN proper, the spectral energy\ndistributions of mm-faint high-z QSOs may be AGN dominated out to rest frame\nfar-infrared wavelengths. Towards the most luminous high-z QSOs, there is a\nflattening of the relation between star formation and AGN luminosity that is\nobserved for lower redshift QSOs. No QSO in our sample has a PAH-measured star\nformation rate in excess of 3000 Msun/yr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 May 2008 13:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Previous work has considered the WTM\nproblem in the high signal to interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) regime, where\nthe problem can be approximated and transformed into a convex optimization\nproblem through proper change of variables. In the general SINR regime,\nhowever, the approximation and transformation approach does not work. This\npaper proposes an algorithm, MAPEL, which globally converges to a global\noptimal solution of the WTM problem in the general SINR regime. The MAPEL\nalgorithm is designed based on three key observations of the WTM problem: (1)\nthe objective function is monotonically increasing in SINR, (2) the objective\nfunction can be transformed into a product of exponentiated linear fraction\nfunctions, and (3) the feasible set of the equivalent transformed problem is\nalways normal although not necessarily convex. The MAPLE algorithm finds the\ndesired optimal power control solution by constructing a series of polyblocks\nthat approximate the feasible SINR region in increasing precision. Furthermore,\nby tuning the approximation factor in MAPEL, we could engineer a desirable\ntradeoff between optimality and convergence time. MAPEL provides an important\nbenchmark for performance evaluation of other heuristic algorithms targeting\nthe same problem. With the help of MAPEL, we evaluate the performance of\nseveral respective algorithms through extensive simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 May 2008 15:04:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2008 12:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-10"}
