The applied functionals include the gradient corrected\nPBE and BLYP functional, and the corresponding hybrid Hartree-Fock density\nfunctionals HSE and B3LYP. We find that PBE based hybrid functionals\n(specifically HSE) yield, with the exception of Pt, the correct site order on\nall considered metals, but they also considerably overestimate the adsorption\nenergies compared to experiment. On the other hand, the semi-local BLYP\nfunctional and the corresponding hybrid functional B3LYP yield very\nsatisfactory adsorption energies and the correct adsorption site for all\nsurfaces. We are thus faced with a Procrustean problem: the B3LYP and BLYP\nfunctionals seem to be the overall best choice for describing adsorption on\nmetal surfaces, but they simultaneously fail to account well for the properties\nof the metal, vastly overestimating the equilibrium volume and underestimating\nthe atomization energies. Setting out from these observations, general\nconclusions are drawn on the relative merits and drawbacks of various\nsemi-local and hybrid functionals. The discussion includes a revised version of\nthe PBE functional specifically optimized for bulk properties and surface\nenergies (PBEsol), a revised version of the PBE functional specifically\noptimized to predict accurate adsorption energies (rPBE), as well as the\naforementioned BLYP functional.
