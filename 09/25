We identify protostellar candidates based\non their mid-infrared properties, correlate their positions with 1.1 mm core\npositions, and construct well-sampled SEDs using our extensive wavelength\ncoverage (lam=1.25-1100 micron). Source classification based on the bolometric\ntemperature yields a total of 39 Class 0 and 89 Class I sources in the three\ncloud sample. We compare to protostellar evolutionary models using the\nbolometric temperature-luminosity diagram, finding a population of low\nluminosity Class I sources that are inconsistent with constant or monotonically\ndecreasing mass accretion rates. This result argues strongly for episodic\naccretion during the Class I phase, with more than 50% of sources in a\n``sub-Shu'' (dM/dt < 1e-6 Msun/yr) accretion state. Average spectra are\ncompared to protostellar radiative transfer models, which match the observed\nspectra fairly well in Stage 0, but predict too much near-IR and too little\nmid-IR flux in Stage I. Finally, the relative number of Class 0 and Class I\nsources are used to estimate the lifetime of the Class 0 phase; the three cloud\naverage yields a Class 0 lifetime of 1.7e5 yr, ruling out an extremely rapid\nearly accretion phase. Correcting photometry for extinction results in a\nsomewhat shorter lifetime (1.1e5 yr). In Ophiuchus, however, we find very few\nClass 0 sources (N(Class0)/N(ClassI)=0.1-0.2), similar to previous studies of\nthat cloud. The observations suggest a consistent picture of nearly constant\naverage accretion rate through the entire embedded phase, with accretion\nbecoming episodic by at least the Class I stage, and possibly earlier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 16:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The large scale\nenvironment is classified into four web types: voids, sheets, filaments and\nknots. The classification is based on the evaluation of the deformation tensor,\ni.e. the Hessian of the gravitational potential, on a grid. The classification\nis based on counting the number of eigenvalues above a certain threshold,\nlambda_th at each grid point, where the case of zero, one, two or three such\neigenvalues corresponds to void, sheet, filament or a knot grid point. The\ncollection of neighboring grid points, friends-of-friends, of the same web\nattribute constitutes voids, sheets, filaments and knots as web objects.\n  A simple dynamical consideration suggests that lambda_th should be\napproximately unity, upon an appropriate scaling of the deformation tensor. The\nalgorithm has been applied and tested against a suite of (dark matter only)\ncosmological N-body simulations. In particular, the dependence of the volume\nand mass filling fractions on lambda_th and on the resolution has been\ncalculated for the four web types. Also, the percolation properties of voids\nand filaments have been studied.\n  Our main findings are: (a) Already at lambda_th = 0.1 the resulting web\nclassification reproduces the visual impression of the cosmic web. (b) Between\n0.2 < lambda_th < 0.4, a system of percolated voids coexists with a net of\ninterconected filaments. This suggests a reasonable choice for lambda_th as the\nparameter that defines the cosmic web. (c) The dynamical nature of the\nsuggested classification provides a robust framework for incorporating\nenvironmental information into galaxy formation models, and in particular the\nsemi-analytical ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 18:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

Loops that have similar kink\nfrequencies oscillate collectively with a frequency which is slightly different\nfrom that of the individual kink mode. On the other hand, if the kink frequency\nof a loop is different from that of the others, it oscillates individually with\nits own frequency. Since the individual kink frequency depends on the loop\ndensity but not on its radius for typical 1 MK coronal loops, a coupling\nbetween kink oscillations of neighboring loops take place when they have\nsimilar densities.

Consequently, low-energy excitations are\ndescribed in terms of auxiliary particles, representing combinations of\natomic-like electron configurations, rather than electron-like quasiparticles.\nThe introduction of a Lagrange Bose field is necessary to enable the treatments\nof these auxiliary particles as bosons or fermions. The condensation of the\nbosons results in static or dynamical inhomogeneities, and consequently in a\ncommensurate or an incommensurate resonance mode. The dynamics of the fermions\ndetermines the charge transport, and their strong coupling to the\nLagrange-field bosons results in pairing and superconductivity. The calculated\nresonance mode in hole-doped cuprates agrees with the experimental results, and\nis shown to be correlated with the pairing gap on the Fermi arcs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 17:36:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2008 16:15:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2010 13:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-09"}

The dataset contains\nthree large flaring episodes, the largest of these reaching a flux level of 7.2\n(+0.1,-0.2)*10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 3-10 keV band, which is a factor of\nthree times larger than flux levels typically seen in the system. Analysis of\nthese flares shows the X-ray emission from LS I +61 303 changing by up to a\nfactor of six over timescales of several hundred seconds as well as doubling\ntimes as fast as 2 seconds. This is the fastest variability ever observed from\nLS I +61 303 at this wavelength and places constraints on the size of the X-ray\nemitting region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 19:39:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2008 17:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The LMC is a rotating disk for which the viewing\nangles have been well-established using various methods. The disk is elliptical\nin its disk plane. The disk thickness varies depending on the tracer\npopulation, with V/sigma ranging from 2-10 from the oldest to the youngest\npopulation.

While a\nqubit is maximally entangled with rest of the system, two qubits are no longer\nentangled showing that the color code is genuinely multipartite entangled. For\na convex region, it is found that entanglement entropy depends only on the\ndegrees of freedom living on the boundary of two subsystems. The boundary\nscaling of entropy is supplemented with a topological subleading term which for\na color code defined on a compact surface is twice than the toric code. From\nthe entanglement entropy we construct a set of bipartitions in which the\ndiverging term arising from the boundary term is washed out, and the remaining\nnon-vanishing term will have a topological nature. Besides the color code on\nthe compact surface, we also analyze the entanglement properties of a version\nof color code with border, i.e \\emph{triangular color code}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2008 10:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 2008 12:12:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2008 08:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2008 20:37:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2008 16:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Assuming the distance of d ~\n5 kpc for J1601 as estimated for SNR G330.2+1.0, a small emission region of R ~\n1--2 km is implied. X-ray pulsations previously suggested by Chandra are not\nconfirmed by the XMM-Newton data, and are likely not real. However, our timing\nanalysis of the XMM-Newton data is limited by poor photon statistics, and thus\npulsations with a relatively low amplitude (i.e., an intrinsic pulsed-fraction\n< 40%) cannot be ruled out. Our results indicate that J1601 is a CCO similar to\nthat in the Cassiopeia A SNR.X-ray emission from SNR G330.2+1.0 is dominated by\npower law continuum (Gamma ~ 2.1--2.5) which primarily originates from thin\nfilaments along the boundary shell.

We show how a\nmulti-stable neuronal network containing a number of states can be created very\nsimply, by coupling two recurrent networks whose synaptic weights have been\nconfigured for soft winner-take-all (sWTA) performance. These two sWTAs have\nsimple, homogenous locally recurrent connectivity except for a small fraction\nof recurrent cross-connections between them, which are used to embed the\nrequired states. This coupling between the maps allows the network to continue\nto express the current state even after the input that elicted that state is\nwithdrawn. In addition, a small number of 'transition neurons' implement the\nnecessary input-driven transitions between the embedded states. We provide\nsimple rules to systematically design and construct neuronal state machines of\nthis kind. The significance of our finding is that it offers a method whereby\nthe cortex could construct networks supporting a broad range of sophisticated\nprocessing by applying only small specializations to the same generic neuronal\ncircuit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 22:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-16"}

Here it is shown that the difficulties in\naccounting for Jupiter's jets and thermal structure resolve if the effects of\ndifferential radiative heating and intrinsic heat fluxes are considered\ntogether, and if upper-tropospheric dynamics are linked to a\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) drag that acts deep in the atmosphere.

Remarkably, clusters with masses in the range\n10^4 to 10^6 solar mases show no systematic variation of radius with mass.\nHowever, recent observations have shown that clusters with masses greater than\n3x10^6 solar masses do show an increase in size with increasing mass. We point\nout that clusters with m>10^6 solar masses were optically thick to far infrared\nradiation when they formed, and explore the hypothesis that the size of\nclusters with m> 3x10^6 solar masses is set by a balance between accretion\npowered radiation pressure and gravity when the clusters formed, yielding a\nmass-radius relation r~0.3(m/10^6M_\\odot)^{3/5} pc. We show that the Jeans mass\nin optically thick objects increases systematically with cluster mass. We\nargue, by assuming that the break in the stellar initial mass function is set\nby the Jeans mass, that optically thick clusters are born with top heavy\ninitial mass functions; it follows that they are over-luminous compared to\noptically thin clusters when young, and have a higher mass to light ratio\nUpsilon_V=m/L_V when older than ~1 Gyr. Old, optically thick clusters have\nUpsilon_V~ mcl^{0.1-0.3}. It follows that L_V~\\sigma^{\\beta}, where \\sigma is\nthe cluster velocity dispersion, and \\beta~4.

The large number of spectra\nobtained of the object leads to one of the most extensive, near-infrared\nspectral studies of a classical nova. The spectra evolve from a P-Cygni phase\nto an emission-line phase and at a later stage is dominated by emission from\nthe dust that formed in this nova. A detailed model is computed to identify and\nstudy characteristics of the spectral lines. Inferences from the model address\nthe vexing question of which novae have the ability to form dust. It is\ndemonstrated, and strikingly corroborated with observations, that the presence\nof lines in the early spectra of low-ionization species like Na and Mg -\nindicative of low temperature conditions - appear to be reliable indicators\nthat dust will form in the ejecta. It is theoretically expected that mass loss\nduring a nova outburst is a sustained process. Spectroscopic evidence for such\na sustained mass loss, obtained by tracing the evolution of a P-Cygni feature\nin the Brackett gamma line, is presented here allowing a lower limit of 25-27\ndays to be set for the mass-loss duration. Photometric data recording the\nnova's extended 12 day climb to peak brightness after discovery is used to\nestablish an early fireball expansion and also show that the ejection began\nwell before maximum brightness.

In the majority of studies on CSMA wireless networks, a\ncontention graph is used to model the carrier sensing relationships (CS) among\nlinks. This is a 0-1 model in which two links can either sense each other\ncompletely or not. In real experiments, we observed that this is generally not\nthe case: the CS relationship between the links are often probabilistic and can\nvary dynamically over time. This is the case even if the distance between the\nlinks is fixed and there is no drastic change in the environment. Furthermore,\nthis partial carrier sensing relationship is prevalent and occurs over a wide\nrange of distances between the links. This observation is not consistent with\nthe 0-1 contention graph and implies that many results and conclusions drawn\nfrom previous theoretical studies need to be re-examined. This paper\nestablishes a more accurate CS model with the objective of laying down a\nfoundation for future theoretical studies that reflect reality. Towards that\nend, we set up detailed experiments to investigate the partial carrier sensing\nphenomenon.

They are investigated by studying the exact\ntwo-fields dynamics instead of assuming slow-roll. When the field values are\nrestricted to be less than the reduced Planck mass, a non-negligible part of\nthe initial condition space (around 15% depending on potential parameters)\nleads to successful inflation. Most of it is located outside the usual\ninflationary valley and organized in continuous patterns instead of being\nisolated as previously found. Their existence is explained and their properties\nare studied. This shows that no excessive fine-tuning is required for\nsuccessful hybrid inflation. Moreover, by extending the initial condition space\nto planckian-like or super-planckian values, inflation becomes generically\nsufficiently long and can produce a red-tilted scalar power spectrum due to\nslow-roll violations. The robustness of these properties is confirmed by\nconducting our analysis on three other models of hybrid-type inflation in\nvarious framework: \"smooth\" and \"shifted\" inflation in SUSY and SUGRA, and\n\"radion assisted\" gauge inflation.

Following a recent, decoherence-based, model fitting with this\ninterpretation, we investigate whether or not such model can be constructed.\nOur conclusions are somewhat surprising: only if the screen capturing the atoms\nin the experiment brings the information about the atomic-nucleus\ncenter-of-mass, one may construct the model desired. The nucleus $CM$ system is\nmonitored by the nucleus \"relative system ($R$)\". There appear the effective\n(the electrons-mediated) interaction between $CM$ and $R$ that is possibly\nresponsible for decoherence. For larger atoms, the interaction scales as $Z^2$\n($Z$ is the \"atomic number\"), being totally independent on the atomic mass. The\ninteraction selects the $CM$-wave-packet states as the approximate pointer\nbasis. Interestingly enough, the model stems nonoccurrence of decoherence due\nto the internal environment for the larger systems (such as the macromolecules\nand the macroscopic systems). Certainly, disproving this model (e.g. in an\nexperiment) stems the active role of the screen, which becomes responsible for\nthe \"$CM$ + spin\"-state \"reduction\" (\"collapse\"), i.e. for the irreversible\nretrieval of the classical information from the quantum world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2008 11:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-26"}

In particular we are interested in understanding the role played\nby the null directions of the linearized operator in the stability of the\ntraveling wave to perturbations of long wavelength.\n  A study of the normal form of the characteristic polynomial of the monodromy\nmap (the periodic Evan's function) in a neighborhood of the origin in the\nspectral plane leads to two different instability indices. The first index\ncounts modulo 2 the total number of periodic eigenvalues on the real axis. This\nindex is a generalization of the one which governs the stability of the\nsolitary wave. The second index provides a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor the existence of a long-wavelength instability.

These two indices together provide a good deal of information about\nthe spectrum of the linearized operator.\n  We sketch the connection of this calculation to a study of the linearized\noperator - in particular we perform a perturbation calculation in terms of the\nFloquet parameter.

It was rather regarded as a gravitationally bound\ntriple system but recent measurements of the HD 141569A radial velocity seem to\ninvalidate this hypothesis. The flyby scenario has therefore to be investigated\nto test its compatibility with the observations. We present a study of the\nflyby scenario for the HD141569 system, by considering 3 variants: a sole\nflyby, a flyby associated with one planet and a flyby with two planets. We use\nanalytical calculations and perform N-body numerical simulations of the flyby\nencounter. The binary orbit is found to be almost fixed by the observational\nconstraint on a edge-on plane with respect to the observers. If the binary has\nhad an influence on the disk structure, it should have a passing time at the\nperiapsis between 5000 and 8000 years ago and a distance at periapsis between\n600 and 900 AU. The best scenario for reproducing the disk morphology is a\nflyby with only 1 planet. For a 2 Mj (resp. 8 Mj) planet, its eccentricity must\nbe around 0.2 (resp. below 0.1). In the two cases, its apoapsis is about 130\nAU. Although the global disk shape is reasonably well reproduced, some features\ncannot be explain by the present model and the likehood of the flyby event\nremains an issue.

It is\nshown that periodic variations in column density in projection onto the primary\ncomponent take place at low inclinations of the binary plane to the line of\nsight. They can result in periodic extinction variations. Three periodic\ncomponents can exist in general case. The first component has a period equal to\nthe orbital one and is attributable to the streams of matter penetrating into\nthe inner regions of the binary. The second component has a period that is a\nfactor of 5-8 longer than the orbital one and is related to the density waves\ngenerated in a circumbinary (CB) disk. The third, longest period is\nattributable to the precession of the inner asymmetric region of CB disk. The\nrelationship between the amplitudes of these cycles depends on the model\nparameters as well as on the inclination and orientation of the binary in\nspace. We show that at a dust-to-gas ratio of 1:100 and and a mass extinction\ncoefficient of 250 cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$, the amplitude of the brightness variations\nof the primary component in the V-band can reach $1^m$ at a mass accretion rate\nonto the binary components of $10^{-8} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a $10^{\\rm o}$\ninclination of the binary plane to the line of sight.

In a minimal scenario, fermions\npropagate in the 5D RS subspace and their localization provides a model of\nflavor. New Kaluza-Klein (KK) states, corresponding to excitations of the gauge\nfields along the 6th dimension, appear near the TeV scale. The new gauge KK\nmodes behave differently from those in the 5D warped models.
