The chiral primary operators are sections of\nvector bundles, whose connection describes the operator mixing under motion on\nthe moduli space. This connection can be exactly computed using the constraints\nfrom N = (4,4) supersymmetry. Its curvature can be determined using the tt*\nequations, for which we give a derivation in the physical theory which does not\nrely on the topological twisting. We show that for N = (4,4) theories the\nchiral ring is covariantly constant over the moduli space, a fact which can be\nseen as a non-renormalization theorem for the three-point functions of chiral\nprimaries in AdS3/CFT2. From the spacetime point of view our analysis has the\nfollowing applications. First, in the case of a D1/D5 black string, we can see\nthe matching of the attractor flow in supergravity to RG-flow in the boundary\nfield theory perturbed by irrelevant operators, to first order away from the\nfixed point. Second, under spectral flow the chiral primaries become the Ramond\nground states of the CFT. These ground states represent the microstates of a\nsmall black hole in five dimensions consisting of a D1/D5 bound state. The\nconnection that we compute can be considered as an example of Berry's phase for\nthe internal microstates of a supersymmetric black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2008 17:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-27"}

The transients were optically faint (-13 < M_V < -15)\ncompared to normal core-collapse supernovae (SNe), and their spectra exhibited\nnarrow emission lines. These events are unique among transient-progenitor pairs\nand hence constitute a new class. Whether they are true SNe or bright\nmassive-star eruptions, we argue that their rate is ~20% of the SN rate. This\nfact is remarkable in light of the observation that a very small fraction of\nall massive stars have the MIR colors of the SN 2008S and NGC300 progenitors,\nas we show using MIR and optical luminosity, color, and variability properties\nof massive stars in M33. We find that the fraction of massive stars with colors\nconsistent with these progenitors is 1/10000. In fact, only < 10 similar\nobjects exist in M33 - all of which lie at the luminous red extremum of the AGB\nsequence. That these transients are relatively common with respect to SNe,\nwhile their progenitors are rare compared to the massive star population,\nimplies that the dust-enshrouded phase is a short-lived phase in the lives of\nmany massive stars. This shrouded epoch can occur only in the last ~10^4 yr\nbefore explosion, be it death or merely eruption. We discuss the implications\nof this finding for the evolution and census of ``low-mass'' massive stars\n(8-12 Msun), and we connect it with theoretical discussions of electron-capture\nSNe and the explosive birth of white dwarfs.

The\nexploitation of such a load margin is optimized by shaping the spectrum of the\ntransmitted cognitive signal.

In contrast to previous interferometer-based\nstudies, we find that the full molecular gas reservoir is situated in two\ncompact peaks separated by <~0.4\". Our observations reveal, for the first time,\nthat the emission from cold molecular gas is virtually cospatial with the\noptical/near-infrared continuum emission of the central AGN in this source.\nThis striking similarity in morphology indicates that the molecular gas is\nsituated in a compact region close to the AGN.

Even when the static\nproperties of a quantum system are known, its response to an explicitly\ntime-dependent variation of its parameters may be highly nontrivial, and\nqualitatively new states can appear that were absent in the original system. In\nquantum mechanics the archetype for this kind of behaviour is an atom in a\nradiation field, which exhibits a number of fundamental phenomena such as the\nmodification of its g-factor in a radio-frequency field and the dipole force\nacting on an atom moving in a spatially varying light field.

However,\nwhile H2 is generally the most important coolant at low gas densities, it is\nnot an effective coolant at high gas densities, owing to the low critical\ndensity at which it reaches local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and to the\nlarge opacities that develop in its emission lines. It is therefore possible\nthat emission from other chemical species may play an important role in cooling\nhigh density primordial gas. A particularly interesting candidate is the H3+\nmolecular ion. This ion has an LTE cooling rate that is roughly a billion times\nlarger than that of H2, and unlike other primordial molecular ions such as H2+\nor HeH+, it is not easily removed from the gas by collisions with H or H2. It\nis already known to be an important coolant in at least one astrophysical\ncontext -- the upper atmospheres of gas giants -- but its role in the cooling\nof primordial gas has received little previous study. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the potential importance of H3+ cooling in primordial gas using a\nnewly-developed H3+ cooling function and the most detailed model of primordial\nchemistry published to date. We show that although H3+ is, in most\ncircumstances, the third most important coolant in dense primordial gas (after\nH2 and HD), it is nevertheless unimportant, as it contributes no more than a\nfew percent of the total cooling. We also show that in gas irradiated by a\nsufficiently strong flux of cosmic rays or X-rays, H3+ can become the dominant\ncoolant in the gas, although the size of the flux required renders this\nscenario unlikely to occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 09:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is considered that Ga or Al selectively\ncreates disorder within the orbital domains or on its walls, causing\nenhancement of Griffiths phase (GP) singularity for the former and\ndisappearance of it in the later case. It is shown that Ga replaces Mn$^{3+}$\nwhich is considered to be concentrated within the domains, whereas Al replaces\nMn$^{4+}$ which is segregated on the hole-rich walls, without causing any\nsignificant effect on structure or ferromagnetic transition temperatures. Thus,\nit is presumed that the effect of disorder created by Ga extend across the bulk\nof the domain having correlation over similar length-scale resulting in\nenhancement of GP phenomenon. On the contrary, effect of disorder created by Al\nremains restricted to the walls resulting in the modification of the dynamics\narising from the domain walls and suppresses the GP. Moreover contrasting\nfeatures are observed in the low temperature region of the compounds; a\nre-entrant spin glass like behavior is observed in the Ga doped sample, while\nthe observed characteristics for the Al doped sample is ascribed only to\nmodified domain wall dynamics with the absence of any glassy phase. Distinctive\nfeatures in third order susceptibility measurements reveals that the magnetic\nground state of the entire series comprises of orbital domain states.

We prove that Kostant's cohomology formula holds for\nquantum groups at a generic parameter $q$, recovering an earlier result of\nMalikov in the case where the underlying semisimple Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g} =\n\\mathfrak{sl}(n)$. We also show that Kostant's formula holds when $q$ is\nspecialized to an $\\ell$-th root of unity for odd $\\ell \\ge h-1$ (where $h$ is\nthe Coxeter number of $\\mathfrak{g}$) when the highest weight of the\ncoefficient module lies in the lowest alcove. This can be regarded as an\nextension of results of Friedlander-Parshall and Polo-Tilouine on the\ncohomology of Lie algebras of reductive algebraic groups in prime\ncharacteristic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 15:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-15"}

Compared with the ADD\nmodel, this model provides a more satisfactory solution to the hierarchy\nproblem between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale, and it also avoids\nconstraints from astrophysics. Since there is no known analytic form of the\nKaluza-Klein spectrum for our choice of geometry, we obtain a spectrum based on\na combination of approximations and numerical computations. We study the\npossible signatures of our model for hadron colliders, especially the LHC,\nwhere the most important processes are the production of a graviton together\nwith a hadronic jet or a photon. We find that for the case of hadronic jet\nproduction, it is possible to obtain relatively strong signals, while for the\ncase of photon production, this is much more difficult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 15:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 07:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

In this way the renormalization\nprocedure is reduced to that for the boundary-free cosmic string spacetime.
