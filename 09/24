In this way we have covered many of\nthe standard theorems of bisimulation equivalence and congruence, both late and\nearly, and both strong and weak in a uniform manner. We thus provide one of the\nmost extensive formalisations of a process calculus ever done inside a theorem\nprover.\n  A significant gain in our formulation is that agents are identified up to\nalpha-equivalence, thereby greatly reducing the arguments about bound names.\nThis is a normal strategy for manual proofs about the pi-calculus, but that\nkind of hand waving has previously been difficult to incorporate smoothly in an\ninteractive theorem prover. We show how the nominal logic formalism and its\nsupport in Isabelle accomplishes this and thus significantly reduces the tedium\nof conducting completely formal proofs.

We find no clear demarcation between the\nradio-loud (RL, R > 10) and radio-quiet (RQ, R < 10) objects, but instead fill\nin a more radio-intermediate population in a continuous fashion for all\nsubsamples. We find that 4.7% of the AGN in the flux-limited subsample are RL\nbased on core radio emission alone. We calculate the radio-loud fraction (RLF)\nas both a function of black hole mass and Eddington ratio. The RLF decreases\n(from 13% to 2%) as Eddington ratio increases over 2.5 order of magnitude. The\nRLF is nearly constant (~5%) over 4 decades in black hole mass, except for an\nincrease at masses greater than 10^8 solar masses. We find for the FIRST\ndetected subsample that 367 of the RL AGN have black hole masses less than 10^8\nsolar masses, a large enough number to indicate that RL AGN are not a product\nof only the most massive black holes in the local universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2008 18:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Based on more than six years UVES/VLT spectroscopy the\nbinary frequency of brown dwarfs and (very) low-mass stars (M4.25-M8) in ChaI\nwas determined: it is 18% for the whole sample and 10% for the subsample of ten\nbrown dwarfs and VLMS (M < 0.1 Msun).

Now for the first time\ncompanion searches of (young) brown dwarfs cover the whole orbital separation\nrange and the following observational constraints for models of brown dwarf\nformation can be derived: (i) the frequency of brown dwarf and very low-mass\nstellar binaries at < 3 AU is not significantly exceeding that at > 3 AU; i.e.\ndirect imaging surveys do not miss a significant fraction of brown dwarf\nbinaries; (ii) the overall binary frequency of brown dwarfs and very low-mass\nstars is 10-30 %; (iii) the decline of the separation distribution of brown\ndwarfs towards smaller separations seem to occur between 1 and 3 AU; (iv) the\nobserved continuous decrease of the binary frequency from the stellar to the\nsubstellar regime is confirmed at < 3 AU providing further evidence for a\ncontinuous formation mechanism from low-mass stars to brown dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2008 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Two basic objectives are the\nsafety objective to stay forever in a given set of states, and its dual, the\nreachability objective to reach a given set of states. We present in this paper\na strategy improvement algorithm for computing the value of a concurrent safety\ngame, that is, the maximal probability with which player~1 can enforce the\nsafety objective. The algorithm yields a sequence of player-1 strategies which\nensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to the value of the\nsafety game.\n  Our result is significant because the strategy improvement algorithm\nprovides, for the first time, a way to approximate the value of a concurrent\nsafety game from below. Since a value iteration algorithm, or a strategy\nimprovement algorithm for reachability games, can be used to approximate the\nsame value from above, the combination of both algorithms yields a method for\ncomputing a converging sequence of upper and lower bounds for the values of\nconcurrent reachability and safety games.

Using simulations of the Clover\nexperiment, we compare the ability of modulated and un-modulated observations\nto recover the signature of gravitational waves in the polarized CMB sky in the\npresence of a number of anticipated systematic effects. The general\nexpectations that fast modulation is helpful in mitigating low-frequency\ndetector noise, and that the additional redundancy in the projection of the\ninstrument's polarization sensitivity directions onto the sky when modulating\nreduces the impact of instrumental polarization, are borne out by our\nsimulations. Neither low-frequency polarized atmospheric fluctuations nor\nsystematic errors in the polarization sensitivity directions are mitigated by\nmodulation. Additionally, we find no significant reduction in the effect of\npointing errors by modulation. For a Clover-like experiment, pointing jitter\nshould be negligible but any systematic mis-calibration of the polarization\ncoordinate reference system results in significant E-B mixing on all angular\nscales and will require careful control. We also stress the importance of\ncombining data from multiple detectors in order to remove the effects of\ncommon-mode systematics (such as 1/f atmospheric noise) on the measured\npolarization signal. Finally we compare the performance of our simulated\nexperiment with the predicted performance from a Fisher analysis.

Thus bulk flow estimates are generally not\nstrictly comparable between surveys, even those whose effective depths are\nsimilar. In addition, the sparseness of typical surveys can lead to aliasing of\nsmall scale power into what is meant to be a probe of the largest scales. Here\nwe introduce a new method of calculating bulk flow moments where velocities are\nweighted to give an optimal estimate of the bulk flow of an idealized survey,\nwith the variance of the difference between the estimate and the actual flow\nbeing minimized. These \"minimum variance\" estimates can be designed to estimate\nthe bulk flow on a particular scale with minimal sensitivity to small scale\npower, and are comparable between surveys. We compile all major peculiar\nvelocity surveys and apply this new method to them. We find that most surveys\nwe studied are highly consistent with each other. Taken together the data\nsuggest that the bulk flow within a Gaussian window of radius 50 Mpc/h is 407\nkm/s toward l=287 and b=8. The large-scale bulk motion is consistent with\npredictions from the local density field. This indicates that there are\nsignificant density fluctuations on very large scales. A flow of this amplitude\non such a large scale is not expected in the WMAP5-normalized LCDM cosmology,\nfor which the predicted one-dimensional r.m.s. velocity is ~110 km/s. The large\namplitude of the observed bulk flow favors the upper values of the WMAP5\nerror-ellipse, but even the point at the top of the WMAP5 95% confidence\nellipse predicts a bulk flow which is too low compared to that observed at >98%\nconfidence level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2008 22:22:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2008 17:47:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2008 19:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-24"}

In the high energy\nregime of X- and gamma-rays, outbursts with variability time-scales of seconds\nand faster are routinely observed, e.g. in gamma-ray bursts or Soft Gamma\nRepeaters. In the optical, flaring activity on such time-scales has never been\nobserved outside the prompt phase of GRBs. This is mostly due to the fact that\noutbursts with strong, fast flaring usually are discovered in the high-energy\nregime. Most optical follow-up observations of such transients employ\ninstruments with integration times exceeding tens of seconds, which are\ntherefore unable to resolve fast variability. Here we show the observation of\nextremely bright and rapid optical flaring in the galactic transient SWIFT\nJ195509.6+261406. Flaring of this kind has never previously been reported.

As the width is reduced, as in three\ndimensions, we find that the density of states approaches a common form, but\nthe two-peak behavior survives. Further, calculations of the participation\nratio show that most states are extended, although a smaller fraction of the\ndegrees of freedom are involved in these modes, compared to three dimensions.\nWe show that the fluctuation properties of these modes converges to those of\nthe Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices, in common with previous\nresults on three dimensional amorphous clusters and molecular liquids\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2008 23:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Dec 2008 22:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

When discretized at sub-atomic distances, the volume is inherently\nsparse. Noiseless measurements from an imaging technology can be modeled by\nconvolution of the image with the system point spread function (psf). Such is\nthe case with magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM), an emerging\ntechnology where imaging of an individual tobacco mosaic virus was recently\ndemonstrated with nanometer resolution. We also consider additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) in the measurements. Many prior works of sparse\nestimators have focused on the case when H has low coherence; however, the\nsystem matrix H in our application is the convolution matrix for the system\npsf. A typical convolution matrix has high coherence. The paper therefore does\nnot assume a low coherence H. A discrete-continuous form of the Laplacian and\natom at zero (LAZE) p.d.f. used by Johnstone and Silverman is formulated, and\ntwo sparse estimators derived by maximizing the joint p.d.f. of the observation\nand image conditioned on the hyperparameters. A thresholding rule that\ngeneralizes the hard and soft thresholding rule appears in the course of the\nderivation. This so-called hybrid thresholding rule, when used in the iterative\nthresholding framework, gives rise to the hybrid estimator, a generalization of\nthe lasso. Unbiased estimates of the hyperparameters for the lasso and hybrid\nestimator are obtained via Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE). A numerical\nstudy with a Gaussian psf and two sparse images shows that the hybrid estimator\noutperforms the lasso.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 04:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This is in marked contrast to\nthe behavior of metal mixed films, which suggests that the metal mixing process\nhas a significant effect of the physics of the superconducting state beyond\nthat achieved by reducing the film thickness alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 06:09:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 03:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-15"}

One feasible approach to these problems is to\ntransform them into their dual multiple access channel (MAC) problems, which\nare easier to deal with due to their convexity properties. The conventional\nBC-MAC duality is established via BC-MAC signal transformation, and has been\nsuccessfully applied to solve beamforming optimization,\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing, and capacity region\ncomputation. However, this conventional duality approach is applicable only to\nthe case, in which the base station (BS) of the BC is subject to a single sum\npower constraint. An alternative approach is minimax duality, established by Yu\nin the framework of Lagrange duality, which can be applied to solve the\nper-antenna power constraint problem. This paper extends the conventional\nBC-MAC duality to the general linear constraint case, and thereby establishes a\ngeneral BC-MAC duality. This new duality is applied to solve the capacity\ncomputation and beamforming optimization for the MIMO and multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) BC, respectively, with multiple linear constraints.\nMoreover, the relationship between this new general BC-MAC duality and minimax\nduality is also presented. It is shown that the general BC-MAC duality offers\nmore flexibility in solving BC optimization problems relative to minimax\nduality. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 06:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-25"}

We present a method of Taylor-series expansion to solve the\nlens equation under a small mass-ratio approximation. First, we investigate\nperturbative structures of a single-complex-variable polynomial, which has been\ncommonly used. Perturbative roots are found. Some roots represent positions of\nlensed images, while the others are unphysical because they do not satisfy the\nlens equation. This is consistent with a fact that the degree of the\npolynomial, namely the number of zeros, exceeds the maximum number of lensed\nimages if N=3 (or more). The theorem never tells which roots are physical (or\nunphysical). In this paper, unphysical ones are identified. Secondly, to avoid\nunphysical roots, we re-examine the lens equation. The advantage of our method\nis that it allows a systematic iterative analysis. We determine image positions\nfor binary lens systems up to the third order in mass ratios and for arbitrary\nN point masses up to the second order. This clarifies the dependence on\nparameters. Thirdly, the number of the images that admit a small mass-ratio\nlimit is less than the maximum number. It is suggested that positions of extra\nimages could not be expressed as Maclaurin series in mass ratios.\nMagnifications are finally discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 08:15:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2008 01:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nblock network error control coding framework, BNEC, is presented and the\ncapability of the scheme to correct a mixture of symbol errors and packet\nerasures and to detect symbol errors is studied. The idea of syndrome-based\ndecoding and error detection is introduced for BNEC, which removes the effect\nof input data and hence decreases the complexity. Next, an efficient\nthree-stage syndrome-based BNEC decoding scheme for network error correction is\nproposed, in which prior to finding the error values, the position of the edge\nerrors are identified based on the error spaces at the receivers. In addition\nto bounded-distance decoding schemes for error correction up to the refined\nSingleton bound, a complete decoding scheme for BNEC is also introduced.\nSpecifically, it is shown that using the proposed syndrome-based complete\ndecoding, a network error correcting code with redundancy order d for receiver\nt, can correct d-1 random additive errors with a probability sufficiently close\nto 1, if the field size is sufficiently large. Also, a complete maximum\nlikelihood decoding scheme for BNEC is proposed. As the probability of error in\ndifferent network edges is not equal in general, and given the equivalency of\ncertain edge errors within the network at a particular receiver, the number of\nedge errors, assessed in the refined Singleton bound, is not a sufficient\nstatistic for ML decoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 10:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-25"}

The results show that close to the Fermi level the shell\nstructure of a triangular flake is that of free massless particles, and that\ntriangles with an armchair edge show an additional sequence of levels (\"ghost\nstates\"). These levels result from the graphene band structure and the plane\nwave solution of the wave equation, and they are absent for triangles with an\nzigzag edge. All zigzag triangles exhibit a prominent edge state at the Fermi\nlevel, and few low-energy conduction electron states occur both in triangular\nand hexagonal flakes due to symmetry reasons. Armchair triangles can be used as\nbuilding blocks for other types of flakes that support the ghost states. Edge\nroughness has only a small effect on the level structure of the triangular\nflakes, but the effect is considerably enhanced in the other types of flakes.\nIn round flakes, the states near the Fermi level depend strongly on the flake\nradius, and they are always localized on the zigzag parts of the edge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 11:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Survival probability is typically associated with the 'fitness' of a\nparticular variation. In this paper we argue that the notion of fitness is an a\nposteriori concept, in the sense that one can assign higher fitness to species\nthat survive but one can generally not derive or even measure fitness - or\nfitness landscapes - per se. For this reason we think that in a 'physical'\ntheory of evolution such notions should be avoided. In this spirit, here we\npropose a random matrix model of evolution where selection mechanisms are\nencoded in the interaction matrices of species. We are able to recover some key\nfacts of evolution dynamics, such as punctuated equilibrium, i.e. the existence\nof intrinsic large extinctions events, and, at the same time, periods of\ndramatic diversification, as known e.g. from fossil records. Further, we\ncomment on two fundamental technical problems of a 'physics of evolution', the\nnon-closedness of its phase space and the problem of co-evolving boundary\nconditions, apparent in all systems subject to evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 14:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-25"}

To obtain the\ncorrect temperature structure, one needs full 3D hydrodynamical models. 3D\ncarbon abundances were determined for all three stars, using CO$^5$BOLD 3D\nhydrodynamical model atmospheres. 3D effects on the carbon abundance are found\nto be quite significant for these stars, with 3D corrections of up to --0.7\ndex. Two of the stars, SDSS J0912+0216 and SDSS J1349-0229 exhibit an\noverabundance of neutron capture elements which classifies them as CEMP-s. Star\nSDSS J1036+1212, instead belongs to the elusive class of CEMP-no/s stars, with\nenhanced Ba, but deficient Sr, of which it is the third member discovered to\ndate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 14:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-14"}

However, GWs have not\nyet been observed directly. The initial LIGO apparatus has not yet observed\nGWs. The Advanced LIGO (AdLIGO) will use a combination of improved techniques\nin order to increase the sensitivity. Along with power recycling and a higher\npower laser source, the AdLIGO will employ signal recycling (SR). While SR\nwould increase sensitivity, it would also reduce the bandwidth significantly.\nPreviously, we and others have investigated, theoretically and experimentally,\nthe feasibility of using a White Light Cavity (WLC) to circumvent this\nconstraint. However, in the previous work, it was not clear how one would\nincorporate the white light cavity effect. Here, we first develop a general\nmodel for Michelson-Interferometer based GW detectors that can be easily\nadapted to include the effects of incorporating a WLC into the design. We then\ndescribe a concrete design of a WLC constructed as a compound mirror, to\nreplace the signal recycling mirror. This design is simple, robust, completely\nnon-invasive, and can be added to the AdLIGO system without changing any other\noptical elements. We show a choice of parameters for which the signal\nsensitivity as well as the bandwidth are enhanced significantly over what is\nplanned for the AdLIGO, covering the entire spectrum of interest for\ngravitational waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 15:23:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2008 04:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 22:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2009 00:16:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2009 11:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-11"}
