We model the mirror as a gravitating Domain Wall and\nconsider a CFT coupled to it through gravity, in asymptotically Anti de Sitter\nspace. This problem (backreaction included) can be solved exactly at one loop.\nAt strong coupling, this is dual to a Domain Wall localized on the brane in the\nKarch-Randall model, which can be fully solved as well. Hence, in this case one\ncan see how the particle production is affected by A) strong coupling and B)\nits own backreaction. We find that A) the amount of CFT radiation at strong\ncoupling is not suppressed relative to the weak coupling result; and B) once\nthe boundary conditions in the AdS_5 bulk are appropriately mapped to the\nconditions for the CFT on the boundary of AdS_4, the Karch-Randall model and\nthe CFT side agree to leading order in the backreaction. This agreement holds\neven for a new class of self-consistent solutions (the `Bootstrap' Domain Wall\nspacetimes) that have no classical limit. This provides a quite precise check\nof the holographic interpretation of the Karch-Randall model. We also comment\non the massive gravity interpretation.\n  As a byproduct, we show that relativistic Cosmic Strings (pure tension\ncodimension 2 branes) in Anti de Sitter are repulsive and generate long-range\ntidal forces even at classical level. This is the phenomenon dual to particle\nproduction by Domain Walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 19:55:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2008 16:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-09"}

To this aim, we use a sample of dark matter\nonly and non-radiative SPH simulations of four massive clusters. The presence\nof gas-dynamical processes (e.g. ram-pressure from the hot ICM) makes haloes\nmore fragile in the runs which include gas. This results in a 25 per cent\ndecrease in the total number of subhaloes at z = 0. The impact on the galaxy\npopulation predicted by SAMs is complicated by the presence of \"orphan\"\ngalaxies, i.e. galaxies whose parent substructures are reduced below the\nresolution limit of the simulation. In the model employed in our study, these\ngalaxies survive for a residual merging time that is computed using a variation\nof the Chandrasekhar formula. Due to ram-pressure stripping, haloes in gas\nsimulations tend to be less massive than their counterparts in the dark matter\nsimulations. The resulting merging times for satellite galaxies are then longer\nin these simulations. On the other hand, the presence of gas influences the\norbits of haloes making them on average more circular and therefore reducing\nthe estimated merging times with respect to the dark matter only simulation.\nThis effect is particularly significant for the most massive satellites and is\n(at least in part) responsible for the fact that brightest cluster galaxies in\nruns with gas have stellar masses which are about 25 per cent larger than those\nobtained from dark matter only simulations. Our results show that gas-dynamics\nhas only a marginal impact on the statistical properties of the galaxy\npopulation, but that its impact on the orbits and merging times of haloes\nstrongly influences the assembly of the most massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 16:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, it is known that one should regard this P-Value\napproach with caution. As an alternative, we here examine a Bayesian approach\nto estimating the significance of a peak in a power spectrum. This approach\nrequires that we consider explicitly the hypothesis that the time series\ncontains a periodic signal as well as noise.

The high-mass star-forming region W3 IRS5 is a prime example of a young\nmassive cluster where the cluster center is resolved into multiple subsources\nat cm and infrared wavelengths, a potential proto-Trapezium system. The region\nW3 IRS5 was mapped with the PdBI at 1.4mm and 3.4mm in the AB configurations,\nobserving shock-tracing SiO and SO_2 emission.

Lower limits\nfor the circumstellar masses of the detected sources were calculated, although\nthey were strongly affected by the spatial filtering of the interferometer.\nHowever, the projected separations of the sources ranging between ~750 and\n~4700AU indicate a multiple, Trapezium-like system. We detected five molecular\noutflows in SiO, two of them nearly in the line of sight direction, which\nallowed us to see the collapsing protostars in the NIR through the cavities\ncarved by the outflows. The SO_2 velocity structure indicates a rotating, bound\nsystem, and we find tentative signatures of converging flows as predicted by\nthe gravoturbulent star formation and converging flow theories.

Moreover, the IMF\nand metallicity affect photometry as well. Due to their advanced evolutionary\nstate, globular clusters (GCs) are interesting test cases for cluster models\ndescribing these effects. In this paper we describe cluster models in which the\nabove effects are included. The photometric evolution of clusters is predicted,\nand the results are applied to Galactic GCs. The presented cluster models\nrepresent an analytical description of the evolution of the underlying stellar\nmass function due to stellar evolution and dynamical cluster dissolution.\nStellar remnants are included by using initial-remnant mass relations, while\ncluster photometry is computed from the Padova 1999 isochrones. Our study shows\nthat the preferential loss of low-mass stars, the retain of stellar remnants,\nas well as IMF and metallicity variations strongly influence the magnitude,\ncolour and mass-to-light ratio evolution of clusters. The different effects can\nbe clearly separated with our models. The models are applied to the Galactic GC\npopulation, of which the magnitude, colour and mass-to-light ratio ranges are\nwell reproduced. We also show that the mass-to-light ratios of clusters of\nsimilar ages and metallicities cannot be assumed to be constant for all cluster\nluminosities. Instead, mass-to-light ratio increases with cluster luminosity\nand mass. These models underline the importance of detailed cluster models when\nconsidering cluster photometry. With the analytic framework provided in this\npaper, observed cluster properties can be interpreted in a more complete\nperspective.

Such binaries form after major galaxy\nmergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering\nbecomes very inefficient at sub-parsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum\ntransport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated\nby disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick. The minimum merger time scale\nis shorter than the Hubble time for M < 10^7 Msun. This implies that gas discs\ncould commonly attend relatively low mass black hole mergers, and that a\nsignificant population of binaries might exist at separations of a few\nhundredths of a pc, where the combined decay rate is slowest. For more massive\nbinaries, we suggest that scattering of stars formed within a fragmenting gas\ndisc could act as a significant additional sink of binary angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 20:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 06:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-08"}

Mason formulated in twistor space. The rich structure of\ntwistor space results in greater gauge freedom compared to the theory in\nordinary space-time. One particular gauge choice, the CSW gauge, allows\nsimplifications to be made at both the classical and quantum level.\n  The equations of motion have an interesting form in the CSW gauge, which\nsuggests a possible solution procedure. This is explored in three special\ncases. Explicit solutions are found in each case and connections with earlier\nwork are examined. The equations are then reformulated in Minkowski space, in\norder to deal with an initial-value, rather than boundary-value, problem. An\ninteresting form of the Yang-Mills equation is obtained, for which we propose\nan iteration procedure.\n  The quantum theory is also simplified by adopting the CSW gauge. The Feynman\nrules are derived and are shown to reproduce the MHV diagram formalism\nstraightforwardly, once LSZ reduction is taken into account. The three-point\namplitude missing in the MHV formalism can be recovered in our theory.

In most great ape species, coalitions occur at\nindividual and group levels and among both kin and non-kin. Nonetheless, ape\nsocieties remain essentially hierarchical, and coalitions rarely weaken social\ninequality. In contrast, human hunter-gatherers show a remarkable tendency to\negalitarianism, and human coalitions and alliances occur not only among\nindividuals and groups, but also among groups of groups. Here, we develop a\nstochastic model describing the emergence of networks of allies resulting from\nwithin-group competition for status or mates between individuals utilizing\ndyadic information. The model shows that alliances often emerge in a phase\ntransition-like fashion if the group size, awareness, aggressiveness, and\npersuasiveness of individuals are large and the decay rate of individual\naffinities is small. With cultural inheritance of social networks, a single\nleveling alliance including all group members can emerge in several\ngenerations. Our results suggest that a rapid transition from a hierarchical\nsociety of great apes to an egalitarian society of hunter-gatherers (often\nreferred to as \"egalitarian revolution\") could indeed follow an increase in\nhuman cognitive abilities. The establishment of stable group-wide egalitarian\nalliances creates conditions promoting the origin of cultural norms favoring\nthe group interests over those of individuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 23:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this paper, we consider a new\nscheme of discrimination of quantum gates, called ancilla-assisted\ndiscrimination, in which a set of quantum gates on a $d-$dimensional system are\nperfectly discriminated with assistance from an $r-$dimensional ancilla system.\nThe main contribution of the present paper is two-fold: (1) The number of\nquantum gates that can be discriminated in this scheme is evaluated. We prove\nthat any $rd+1$ quantum gates cannot be perfectly discriminated with assistance\nfrom the ancilla, and there exist $rd$ quantum gates which can be perfectly\ndiscriminated with assistance from the ancilla. (2) The dimensionality of the\nminimal ancilla system is estimated. We prove that there exists a constant\npositive number $c$ such that for any $k\\leq cr$ quantum gates, if they are\n$d$-assisted discriminable, then they are also $r$-assisted discriminable, and\nthere are $c^{\\prime}r\\textrm{}(c^{\\prime}>c)$ different quantum gates which\ncan be discriminated with a $d-$dimensional ancilla, but they cannot be\ndiscriminated if the ancilla is reduced to an $r-$dimensional system. Thus, the\norder $O(r)$ of the number of quantum gates that can be discriminated with\nassistance from an $r-$dimensional ancilla is optimal. The results reported in\nthis paper represent a preliminary step toward understanding the role ancilla\nsystem plays in discrimination of quantum gates as well as the power and limit\nof superdense coding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2008 04:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-03"}

We demonstrate that\nthe shape of wave packet at arbitrary time depends on correlation between the\ninitial electron amplitudes $\\psi_1(\\vec r,0)$ and $\\psi_2(\\vec r,0)$ on the\nsublattices $A$ and $B$ correspondingly (i.e. pseudospin polarization). For the\ntransverse pseudospin polarization the motion of the center of wave packet\noccurs in the direction perpendicular to the average momentum $ {\\vec\np_0}=\\hbar \\vec{k_0}$. Moreover, in this case the initial wave packet splits\ninto two parts moving with opposite velocities along $ {\\vec p_0}$. If the\ninitial direction of pseudospin coincides with average momentum the splitting\nis absent and the center of wave packet is displaced at $t>0$ along the same\ndirection. The results of our calculations show that all types of motion\nexperience {\\it zitterbewegung}. Besides, depending on initial polarization the\nvelocity of the packet center may have the constant component $v_c=uf(a)$,\nwhere $u\\approx 10^8 cm/s$ is the Fermi velocity and $f(a)$ is a function of\nthe parameter $a=k_0d$ ($d$ is the initial width of wave packet). As a result,\nthe direction of the packet motion is determined not only by the orientation of\nthe average momentum, but mainly by the phase difference between the up- and\nlow- components of the wave functions. Similar peculiarities of the dynamics of\n2D electron wave packet connected with initial spin polarization should take\nplace in the semiconductor quantum well under the influence of the Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2008 08:20:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2008 11:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our studies reveal that the local structure (that varies\nwith polydispersity) plays a crucial role both in the slowing down of dynamics\nand in the growth of the dynamic heterogeneities, besides determining the glass\nforming ability (GFA) of the system. Increasing polydispersity at fixed volume\nfraction is found to suppress the rate of growth of dynamic correlations, as\ndetected by the growth in the peak of the non-linear density response function.\nThe growth in dynamical correlation is manifested in a stronger than usual\nbreakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation at lower polydispersity at low\ntemperatures and also leads to a decrease in the fragility of the system with\npolydispersity. We show that the suppression of the rate of growth of the\ndynamic heterogeneity can be attributed to the loss of structural correlations\n(as measured by the structure factor and the local bond orientational order)\nwith polydispersity.

We adopt the more intuitive approach due to\nKolmogorov (and subsequently, Landau in his text on fluid dynamics) and show\nthat how the 2D turbulence's results, obtainable using other methods, may be\nestablished in a simpler way. Same method is used to calculate some third-order\nstructure functions for quasi-geostrophic (QG) turbulence for the forward\ncascade of pseudo-potential enstrophy and the inverse energy cascade in\nquasi-geostrophic turbulence. These results motivate us to study the two-point\nthird order structure function in the context of the two-dimensionalisation\neffect. Consequent studies enable us to give a reason for the inverse energy\ncascade in the two-dimensionalised rapidly rotating three dimensional (3D)\nincompressible turbulence. For such a system, literature shows a possibility of\nthe exponent of wavenumber in the energy spectrum's relation to lie between -2\nand -3. We argue the existence of a stricter range of -2 to -7/3 for the\nexponent in the case of rapidly rotating turbulence which is in accordance with\nthe recent experiments. Also, a derivation for the two point third order\nstructure function has been provided helping one to argue that even with slow\nrotation one gets, although dominated, a spectrum with the exponent -2.87,\nthereby hinting at the initiation of the two-dimensionalisation effect with\nrotation. Moreover, using the Gledzer-Ohkitani-Yamada (GOY) shell model,\nmodified for rotation, these signatures of two-dimensionalisation effect have\nbeen verified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2008 09:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-10"}

The mentioned result was also known before the\nappearance of measure theory, but the original proof was very complicated. For\nthis reason this result, when presented in teaching, is generally obtained\nbased on measure theory.

The usual proof beyond the simple\ntools of the functional analysis, uses heavy embedding theorems and the Riesz'\nrepresentation theorem with the whole apparatus of measure theory.

Since metric type II bursts are thought to be signatures of\npropagating shock waves, it is of interest to know how these shocks, and the\ntype II bursts, are formed. In particular, how are high-frequency, fragmented\ntype II bursts created? Are there differences in shock acceleration or in the\nsurrounding medium that could explain the differences to the \"typical\" metric\ntype IIs? Methods: We analyse one unusual metric type II event in detail, with\ncomparison to white-light, EUV, and X-ray observations. As the radio event was\nassociated with a flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME), we investigate their\nconnection. We then utilize numerical MHD simulations to study the shock\nstructure induced by an erupting CME in a model corona including dense loops.\nResults: Our simulations show that the fragmented part of the type II burst can\nbe formed when a coronal shock driven by a mass ejection passes through a\nsystem of dense loops overlying the active region.To produce fragmented\nemission, the conditions for plasma emission have to be more favourable inside\nthe loop than in the interloop area. The obvious hypothesis, consistent with\nour simulation model, is that the shock strength decreases significantly in the\nspace between the denser loops. The later, more typical type II burst appears\nwhen the shock exits the dense loop system and finally, outside the active\nregion, the type II burst dies out when the changing geometry no longer favours\nthe electron shock-acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2008 11:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It consists of three\nsubgroups, Upper Scorpius (US), Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL), and Lower\nCentaurus-Crux (LCC) which have ages of about 5, 17, and 16 Myr. In Upper\nScorpius, numerous studies have recently revealed hundreds of low-mass\nassociation members, including dozens of brown dwarfs. The empirical mass\nfunction could be established over the full stellar mass range from 0.1 M_sun\nup to 20 M_sun, and was found to be consistent with recent determinations of\nthe field initial mass function. A narrow range of ages around 5 Myr was found\nfor the low-mass stars, the same age as had previously (and independently) been\nderived for the high-mass members. This supports earlier indications that the\nstar formation process in US was triggered, and agrees with previous\nconjectures that the triggering event was a supernova- and wind-driven\nshock-wave originating from the nearby UCL group. In the older UCL and LCC\nregions, large numbers of low-mass members have recently been identified among\nX-ray and proper-motion selected candidates. In both subgroups, low-mass\nmembers have also been serendipitously discovered through investigations of\nX-ray sources in the vicinity of better known regions (primarily the Lupus and\nTW Hya associations). While both subgroups appear to have mean ages of ~16 Myr,\nthey both show signs of having substructure. Their star-formation histories may\nbe more complex than that of the younger, more compact US group. ...

In Newtonian space,\nthe polarization angle must be either parallel or perpendicular to the\nprojection of the disc axis on the sky. As first pointed out by Stark and\nConnors in 1977, General Relativity effects strongly modify the polarization\nproperties of the thermal radiation as observed at infinity. Among these\neffects, the rotation of the polarization angle with energy is particularly\nuseful as a diagnostic tool.\n  In this paper, we extend the Stark and Connors calculations by including the\nspectral hardening factor, several values of the optical depth of the\nscattering atmosphere and rendering the results to the expected performances of\nplanned X-ray polarimeters. In particular, to assess the perspectives for the\nnext generation of X-ray polarimeters, we consider the expected sensitivity of\nthe detectors onboard the planned POLARIX and IXO missions. We assume the two\ncases of a Schwarzschild and an extreme Kerr black hole with a standard thin\ndisc and a scattering atmosphere.

Faraday\nrotation, measured between 3.6 and 6.2 cm at a linear resolution of 0.7 kpc,\nshows more variation in the south than in the north of the galaxy.

Under the assumption that the disk of M33 is flat, the\nregular magnetic field consists of horizontal and vertical components: however\nthe inferred vertical field may be partly due to a galactic warp.

Surprisingly, the\nsteady-state velocity and distance distributions for asymmetric interactions\nand driving terms agree with the equilibrium distributions of classical\nmany-particle systems with symmetrical interactions, if the system is large\nenough. This analytical result is confirmed by computer simulations and\nestablishes the possibility of approximating the steady state statistics in\ndriven many-particle systems by Hamiltonian systems.

Therefore, it is desirable to improve the spectral\nextraction software to both obtain more reliable results and enlarge the number\nof objects that can be studied. The new PICsIT spectral extraction method is\nbased on three elements: careful modelling of the background, an\nenergy-dependent pixel-illumination function, and the computation of the\nprobability density of the source count rate. The most important element is the\nproper treatment of the Poisson-distributed data, developed within a Bayesian\nframework.

The basic properties of the outflow, angular momentum\nflux and energy flux per particle in the wind, do not depend on the details of\nthe structure of the accretion disc.

We retain the earlier\nconstraints on the Skyrme force of reproducing the energy-density curve of\nneutron matter, and of having an isoscalar effective mass of $0.8M$ in\nsymmetric infinite nuclear matter at the saturation density; we also keep the\nrecently adopted device of dropping Coulomb exchange. Furthermore, the\ncorrection term for the spurious energy of collective motion has a form that is\nknown to favour fission barriers that are in good agreement with experiment.\nDespite the extra constraints on the effective force, we have achieved a better\nfit to the mass data than any other mean field model, the rms error on the 2149\nmeasured masses of nuclei with $N$ and $Z \\ge$ 8 having been reduced to 0.632\nMeV; the improvement is particularly striking for the most neutron-rich nuclei.\nMoreover, it turns out that even with no flexibility at all remaining for the\npairing force, the spectral pairing gaps that we find suggest that level\ndensities in good agreement with experiment should be obtained. This new force\nis thus particularly well-suited for astrophysical applications, such as\nstellar nucleosynthesis and neutron-star crusts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2008 15:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Here we analytically provide exact generalizations of\nsuch a point process in d-dimensional Euclidean space for any d, which are\nspecial cases of determinantal processes. In particular, we obtain the\nn-particle correlation functions for any n, which completely specify the point\nprocesses. We also demonstrate that spin-polarized fermionic systems have these\nsame n-particle correlation functions in each dimension. The point processes\nfor any d are shown to be hyperuniform. The latter result implies that the pair\ncorrelation function tends to unity for large pair distances with a decay rate\nthat is controlled by the power law r^[-(d+1)]. We graphically display one- and\ntwo-dimensional realizations of the point processes in order to vividly reveal\ntheir \"repulsive\" nature. Indeed, we show that the point processes can be\ncharacterized by an effective \"hard-core\" diameter that grows like the square\nroot of d. The nearest-neighbor distribution functions for these point\nprocesses are also evaluated and rigorously bounded. Among other results, this\nanalysis reveals that the probability of finding a large spherical cavity of\nradius r in dimension d behaves like a Poisson point process but in dimension\nd+1 for large r and finite d. We also show that as d increases, the point\nprocess behaves effectively like a sphere packing with a coverage fraction of\nspace that is no denser than 1/2^d.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2008 14:59:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 15:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2008 21:36:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2008 21:41:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2008 16:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This was accomplished by\nconsidering Stokes' flow within a droplet proceeding downstream to which we\nhave superimposed time dependent (sinusoidal) rotation. The mixing obtained is\nthe result of the stretching and folding of material lines which increase\nexponentially the surface contact between reagents. The mixing strategy relies\non the generation of resonances between the steady and the unsteady part of the\nflow, which is achieved by tuning the parameters of the periodic rotation. Such\nresonances, in our system, offer the possibility of controlling both the\nlocation and the size of the mixing region within the droplet, which may be\nuseful to manufacture inhomogeneous particles (such as Janus particles). While\nthe period and amplitude of the periodic rotation play a major role, it is\nshown here by using a triangular function that the particular shape of the\nrotation (as a function of time) has a minor influence.
