Following a previous Newtonian analysis\nof the production of a force-free magnetosphere in this way Timokhin et al.\n(2000), we present here a corresponding general-relativistic analysis. We give\na derivation of the general relativistic Maxwell equations for small-amplitude\narbitrary oscillations of a non-rotating neutron star with a generic magnetic\nfield and show that these can be solved analytically under the assumption of\nlow current density in the magnetosphere. We apply our formalism to toroidal\noscillations of a neutron star with a dipole magnetic field and find that the\nlow current density approximation is valid for at least half of the oscillation\nmodes, similarly to the Newtonian case. Using an improved formula for the\ndetermination of the last closed field line, we calculate the energy losses\nresulting from toroidal stellar oscillations for all of the modes for which the\nsize of the polar cap is small. We find that general relativistic effects lead\nto shrinking of the size of the polar cap and an increase in the energy density\nof the outflowing plasma. These effects act in opposite directions but the net\nresult is that the energy loss from the neutron star is significantly smaller\nthan suggested by the Newtonian treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2008 21:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2009 13:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is important to note that all problems are considered in the\nframework of classical mathematical statistics and, on the other hand, everyday\nmethods of data compression (or archivers) can be used as a tool for the\nestimation and testing. It turns out, that quite often the suggested methods\nand tests are more powerful than known ones when they are applied in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Sep 2008 15:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-09"}

By an appropriate contraction, we deduce the quenched\nLDP for the mean velocity of the particle and obtain a variational formula for\nthe corresponding rate function $I_q$. We propose an Ansatz for the minimizer\nof this formula. This Ansatz is easily verified when $d=1$.\n  In his 2003 paper, Varadhan proves the averaged LDP for the mean velocity and\ngives a variational formula for the corresponding rate function $I_a$. Under\nthe non-nestling assumption (resp. Kalikow's condition), we show that $I_a$ is\nstrictly convex and analytic on a non-empty open set $\\mathcal{A}$, and that\nthe true velocity $\\xi_o$ is an element (resp. in the closure) of\n$\\mathcal{A}$. We then identify the minimizer of Varadhan's variational formula\nat any $\\xi\\in\\mathcal{A}$.\n  For walks in high dimension, we believe that $I_a$ and $I_q$ agree on a set\nwith non-empty interior. We prove this for space-time walks when the dimension\nis at least 3+1. In the latter case, we show that the cheapest way to condition\nthe asymptotic mean velocity of the particle to be equal to any $\\xi$ close to\n$\\xi_o$ is to tilt the transition kernel of the environment Markov chain via a\nDoob $h$-transform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Sep 2008 15:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-09"}

At\n$q^2=0$, the final-state pion has an energy of approximately $m_K/2$ (for\n$m_K\\gg m_\\pi$) and so is not soft, nevertheless it is possible to compute the\nchiral logarithms, i.e. the corrections of $O(m_\\pi^2\\log(m_\\pi^2))$. We\nenvisage that our results at $q^2=0$ will be useful in extrapolating lattice\nQCD results to physical masses. A consequence of the Callan-Treiman relation is\nthat in the $\\SU(2)$ chiral limit ($m_u=m_d=0$), the scalar form factor $f^0$\nat $\\qsqmax$ is equal to $f^{(K)}/f$, the ratio of the kaon and pion leptonic\ndecay constants in the chiral limit. Lattice results for the scalar form factor\nat $\\qsqmax$ are obtained with excellent precision, but at the masses at which\nthe simulations are performed the results are about 25% below $f^{(K)}/f$ and\nare increasing only very slowly. We investigate the chiral behaviour of\n$f^0(\\qsqmax)$ and find large corrections which provide a semi-quantitative\nexplanation of the difference between the lattice results and $f^{(K)}/f$.
