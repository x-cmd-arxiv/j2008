We allow as many as three quarks\nto participate in nuclei, while fixing the mass of the electron and the average\nmass of the lightest baryon flavor multiplet. We classify as \"congenial\" worlds\nthat satisfy the environmental constraint that the quark masses allow for\nstable nuclei with charges one, six, and eight, making organic chemistry\npossible. Whether a congenial world actually produces observers depends on a\nmultitude of historical contingencies, beginning with primordial\nnucleosynthesis, which we do not explore. Such constraints may be independently\nsuperimposed on our results. Environmental constraints such as the ones we\nstudy may be combined with information about the a priori distribution of quark\nmasses over the landscape of possible universes to determine whether the\nmeasured values of the quark masses are determined environmentally, but our\nanalysis is independent of such an anthropic approach.\n  We estimate baryon masses as functions of quark masses and nuclear masses as\nfunctions of baryon masses. We check for the stability of nuclei against\nfission, strong particle emission, and weak nucleon emission. For two light\nquarks with charges 2/3 and -1/3, we find a band of congeniality roughly 29 MeV\nwide in their mass difference. We also find another, less robust region of\ncongeniality with one light, charge -1/3 quark, and two heavier, approximately\ndegenerate charge -1/3 and 2/3 quarks. No other assignment of light quark\ncharges yields congenial worlds with two baryons participating in nuclei. We\nidentify and discuss the region in quark-mass space where nuclei would be made\nfrom three or more baryon species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 19:16:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2008 16:09:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Feb 2009 14:49:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 23:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-04"}

The standard model field\ncontent, without the Higgs, is promoted to a 5D warped background. There is\nalso an additional 5D fermion with the quantum numbers of the right-handed top.\nLocalization of the zero-modes leads, at low energies, to a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel that also stabilizes the radion field dynamically thus explaining the\nhierarchy between the Planck scale and v_EW = 174 GeV. The top mass arises\ndynamically from the electroweak breaking condensate. The other standard model\nfermion masses arise naturally from higher-dimension operators, and the fermion\nmass hierarchies and flavor structure can be explained from the localization of\nthe zero-modes in the extra dimension. If any other contributions to the radion\npotential except those directly related with electroweak symmetry breaking are\nengineered to be suppressed, the KK scale is predicted to be about two orders\nof magnitude above the electroweak scale rendering the model easily consistent\nwith electroweak precision data.

We place this\nproblem in a cosmological context, deriving an expression for the linear\npotentials which control the cosmological bending of light, finding that it has\nno explicit dependence on the cosmological constant. To explore the physical\norigins of the apparent Lambda-dependent potential that appears in the static\nKottler metric, we highlight the two classical effects which lead to the\naberration of light. The first relates to the observer's motion relative to the\nsource, and encapsulates the familiar concept of angular-diameter distance. The\nsecond term, which has proved to be the source of debate, arises from cosmic\nacceleration, but is rarely considered since it vanishes for photons with\nradial motion. This apparent form of light-bending gives the appearance of\ncurved geodesics even within a flat and homogeneous universe. However this\ncannot be construed as a real lensing effect, since its value depends on the\nobserver's frame of reference. Our conclusion is thus that standard results for\ngravitational lensing in a universe containing Lambda do not require\nmodification, with any influence of Lambda being restricted to negligible\nhigh-order terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 16:46:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2009 14:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-16"}

The g,r,i colors of LRGs\nare inconsistent with stellar population models over the redshift range\n0.1<z<0.7. The g-r colors in the models are on average redder than the data\nwhile the r-i colors in the models are bluer towards low redshift. Beyond\nredshift 0.4, the predicted r-i color becomes instead too red, while the\npredicted g-r agrees with the data. We provide a solution to this problem,\nthrough a combination of new astrophysics and a fundamental change to the\nstellar population modeling. We find that the use of the empirical library of\nPickles (1998) instead of theoretical spectra modifies the predicted colors\nexactly in the way suggested by the data. The reason is a lower flux in the\nempirical libraries, with respect to the theoretical ones, in the wavelength\nrange 5500-6500 AA. The discrepancy increases with decreasing effective\ntemperature independently of gravity. This result has general implications for\na variety of studies from globular clusters to high-redshift galaxies. The\nastrophysical part of our solution regards the composition of the stellar\npopulations of these massive Luminous Red Galaxies. We find that on top of the\nprevious effect one needs to consider a model in which ~3% of the stellar mass\nis in old metal-poor stars. Other solutions such as substantial blue Horizontal\nBranch at high metallicity or young stellar populations can be ruled out by the\ndata. Our new model provides a better fit to the g-r and r-i colors of LRGs and\ngives new insight into the formation histories of these most massive galaxies.\nOur model will also improve the k- and evolutionary corrections for LRGs which\nare critical for fully exploiting present and future galaxy surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 20:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

When combined with\nspectroscopy and/or spectrophotometry, interferometry provides a powerful\nconstraint for model stellar atmospheres. Aims: The purpose of this work is to\ntest the robustness of the spherically symmetric version of the Atlas stellar\natmosphere program, SAtlas, using interferometric and spectrophotometric\nobservations. Methods: Cubes (three dimensional grids) of model stellar\natmospheres, with dimensions of luminosity, mass, and radius, are computed to\nfit observations for three evolved giant stars, \\psi Phoenicis, \\gamma\nSagittae, and \\alpha Ceti. The best-fit parameters are compared with previous\nresults. Results: The best-fit angular diameters and values of \\chi^2 are\nconsistent with predictions using Phoenix and plane-parallel Atlas models. The\npredicted effective temperatures, using SAtlas, are about 100 to 200 K lower,\nand the predicted luminosities are also lower due to the differences in\neffective temperatures. Conclusions: It is shown that the SAtlas program is a\nrobust tool for computing models of extended stellar atmospheres that are\nconsistent with observations. The best-fit parameters are consistent with\npredictions using Phoenix models, and the fit to the interferometric data for\n\\psi Phe differs slightly, although both agree within the uncertainty of the\ninterferometric observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 20:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These degeneracies\ngive rise to a substantial momentum dependence of the transverse g-factor in\nthe Zeeman coupling, turning the latter into a spin-orbit interaction.\n  I discuss a number of materials, where Zeeman spin-orbit coupling is likely\nto be present, and outline the simplest properties and experimental\nconsequences of this interaction, that may be relevant to systems from chromium\nto borocarbides, cuprates, hexaborides, iron pnictides, as well as organic and\nheavy fermion conductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 22:40:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2008 21:25:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2009 22:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-30"}

This does not\nrealistically model the Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction used in\npractice, in which bidders pay the next-highest bid for keywords that they are\nallocated. Towards the goal of more realistically modeling these auctions, we\nintroduce the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem, in which bidders' payments are\ndetermined by the GSP mechanism. We show that the complexity of the\nSecond-Price Ad Auctions problem is quite different than that of the more\nstudied First-Price Ad Auctions problem. First, unlike the first-price variant,\nfor which small constant-factor approximations are known, it is NP-hard to\napproximate the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem to any non-trivial factor,\neven when the bids are small compared to the budgets. Second, this discrepancy\nextends even to the 0-1 special case that we call the Second-Price Matching\nproblem (2PM). Offline 2PM is APX-hard, and for online 2PM there is no\ndeterministic algorithm achieving a non-trivial competitive ratio and no\nrandomized algorithm achieving a competitive ratio better than 2. This\ncontrasts with the results for the analogous special case in the first-price\nmodel, the standard bipartite matching problem, which is solvable in polynomial\ntime and which has deterministic and randomized online algorithms achieving\nbetter competitive ratios. On the positive side, we provide a 2-approximation\nfor offline 2PM and a 5.083-competitive randomized algorithm for online 2PM.\nThe latter result makes use of a new generalization of a result on the\nperformance of the \"Ranking\" algorithm for online bipartite matching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 23:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-12"}

Limited range sensing environment\narises in a sensing field prone to signal attenuation and path losses. The\ngeneral problem complements the widely considered decentralized detection\nproblem where all sensors observe the same object. In this paper we develop a\ndistributed detection approach based on recent development of the false\ndiscovery rate (FDR) and the associated BH test procedure. The BH procedure is\nbased on rank ordering of scalar test statistics. We first develop scalar test\nstatistics for multidimensional data to handle multi-modal sensor observations\nand establish its optimality in terms of the BH procedure. We then propose a\ndistributed algorithm in the ideal case of infinite attenuation for\nidentification of sensors that are in the immediate vicinity of an object. We\ndemonstrate communication message scalability to large SNETs by showing that\nthe upper bound on the communication message complexity scales linearly with\nthe number of sensors that are in the vicinity of objects and is independent of\nthe total number of sensors in the SNET. This brings forth an important\nprinciple for evaluating the performance of an SNET, namely, the need for\nscalability of communications and performance with respect to the number of\nobjects or events in an SNET irrespective of the network size. We then account\nfor finite attenuation by modeling sensor observations as corrupted by\nuncertain interference arising from distant objects and developing robust\nextensions to our idealized distributed scheme. The robustness properties\nensure that both the error performance and communication message complexity\ndegrade gracefully with interference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2008 00:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-12"}

The shape of the logN(>S)-logS is strongly\ndependent on the energy band with a general steepening apparent as we move to\nhigher energies. This is due to non-AGN populations, comprised mainly of stars\nand clusters of galaxies, contribute up to 30% of the source population at\nenergies <2 keV and at fluxes >10^{-13} erg/cm^2/s, and these populations of\nobjects have significantly flatter source count distributions than AGN.

The simulations\npresented include two-fluid models, which contain both cold and warm gas,\nalthough there is no heating or cooling between them. We find agglomeration is\npredominant when both the warm and cold components of the ISM are effectively\nstable to gravitational instabilities. In this case, the spacing (and\nconsequently mass) of clouds and spurs along the spiral arms is determined by\nthe orbits of the gas particles and correlates with their epicyclic radii (or\nequivalently spiral shock strength). Notably GMCs formed primarily by\nagglomeration tend to be unbound associations of many smaller clouds, which\ndisperse upon leaving the spiral arms. These GMCs are likely to be more massive\nin galaxies with stronger spiral shocks or higher surface densities. GMCs\nformed by agglomeration are also found to exhibit both prograde and retrograde\nrotation, a consequence of the clumpiness of the gas. At higher surface\ndensities, self gravity becomes more important in arranging both the warm and\ncold gas into clouds and spurs, and determining the properties of the most\nmassive GMCs. These massive GMCs can be distinguished by their higher angular\nmomentum, exhibit prograde rotation and are more bound. For a 20 M$_{\\odot}$\npc$^{-2}$ disc, the spacing between the GMCs fits both the agglomeration and\nself gravity scenarios, as the maximum unstable wavelength of gravitational\nperturbations in the warm gas is similar to the spacing found when GMCs form\nsolely by agglomeration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2008 09:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We explore the impact that X-ray ionizations\nhave on the power spectrum (PS) of 21-cm fluctuations by varying both the\naverage X-ray MFP and the fractional contribution of X-rays to reionization. In\ngeneral, prior to the epoch when the intergalactic medium is dominated by\nionized regions (H {\\sevensize II} regions), X-ray-induced ionization enhances\nfluctuations on spatial scales smaller than the X-ray MFP, provided that X-ray\nheating does not strongly supress galaxy formation. Conversely, at later times\nwhen \\H2 regions dominate, small-scale fluctuations in the 21-cm signal are\nsuppressed by X-ray ionization. Our modelling also shows that the modification\nof the 21-cm signal due to the presence of X-rays is sensitive to the relative\nscales of the X-ray MFP, and the characteristic size of \\H2 regions. We\ntherefore find that X-rays imprint an epoch and scale-dependent signature on\nthe 21-cm PS, whose prominence depends on fractional X-ray contribution. The\ndegree of X-ray heating of the IGM also determines the extent to which these\nfeatures can be discerned. We show that the MWA will have sufficient\nsensitivity to detect this modification of the PS, so long as the X-ray photon\nMFP falls within the range of scales over which the array is most sensitive\n($\\sim0.1$ Mpc$^{-1}$). In cases in which this MFP takes a much smaller value,\nan array with larger collecting area would be required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2008 11:20:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2009 06:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The\nmass and mass density profiles of these galaxies have been computed using the\nscientific computing s/w package MATLAB taking the already available velocity\nprofiles of the galaxies as the input, and without considering any Dark Matter\ncontribution. We have plotted these profiles after computing them according to\nthree different theories of gravity (and dynamics): Newtonian (black line),\nModified Newtonian Dynamics (MoND) (green line) and Vacuum Modified Gravity\n(red line).

We show that this assumption leads to very high turbulent\nenergies in convectively stable regions. The effect looks like overshooting,\nbut it is not, because turbulence is generated by pulsations. Also, turbulent\nelements do not carry kinetic nor thermal energy, into convectively stable\nlayers. The range of this artificial overshooting (as we shall call it) is as\nlarge as 6 local pressure scale heights, leading to unphysical internal damping\nthrough the eddy-viscous forces, in deep, convectively stable parts of the\nstar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2008 12:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-13"}

Finally, in the limit in which the DBI model reduces to the\nBogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) Abelian-Higgs model, we find that DBI\ncosmic strings are no longer BPS: rather they have positive binding energy. We\nthus argue that, when they meet, two DBI strings will not bind with the\ncorresponding formation of a junction, and hence that a network of DBI strings\nis likely to behave as a network of standard cosmic strings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2008 14:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-02"}

This ring represents a region of\nhigh density and pressure that is likely a transient and possibly turbulent\nstructure. Dynamical models suggest that the ring has formed as a result of a\nsudden increase in external pressure which is driving a compression wave into\nthe Globule. Here we combine the extinction measurements with a detailed study\nof the C18O (1-0) molecular line profiles toward Globule 2 in order to\ninvestigate the overall kinematics and, in doing so, test this dynamical model.\nWe find that the ring corresponds to an enhancement in the C18O non-thermal\nvelocity dispersion and non-thermal pressure. We observe a velocity gradient\nacross the Globule that appears to trace two distinct systematic subsonic\nvelocity flows that happen to converge within the ring. We suggest, therefore,\nthat the ring has formed as two subsonic flows of turbulent gas merge within\nthe Globule. The fact that the outer layers of the Globule appear stable\nagainst collapse yet there is no centrally condensed core, suggests that the\nGlobule may be evolving from the outside in and has yet to stabilize,\nconfirming its youth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2008 15:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
