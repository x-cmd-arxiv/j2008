This is in contrast to a large body of prior work\nin single-user, multiuser, and ad hoc wireless networks that have shown linear\nscaling is achievable when multiple receive and transmit antennas (i.e., MIMO\ntransmission) are employed, but that throughput increases logarithmically or\nsublinearly with nR when only a single transmit antenna (i.e., SIMO\ntransmission) is used. The linear gain is achieved by using the receive degrees\nof freedom to simultaneously suppress interference and increase the power of\nthe desired signal, and exploiting the subsequent performance benefit to\nincrease the density of simultaneous transmissions instead of the transmission\nrate. This result is proven in the transmission capacity framework, which\npresumes single-hop transmissions in the presence of randomly located\ninterferers, but it is also illustrated that the result holds under several\nrelaxations of the model, including imperfect channel knowledge, multihop\ntransmission, and regular networks (i.e., interferers are deterministically\nlocated on grids).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2008 16:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2009 01:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

We interpret these variations in term of changes\nof the relative abundance between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs,\nmid-IR band carriers) and very small grains (VSGs, mid-IR continuum carriers).\nWe conclude that the PAH/VSG abundance ratio is 2.4 times smaller at the peak\nemission of the Horsehead nebula than in the Cirrus case. For NGC2023 North\nwhere spectral evolution is observed across the northern PDR, we conclude that\nthis ratio is ~5 times lower in the dense, cold zones of the PDR than in its\ndiffuse illuminated part where dust properties seem to be the same as in\nCirrus.

One intends to show that the introduction of\nthe acceleration as a measure parameter gives an adequate scale for considering\nthe processes of massive particle emission. If the acceleration threshold is\nnot attained one is considering a regime where the processes of massive\nparticle production are suppressed. The analysis is performed in a\nsemiclassical formalism once applied in different contexts and already checked\nfor consistency in a serie of papers. As a further application of the results\nwe evaluate the possibility of a non negligible meson production by protons\naccelerated in the framework of polar cap models operating in electromagnetic\nfields of pulsars. It is shown that inside a systems endowed with magnetic\nfields B\\geq 10^{12} G the meson emission by protons must not be disregarded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2008 18:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2008 20:06:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2009 20:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 12:38:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 15:43:57 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 11:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-21"}

Although the escape\nprobabilities formally depend on a complicated combination of optical depth in\nthe lines and in the dust grains, we show that the cooling rate including dust\nis well approximated by the dust-free cooling rate multiplied by a simple\nfunction of the dust optical depth.

We extend our\ncomparison to select dIs in the Local Group (LG), and find only minor\ndifferences in SF parameters. The fraction of stars formed per time interval\nfor an average M81 Group and LG dI is consistent with a constant SFH.

We also\ncompare possible formation scenarios of the less luminous and candidate tidal\ndwarfs in the M81 Group. The SFHs and the lack of an overdensity of associated\nred stars suggest that the Garland and Ho IX are not dIs and are potentially\ntidal dwarf galaxies.

In the\npresent paper we attempt to quantify the cometary flux during the Late Heavy\nBombardment (LHB) to assess the likelihood of both scenarios. Our analysis\nrelies on the so-called Nice model of the origin of the LHB (Tsiganis et al.,\n2005; Morbidelli et al., 2005; Gomes et al., 2005) and on the size distribution\nof the primordial trans-Neptunian planetesimals constrained in Charnoz &\nMorbidelli (2007). We find that the cometary flux on Saturn during the LHB was\nso high that both scenarios for the formation of Saturn rings are viable in\nprinciple. However, a more detailed study shows that the comet tidal disruption\nscenario implies that all four giant planets should have comparable ring\nsystems whereas the destroyed satellite scenario would work only for Saturn,\nand perhaps Jupiter. This is because in Saturn\\'s system, the synchronous orbit\nis interior to the Roche Limit, which is a necessary condition for maintaining\na satellite in the Roche zone up to the time of the LHB.

From the joint analysis\nof the SZ and X-ray data, we derive physical properties such as gas mass, total\nmass, gas fraction and the intrinsic, integrated Compton y-parameter. We find\nthat parameters derived from the joint fit to the SZ and X-ray data agree well\nwith a detailed, independent X-ray-only analysis of the same clusters. In\nparticular, we find that, when combined with X-ray imaging data, this new\npressure profile yields an independent electron radial temperature profile that\nis in good agreement with spectroscopic X-ray measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2008 21:26:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2008 12:20:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2008 14:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2008 15:12:54 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 03:08:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

As the underlying\nSNII-L faded, SN2005ip exhibited a rich high-ionization spectrum with a dense\nforest of narrow coronal lines, unprecedented among SNe but reminiscent of some\nactive galactic nuclei.

For values of sigma between 90\nand 220km/s the 68% of our upper limits falls immediately above the MBH-sigma\nrelation without exceeding the expected MBH values by more than a factor 4.1.\nNo systematic trends or offsets are observed in this sigma range as a function\nof the galaxy Hubble type or with respect to the presence of a bar. For 6 of\nour 12 MBH upper limits with sigma<90km/s our line-width measurements are more\nsensitive to the stellar contribution to the gravitational potential, either\ndue to the presence of a nuclear stellar cluster or because of a greater\ndistance compared to the other galaxies at the low-sigma end of the MBH-sigma\nrelation. Conversely, our MBH upper bounds appear to lie closer to the expected\nMBH in the most massive elliptical galaxies with values of sigma above 220km/s.\nSuch a flattening of the MBH-sigma relation at its high-sigma end would appear\nconsistent with a coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies driven\nby dry mergers, although better and more consistent measurements for sigma and\nK-band luminosity are needed for these kind of objects before systematic\neffects can be ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2008 14:16:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2010 12:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The sharp peak at the temperature derivative of\nresistivity, signifying the first order nature of the phase transition in MnSi\nsuccessfully survived helium crystallization and continued the same way to the\nhighest pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2008 07:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Emphasis is\nplaced on fluid fields which, together with suitable derivatives, do not\nnecessarily decay at infinity and hence do not belong to Sobolev spaces. For\nthis purpose a novel approach based on a so-called inverse kinetic theory,\nrecently developed by Tessarotto and Ellero, is adopted. This requires the\nconstruction of a suitable kinetic equation, advancing in time a suitably\nsmooth kinetic distribution function and providing exactly, as its moment\nequations, the complete set of fluid equations. In turn, by proper definition\nof the kinetic equation, this permits the introduction of the so-called\n\\textit{Navier-Stokes dynamical system}, i.e., the dynamical system which\nadvances in time self-consistently the Navier-Stokes fluid fields.\nInvestigation of the properties of this dynamical system is crucial for the\nestablishment of an existence and uniqueness theorem for strong solutions of\nINSE. The new theorem applies both to bounded and unbounded domains and in the\npresence of generalized boundaries, represented by surfaces, curves or even\nsets of isolated points. In particular, for unbounded domains, solutions are\nconsidered, which do not necessarily vanish at infinity. Basic consequences for\nthe functional setting of classical solutions are analyzed.\n\\keywords{Navier-Stokes equations \\and Kinetic theory \\and Dynamical systems}\nPACS 47.10.ad,47.10.Fg,PACS 47.10.A- MSC 76D03,76D06\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2008 10:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-01"}

The CO emission is detected\nin the galactic disk and the extraplanar gas. The extraplanar CO emission\nfollows the morphology of the atomic gas closely but is less extended. The CO\nmaxima do not appear to correspond to regions where there is peak massive star\nformation as probed by Halpha emission. The presence of molecular gas is a\nnecessary but not sufficient condition for star formation. Compared to the disk\ngas, the molecular fraction of the extraplanar gas is 30% lower and the star\nformation efficiency of the extraplanar gas is about 3 times lower. The\ncomparison with an existing dynamical model extended by a recipe for\ndistinguishing between atomic and molecular gas shows that a significant part\nof the gas is stripped in the form of overdense arm-like structures. It is\nargued that the molecular fraction depends on the square root of the total\nlarge-scale density. Based on the combination of the CO/Halpha and an\nanalytical model, the total gas density is estimated to be about 4 times lower\nthan that of the galactic disk. Molecules and stars form within this dense gas\naccording to the same laws as in the galactic disk, i.e. they mainly depend on\nthe total large-scale gas density. Star formation proceeds where the local\nlarge-scale gas density is highest. Given the complex 3D morphology this does\nnot correspond to the peaks in the surface density. In the absence of a\nconfining gravitational potential, the stripped gas arms will most probably\ndisperse; i.e. the density of the gas will decrease and star formation will\ncease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2008 12:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In particular, if suitable encoders\nare employed, the use of decoding algorithm with manageable complexities is\npermitted. Maximum likelihood is an example of linear decoder. For a compound\nDMC, decoders that perform well without the channel's knowledge are required in\norder to achieve capacity. Several such decoders have been studied in the\nliterature. However, there is no such known decoder which is linear. Hence, the\nproblem of finding linear decoders achieving capacity for compound DMC is\naddressed, and it is shown that under minor concessions, such decoders exist\nand can be constructed. This paper also develops a \"local geometric analysis\",\nwhich allows in particular, to solve the above problem.

The study\nof efficient template banks, in the sense of using the smallest number of\ntemplates, is therefore of great practical interest. The \"traditional\" approach\nto template-bank construction requires every point in parameter space to be\ncovered by at least one template, which rapidly becomes inefficient at higher\ndimensions. Here we study an alternative approach, where any point in parameter\nspace is covered only with a given probability < 1. We find that by giving up\ncomplete coverage in this way, large reductions in the number of templates are\npossible, especially at higher dimensions. The prime examples studied here are\n\"random template banks\", in which templates are placed randomly with uniform\nprobability over the parameter space. In addition to its obvious simplicity,\nthis method turns out to be surprisingly efficient. We analyze the statistical\nproperties of such random template banks, and compare their efficiency to\ntraditional lattice coverings. We further study \"relaxed\" lattice coverings\n(using Zn and An* lattices), which similarly cover any signal location only\nwith probability < 1. The relaxed An* lattice is found to yield the most\nefficient template banks at low dimensions (n < 10), while random template\nbanks increasingly outperform any other method at higher dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2008 15:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}
