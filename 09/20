We identify several\ndistinct categories of high-ion absorption at velocities close to z_GRB: (i)\nStrong high-ion components at z_GRB itself are always seen in OVI, CIV, and\nSiIV, and usually (in 6 of 7 cases) in NV. We discuss circumburst and\ninterstellar models for the origin of this absorption.

We use the m=1 azimuthal Fourier mode between the 50% and 90% light\nradii as our measure of lopsidedness. The SDSS spectra are used to measure the\nproperties of the stars, gas, and black hole in the central-most few-kpc-scale\nregion. We show that there is a strong link between lopsidedness in the outer\nparts of the galactic disk and the youth of the stellar population in the\ncentral region. This link is independent of the other structural properties of\nthe galaxy. These results provide a robust statistical characterization of the\nconnections between accretion/interactions/mergers and the resulting star\nformation. We also show that residuals in the galaxy mass-metallicity relation\ncorrelate with lopsidedness (at fixed mass, the more metal-poor galaxies are\nmore lopsided). This suggests that the events causing lopsidedness and enhanced\nstar formation deliver lower metallicity gas into the galaxy's central region.\nFinally, we find that there is a trend for the more powerful active galactic\nnuclei to be hosted by more lopsided galaxies (at fixed galaxy mass, density,\nor concentration). However if we compare samples matched to have both the same\nstructures and central stellar populations, we then find no difference in\nlopsidedness between active and non-active galaxies. This leads to the\nfollowing picture. The presence of cold gas in the central region of a galaxy\n(irrespective of its origin) is essential for both star-formation and black\nhole growth. The delivery of cold gas is aided by the processes that produce\nlopsidedness.

Here we present numerical simulations that directly test these\nexpectations. Interestingly, we find that the Sheth & Tormen formalism for\nestimating the abundance of dark matter halos continues to work very well in\nits standard form for the Early Dark Energy cosmologies, contrary to analytic\npredictions. The residuals are even slightly smaller than for LCDM.

The whole cosmic population produces a\nstochastic background that could be detectable with upcoming Pulsar Timing\nArrays. Sources sufficiently close and/or massive generate gravitational\nradiation that significantly exceeds the level of the background and could be\nindividually resolved. We consider a wide range of massive black hole binary\nassembly scenarios, we investigate the distribution of the main physical\nparameters of the sources, such as masses and redshift, and explore the\nconsequences for Pulsar Timing Arrays observations. Depending on the specific\nmassive black hole population model, we estimate that on average at least one\nresolvable source produces timing residuals in the range ~5-50 ns.

We include one mode triplet consisting of the r-mode and two\nnear resonant inertial modes that couple to it. We find that the spectrum of\nevolutions is more diverse than previously thought. The evolution of the star\nis dynamic and initially dominated by fast neutrino cooling. Nonlinear effects\nbecome important when the r-mode amplitude grows above its first parametric\ninstability threshold. The balance between neutrino cooling and viscous heating\nplays an important role in the evolution. Depending on the initial r-mode\namplitude, and on the strength of the viscosity and of the cooling this balance\ncan occur at different temperatures. If thermal equilibrium occurs on the\nr-mode stability curve, where gravitational driving equals viscous damping, the\nevolution may be adequately described by a one-mode model. Otherwise, nonlinear\neffects are important and lead to various more complicated scenarios. Once\nthermal balance occurs, the star spins-down oscillating between thermal\nequilibrium states until the instability is no longer active.

However, scattering has\nnot been considered important to the production of pairs of planets in mean\nmotion resonances (MMRs). We present results from a large number of numerical\nsimulations of dynamical instabilities in 3-planet systems. We show that MMRs\narise naturally in about five percent of cases. The most common resonances we\npopulate are the 2:1 and 3:1 MMRs, although a wide variety of MMRs can occur,\nincluding high-order MMRs (up to eleventh order). MMRs are generated\npreferentially in systems with uneven mass distributions: the smallest planet\nis typically ejected after a series of close encounters, leaving the remaining,\nmore massive planets in resonance. The distribution of resonant planets is\nconsistent with the phase-space density of resonant orbits, meaning that\nplanets are randomly thrown into MMRs rather than being slowly pulled into\nthem. It may be possible to distinguish between MMRs created by scattering vs.\nconvergent migration in a gaseous disk by considering planetary mass ratios:\nresonant pairs of planets beyond ~1 AU with more massive outer planets are\nlikely to have formed by scattering.

The frequency of MMRs from scattering is comparable to\nthe expected survival rate of MMRs in turbulent disks.

The measurements have been performed in the film plane in the wide\ntemperature interval 4.5$\\div$300 K. They demonstrate that above films have\nlow-temperature anomaly below the percolation threshold for conductivity. The\nessence of the above peculiarity is that below 100 K the temperature dependence\nof coercive field for magnetization along easy direction deviates strongly from\nNeel-Brown law. At temperature lowering, the sharp increase of coercivity is\nobserved, accompanied by the appearance of coercive field for magnetization\nalong hard direction in the film plane. We establish that observed effect is\nrelated to the properties of individual ferromagnetic granules. The effect\nweakens as granules merge into conglomerates at $x$ higher then percolation\nthreshold and disappears completely at $x>1$. We explain the above effect as a\nconsequence of the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of granule and\ncover material. At temperature lowering this difference weakens the envelopment\nof an individual granule by the cover matrix material, thus permitting to\nrealize the spontaneous magnetostriction of a granule. The latter induces an\nadditional anisotropy with new easy axis of a granule magnetization along the\nexternal magnetic field direction. Our explanation is tested and corroborated\nby the ferromagnetic resonance measurements in the films at $T$ = 300 K and $T$\n= 77 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Sep 2008 12:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-23"}

Java applications are more\namenable to reverse engineering and re-engineering attacks through methods such\nas decompilation because Java class files store the program in a semi complied\nform called 'byte' codes. The existing obfuscation systems obfuscate the Java\nclass files. Obfuscated source code produce obfuscated byte codes and hence two\nlevel obfuscation (source code and byte code level) of the program makes it\nmore resilient to reverse engineering attacks. But source code obfuscation is\nmuch more difficult due to richer set of programming constructs and the scope\nof the different variables used in the program and only very little progress\nhas been made on this front. Hence programmers resort to adhoc manual ways of\nobscuring their program which makes it difficult for its maintenance and\nusability. To address this issue partially, we developed a user friendly tool\nJDATATRANS to obfuscate Java source code by obscuring the array usages. Using\nvarious array restructuring techniques such as 'array splitting', 'array\nfolding' and 'array flattening', in addition to constant hiding, our system\nobfuscate the input Java source code and produce an obfuscated Java source code\nthat is functionally equivalent to the input program. We also perform a number\nof experiments to measure the potency, resilience and cost incurred by our\ntool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Sep 2008 13:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-23"}
