A key feature of\nsuch interband pairing mechanism is that it can generate or enhance\nsuperconducting pairing irrespective of whether it is attractive or repulsive.\nThe latter case typically leads to the superconducting gap switching its sign\namong different sections of the Fermi surface. In iron pnictides, the natural\nscenario is that the gap changes sign between the hole and the electron Fermi\nsurfaces. However, the macroscopic symmetry of such an extended s'-wave state\nstill belongs to the general s-wave category, raising the question of how to\ndistinguish it from an ordinary s-wave. In such a quest, it is essential to use\nexperimental techniques that have a momentum space resolution and can probe\nmomenta of order M, the wavevector that separates the hole and the electron\nFermi surfaces in the Brillouin zone. Here we study experimental signatures in\nthe spin fluctuation dynamics of the fully-gapped s- and s'-wave\nsuperconducting states, as well as those of the nodal d- and p-wave. The\ncoupling between spin fluctuations of the incipient nearly-nested spin\ndensity-wave (SDW) and the Bogoliubov-deGennes quasiparticles of the\nsuperconducting state leads to the Landau-type damping of the former. The\nintrinsic structure of the superconducting gap leaves a distinctive signature\nin the form of this damping, allowing it to be used to diagnose the nature of\niron-based superconductivity in neutron scattering and other experiments\nsensitive to spin fluctuations in momentum space. We also discuss the\ncoexistence between superconductivity and SDW order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 15:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We find that early XRT\nafterglows show variability in excess of the Poissonian noise level on\ntime-scales as short as about 1 s (rest frame value), with the shortest t_{min}\nassociated with the highest energy band. The gamma-ray prompt emission of\nGRB080319B shows a characteristic average variability time-scale t_{var} of\nabout 1s; this parameter undergoes a remarkable evolution during the prompt\nemission (BAT observation).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 08:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These abundance peaks have a much\nbroader profile than the stars of the central brightest cluster galaxy (BCG),\nwhich produce the excess iron, indicating that metal-enriched plasma is\ntransported out of the BCG by some process such as turbulent diffusion. At the\nsame time, cooling-core clusters are likely heated by central active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs) by means of jets, cosmic-ray bubbles, and convection. The recent\nAGN-driven convection model of Chandran&Rasera predicts the turbulent velocity\nprofile in a steady-state cluster in which radiative cooling is balanced by\nheating from a combination of AGN-driven convection and thermal conduction. We\nuse the velocity profiles as input into an advection/diffusion model for the\ntransport of metals in the intracluster medium, taking the iron to be injected\nby the BCG. We compare the results of our model to XMM and Chandra observations\nof eight clusters. Assuming a constant turbulence level over a cluster's\nlifetime, the turbulent velocities in the model can explain the observed\nabundance profiles in only five of the eight clusters. However, we go on to\ndevelop an analytic fit of the turbulent velocity profile as a function of the\nAGN power. We then deduce for each cluster the average AGN power (during the\npast 10 Gyr) required to match the abundance profiles. The required average\nvalues are between 10^43 and 2.10^44 erg/s, while the present AGN powers span a\nmuch larger range from 6.10^41 (Virgo) to 2.10^44 erg/s (Hydra A). Our results\nsuggest that AGN-driven convection can account for the observed abundance\nprofiles if the AGN power varies over a cluster's lifetime between Virgo-like\nand Hydra-A-like values, with average values in the above-quoted range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 13:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Applying tomographic imaging techniques to time series of\nrotationally modulated circularly polarised profiles collected with the NARVAL\nspectropolarimeter, we determine the rotation period and reconstruct the\nlarge-scale magnetic topologies of 6 early M dwarfs. We find that early-M stars\npreferentially host large-scale fields with dominantly toroidal and\nnon-axisymmetric poloidal configurations, along with significant differential\nrotation (and long-term variability); only the lowest-mass star of our\nsubsample is found to host an almost fully poloidal, mainly axisymmetric\nlarge-scale field ressembling those found in mid-M dwarfs.\n  This abrupt change in the large-scale magnetic topologies of M dwarfs\n(occuring at spectral type M3) has no related signature on X-ray luminosities\n(measuring the total amount of magnetic flux); it thus suggests that underlying\ndynamo processes become more efficient at producing large-scale fields (despite\nproducing the same flux) at spectral types later than M3. We suspect that this\nchange relates to the rapid decrease in the radiative cores of low-mass stars\nand to the simultaneous sharp increase of the convective turnover times (with\ndecreasing stellar mass) that models predict to occur at M3; it may also be (at\nleast partly) responsible for the reduced magnetic braking reported for\nfully-convective stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 15:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The first argument\nstates that the behaviour of these clocks in the vicinity of a rotating\ngravitational source implies a non-geometric element of gravity. I argue that\nthe phenomenon is best seen as an instance of violation of the 'clock\nhypothesis', and therefore does not threaten the geometrical nature of\ngravitation. Ahluwalia's second argument, for the 'incompleteness' of general\nrelativity, involves the idea that flavour-oscillation clocks can detect\nconstant gravitational potentials.
