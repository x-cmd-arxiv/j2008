Although the dependence of this\nrelation on cosmological parameters is known to be weak, we retain the density\nparameter Omega_m in SCM equations, in order to study the limit Omega_m -> 0.\nWe show that in this regime the considered relation is strictly linear, for\narbitrary values of the density contrast, on the contrary to some claims in the\nliterature. On the other hand, we confirm that for realistic values of Omega_m\nthe exact relation in the SCM is well approximated by the classic formula of\nBernardeau (1992), both for voids (delta<0) and for overdensities up to delta ~\n3. Inspired by this fact, we find further analytic approximations to the\nrelation for the whole range delta from -1 to infinity. Our formula for voids\naccounts for the weak Omega_m-dependence of their maximal rate of expansion,\nwhich for Omega_m < 1 is slightly smaller that 3/2. For positive density\ncontrasts, we find a simple relation div v = 3 H_0 (Omega_m)^(0.6) [\n(1+delta)^(1/6) - (1+delta)^(1/2) ], that works very well up to the turn-around\n(i.e. up to delta ~ 13.5 for Omega_m = 0.25 and neglected Omega_Lambda). Having\nthe same second-order expansion as the formula of Bernardeau, it can be\nregarded as an extension of the latter for higher density contrasts. Moreover,\nit gives a better fit to results of cosmological numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2008 15:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

There are many\nsituations, however, in which the equilibrium state or periodic orbit is not\nisolated but belongs to a manifold $S$ of such states, typically as a result of\ncontinuous symmetries in the problem. In this case the bifurcation analysis\nrequires a combination of local and global methods, and is most tractable in\nthe case of normal nondegeneracy, that is when the degeneracy is only along $S$\nitself and the system is nondegenerate in directions normal to $S$.\n  In this paper we consider the consequences of relaxing normal nondegeneracy,\nwhich can generically occur within 1-parameter families of such systems. We pay\nparticular attention to the simplest but important case where $\\dim S=1$ and\nwhere the normal degeneracy occurs with corank 1. Our main focus is on uniform\ndegeneracy along $S$, although we also consider aspects of the branching\nstructure for solutions when the degeneracy varies at different places on $S$.\nThe tools are those of singularity theory adapted to global topology of $S$,\nwhich allow us to explain the bifurcation geometry in natural way.

They are candidates as molecular\nwires for nanotechnology applications in molecular electronics. The conduction\nin these polymers is due to the presence of delocalized molecular orbitals. In\nthis work, we present the synthesis of chloride doped polyaniline by bulk\noxidative chemical polymerization using a solid aniline salt as a monomer\ninstead of liquid aniline to diminish toxic hazards. The FTIR and UV-visible\nspectra confirmed the expected structure of the polymer. The electrical\nconductivity measured using a four-probe method was 1.7 S/cm. The dependence of\nimpedance modulus on frequency was measured using an HP impedance analyzer in\nthe range 10 kHz-13 MHz. The influence of doping and the preparation\ntemperature on the electrical conductivity were also investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2008 06:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-23"}
