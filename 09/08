Geometrically correlating these\ntwo scales constrains the soft SUSY breaking parameters of the MSSM. In this\nscenario, the hidden SUSY breaking sector involves an anomalous U(1)\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry which forbids bare mu and B mu terms. This sector\ntypically breaks supersymmetry at the desired range of energy scales through a\nsimple stringy hybrid of a Fayet and Polonyi model. A variant of the\nGiudice-Masiero mechanism generates the value mu ~ 10^2 - 10^3 GeV when the\nhidden sector scale of supersymmetry breaking is F^(1/2) ~ 10^(8.5) GeV.\nFurther, the B mu problem is solved due to the mild hierarchy between the GUT\nscale and Planck scale. These models relate SUSY breaking with the QCD axion,\nand solve the strong CP problem through an axion with decay constant f_a ~\nM_(GUT) * mu / L, where L ~ 10^5 GeV is the characteristic scale of gaugino\nmass unification in gauge mediated models, and the ratio \\mu / L ~\nM_(GUT)/M_(pl) ~ 10^(-3). We find f_a ~ 10^12 GeV, which is near the high end\nof the phenomenologically viable window. Here, the axino is the goldstino mode\nwhich is eaten by the gravitino. The gravitino is the LSP with a mass of about\n10^1 - 10^2 MeV, and a bino-like neutralino is (typically) the NLSP with mass\nof about 10^2 - 10^3 GeV. Compatibility with electroweak symmetry breaking also\ndetermines the value of tan(beta) ~ 30 +/- 7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2008 12:06:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2008 14:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 21:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The resulting cosmological equivalence\nprinciple is applied to the problem of synchronisation of clocks in the\nobserved universe. Once density perturbations grow to give density contrasts of\norder one on scales of tens of megaparsecs, the integrated deceleration of the\nlocal background regions of voids relative to galaxies must be accounted for in\nthe relative synchronisation of clocks of ideal observers who measure an\nisotropic cosmic microwave background. The relative deceleration of the\nbackground can be expected to represent a scale in which weak-field Newtonian\ndynamics should be modified to account for dynamical gradients in the Ricci\nscalar curvature of space. This acceleration scale is estimated using the\nbest-fit nonlinear bubble model of the universe with backreaction. At redshifts\nz < 0.25 the scale is found to coincide with the empirical acceleration scale\nof modified Newtonian dynamics. At larger redshifts the scale varies in a\nmanner which is likely to be important for understanding dynamics of galaxy\nclusters, and structure formation. Although the relative deceleration,\ntypically of order 10^{-10} m/s^2, is small, when integrated over the lifetime\nof the universe it amounts to an accumulated relative difference of 38% in the\nrate of average clocks in galaxies as compared to volume-average clocks in the\nemptiness of voids.

To achieve this, separate paths have\nto be provisioned to carry encoded packets, hence requiring either the addition\nof extra links, or reserving some of the resources for this purpose. In this\npaper, we propose network protection codes against a single link failure using\nnetwork coding, where a separate path using reserved links is not needed. In\nthis case portions of the link capacities are used to carry the encoded\npackets.\n  The scheme is extended to protect against multiple link failures and can be\nimplemented at an overlay layer. Although this leads to reducing the network\ncapacity, the network capacity reduction is asymptotically small in most cases\nof practical interest. We demonstrate that such network protection codes are\nequivalent to error correcting codes for erasure channels.

We show that extrapolation of this constant fraction into the\nreionisation epoch results in a reduction of 10-20% in the amplitude of 21-cm\nfluctuations over a range of spatial scales. The assumption of a different\npercentage during the reionisation era results in a proportional change in the\n21-cm fluctuation amplitude. We find that consideration of HI in galaxies/DLAs\nreduces the prominence of the HII region induced shoulder in the 21-cm power\nspectrum (PS), and hence modifies the scale dependence of 21-cm fluctuations.\nWe also estimate the 21cm-galaxy cross PS, and show that the cross PS changes\nsign on scales corresponding to the HII regions.

The index of the turbulence energy\nspectrum function beta = 2.0 in the shock-dominated phase. As the flow\napproaches statistical equilibrium, the spectrum flattens, with beta = 1.9.

We find that the case for M32 being a\nsatellite of M31 rests upon Hubble Space Telescope (HST) based stellar\npopulation studies which have resolved red-giant branch (RGB) and red clump\nstars in M32 as well as other nearby galaxies. Taken in isolation, this recent\nevidence could be considered to be conclusive in favour of the existing view.\nHowever, the conventional scenario does not explain M32's anomalously high\ncentral velocity dispersion for a dwarf galaxy (several times that of either\nNGC 147, NGC 185 or NGC 205) or existing planetary nebula observations (which\nsuggest that M32 is more than twice as distant as M31) and also requires an\nelaborate physical explanation for M32's inferred compactness. Conversely, we\nfind that the case for M32 being a normal galaxy, of the order of three times\nas distant as M31, is supported by: (1) a central velocity dispersion typical\nof intermediate galaxies, (2) the published planetary nebula observations, and\n(3) known scaling relationships for normal early-type galaxies. However, this\nnovel scenario cannot account for the high apparent luminosities of the RGB\nstars resolved in the M32 direction by HST observations. We are therefore left\nwith two apparently irreconcilable scenarios, only one of which can be correct,\nbut both of which suffer from potentially fatal evidence to the contrary.

Photodesorption is\na non-thermal desorption mechanism, which may explain the small amounts of\nobserved cold gas in cloud cores and disk mid-planes. This paper aims to\ndetermine the UV photodesorption yields and to constrain the photodesorption\nmechanisms of three astrochemically relevant ices: CO, N2 and CO2. In addition,\nthe possibility of co-desorption in mixed and layered CO:N2 ices is explored.\nThe ice photodesorption is studied experimentally under ultra high vacuum\nconditions and at 15-60 K using a hydrogen discharge lamp (7-10.5 eV). The ice\ndesorption during irradiation is monitored by reflection absorption infrared\nspectroscopy of the ice and simultaneous mass spectrometry of the desorbed\nmolecules. Both the UV photodesorption yields per incident photon and the\nphotodesorption mechanisms are molecule specific. CO photodesorbs without\ndissociation from the surface layer of the ice. N2, which lacks an electronic\ntransition in this wavelength range, has a photodesorption yield that is more\nthan an order of magnitude lower. This yield increases significantly due to\nco-desorption when N2 is mixed in with or layered on top of CO ice. CO2\nphotodesorbs through dissociation and subsequent recombination from the top 10\nlayers of the ice. At low temperatures (15-18 K) the derived photodesorption\nyields are 2.7x10^-3 and <2x10^-4 molecules photon-1 for pure CO and N2,\nrespectively. The CO2 photodesorption yield is 1.2x10^-3x(1-e^(-X/2.9)) +\n1.1x10^-3x(1-e^(-X/4.6)) molecules photon-1, where X is the ice thickness in\nmonolayers and the two parts of the expression represent a CO2 and CO\nphotodesorption pathway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2008 13:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2009 10:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nhas revealed that, in this plane, the distribution of galaxies looks like the\ntwo wings of a seagull. Galaxies in the right wing are referred to as\nSeyfert/LINERs, leading to the idea that non-stellar activity in galaxies is a\nvery common phenomenon. Here, we argue that a large fraction of the systems in\nthe right wing could actually be galaxies which stopped forming stars. The\nionization in these \"retired\" galaxies would be produced by hot post-AGB stars\nand white dwarfs. Our argumentation is based on a stellar population analysis\nof the galaxies via our STARLIGHT code and on photoionization models using the\nLyman continuum radiation predicted for this population. The proportion of\nLINER galaxies that can be explained in such a way is however uncertain. We\nfurther show how observational selection effects account for the shape of the\nright wing.
