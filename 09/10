A violation of these limits would\nconstitute a smoking gun for light BSM particles. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nhow R_T, the ratio of the partially integrated Higgs transverse momentum\ndistribution to the inclusive rate, can also be used as a probe of light BSM\nparticles. This ratio is insensitive to heavy virtual effects and can be\nwell-approximated by its SM value, i.e. it is model independent. The\nperturbative expansion for R_T has reduced renormalization scale dependence, at\nthe order of 5% at next-to-leading order in QCD, due to a cancellation of\nWilson coefficients. A deviation from the SM value implies that light BSM\nparticles are being produced near their mass shell. We discuss a possible\nloophole to this conclusion, namely the existence of a non-perturbative, CP\nviolating sector that couples to the Higgs. We use a toy model with colored\nscalars to demonstrate how the model independent prediction for R_T is\napproached as the mass of the scalar becomes large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 19:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-29"}

Our analysis was carried out using low-resolution NIR\nspectra acquired with the camera NICS at the TNG telescope, with JH and HK\ngrisms and a 1 arcsec-wide slit. These observational data were complemented\nwith infrared photometric data from the Spitzer space telescope archive. The\nrelevant physical properties of CB230-A were constrained by SED fitting of\nfluxes from the NIR to the mm. The YSO spectrum exhibits a significant number\nof atomic and molecular emission and absorption features. The characteristics\nof this spectrum suggest that we are observing a region in the close vicinity\nof CB230-A, i. e. its photosphere and/or an active accretion disk. The spectra\nof the knots in the jet contain a large number of emission lines, including a\nrich set of [FeII] lines. Emission due to H2 and [FeII] are not spatially\ncorrelated, confirming that [FeII] and H2 are excited by different mechanisms,\nin agreement with the models where [FeII] traces dissociative J-shocks and\nmolecular hydrogen traces slower C-shocks. By using intensity ratios involving\ndensity-sensitive [FeII] lines, we estimated the electron densities in the jet\n(6x10^3-1x10^4 cm^-3). This indicates either high density post-shock regions of\nionised gas or regions with a high degree of ionisation. By combining the\npresent data with previously obtained maps at NIR- and mm-wavelengths, the\nemerging scenario is that CB230-A is a Class 0/I YSO driving an atomic jet that\nis observed to be almost monopolar probably due to its inclination to the plane\nof the sky and the resulting higher extinction of its red side. This jet\nappears energetic enough to drive the molecular outflow observed in the mm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 16:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The interpretation of mixing-length theory\n(MLT) as generally used in astrophysics is incorrect; MLT forces the mixing\nlength to be an imposed constant. Direct tests show that the damping associated\nwith the flow is that suggested by Kolmogorov. The eddy size is approximately\nthe depth of the convection zone, and this dissipation length corresponds to\nthe \"mixing length\". New terms involving local heating by turbulent dissipation\nshould appear in the stellar evolution equations. The enthalpy flux\n(\"convective luminosity\") is directly connected to the buoyant acceleration,\nand hence the velocity scale. MLT tends to systematically underestimate this\nvelocity scale. Quantitative comparison with a variety of 3D simulations\nreveals a previously recognized consistency. Examples of application to stellar\nevolution will be presented in subsequent papers in this series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 18:27:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2008 20:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The QCT exactly partitions solvation free energies into\nthree components: 1) inner-shell chemical, 2) outer-shell packing, and 3)\nouter-shell long-ranged contributions. In this paper, we discuss efficient\nmethods for computing each of the three parts of the free energy. A Bayesian\nestimation approach is developed to compute the inner-shell chemical and\nouter-shell packing contributions. We derive upper and lower bounds on the\nouter-shell long-ranged portion of the free energy by expressing this component\nin two equivalent ways. Local, high energy contacts between solute and solvent\nare eliminated by spatial conditioning in this free energy piece, leading to\nnear-Gaussian distributions of solute-solvent interactions energies. Thus, the\naverage of the two mean-field bounds yields an accurate and efficient free\nenergy estimate. Aqueous solvation free energy results are presented for\nseveral solutes, including methane, perfluoromethane, water, and the sodium and\nchloride ions. The results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the\nmethods.

The absence of a strong\nbar indicates that the RR Lyrae in the bulge represent a different population\nthan the majority of the bulge stars, which are metal rich and are part of a\nbar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 19:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Generalising the model to finite anisotropy\nyields a better match to the data but the improvement is not significant and\nthe two additional parameters which are required to describe this model are not\njustified by the existing data. The extreme anisotropy we infer for the\nscintillation patterns must be attributed to the scattering medium rather than\na highly elongated source. For J1819+3845 the totally anisotropic model\npredicts that the particular radio flux variations seen between mid July and\nlate August should repeat between late August and mid November, and then again\nbetween mid November and late December as the Earth twice changes its direction\nof motion across the scintillation pattern. If this effect can be observed then\nthe minor-axis velocity component of the screen and the orientation of that\naxis can both be precisely determined. In reality the axis ratio is finite,\nalbeit large, and spatial decorrelation of the flux pattern along the major\naxis may be observable via differences in the pairwise fluxes within this\noverlap region; in this case we can also constrain both the major-axis velocity\ncomponent of the screen and the magnitude of the anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 00:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

However, in the alpha-model, these regions are also\nexpected to be thermally unstable. In this paper, we report two 3-d radiation\nMHD simulations of a vertically-stratified shearing box in which the ratio of\nradiation to gas pressure is ~ 10, and yet no thermal runaway occurs over a\ntimespan ~ 40 cooling times. Where the time-averaged dissipation rate is\ngreater than the critical dissipation rate that creates hydrostatic equilibrium\nby diffusive radiation flux, the time-averaged radiation flux is held to the\ncritical value, with the excess dissipated energy transported by radiative\nadvection. Although the stress and total pressure are well-correlated as\npredicted by the alpha-model, we show that stress fluctuations precede pressure\nfluctuations, contrary to the usual supposition that the pressure controls the\nsaturation level of the magnetic energy. This fact explains the thermal\nstability. Using a simple toy-model, we show that independently-generated\nmagnetic fluctuations can drive radiation pressure fluctuations, creating a\ncorrelation between the two while maintaining thermal stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 05:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

An age of 22.5+/-3.0 Myr and a distance of 3230^{+330}_{-430}\npc are derived for the cluster with a higher value of color excess ratio\nE(U-B)/E(B-V) than the normal one. There is an evidence for mass segregation in\nthis dynamically relaxed cluster with mass function slope is in agreement with\nthe Salpeter value. NIR and Halpha excess support the existence of a young (< 2\nMyr) stellar population of Herbig Ae/Be stars (> 3.0 M_sun) indicating a second\nepisode of star formation in the cluster region. Using XMM-Newton observations,\nwe found several X-ray sources in the cluster region but none of the Herbig\nAe/Be stars is detected in X-rays. We compare the distribution of upper limits\nfor Herbig Ae/Be stars with the X-ray distribution functions of the T-Tauri and\nthe Herbig Ae/Be stars from previous studies, and found that the X-ray emission\nlevel of these Herbig Ae/Be stars is not more than L_X ~5.2 x 10^{30} erg/s,\nwhich is not significantly higher than for the T-Tauri stars. Therefore, X-ray\nemission from Herbig Ae/Be stars could be the result of either unresolved\ncompanion stars or a process similar to T-Tauri stars. We report an extended\nX-ray emission from the cluster region NGC 7419, with a total L_X estimate of ~\n1.8 x 10^31 erg/s/arcmin^2. Investigation of dust and CO map of 1 degree region\naround the cluster indicates the presence of a foreground dust cloud which is\nmost likely associated with star forming region Sh2-154. This cloud harbors\nuniformly distributed pre main sequence stars (0.1-2.0M_sun) and the star\nformation in this cloud depend mostly upon the primordial fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 07:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In particular,\nlong-baseline interferometry, gravitational microlensing, extrasolar planet\ntransits, and many other observing techniques require accurate predictions of\nthe angular size of stars. These predictions are based on the surface\nbrightness-colour (SBC) relations. Aims: Our goal is to calibrate\ngeneral-purpose SBC relations using visible colours, the most commonly\navailable data for most stars. Methods: We compiled the existing long-baseline\ninterferometric observations of nearby dwarf and subgiant stars and the\ncorresponding broadband photometry in the Johnson B V and Cousins Rc Ic bands.\nWe then adjusted polynomial SBC models to these data. Results: Due to the\npresence of spectral features that depend on the effective temperature, the SBC\nrelations are usually not linear for visible colours. We present polynomial\nfits that can be employed with BVRcIc based colours to predict the\nlimb-darkened angular diameters (i.e. photospheric) of dwarf and subgiant stars\nwith a typical accuracy of 5%. Conclusions: The derived polynomial relations\nprovide a satisfactory approximation to the observed surface brightness of\nnearby dwarfs and subgiants.

We show that whether the rod falls into the\nslot as determined by Galilean kinematics is also valid under relativistic\nkinematics; this determination does not depend upon the magnitude of the\nvelocity, but only on the proper lengths and the proper angles of the rod and\nslot with the line of motion. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that the\npassing (or crashing) of the rod as a wholesome event is unaffected by\nrelativistic kinematics. We also provide a simple formula to determine whether\nor not the rod passes through the slot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 09:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-11"}

We study the DNA\noverstretching and unzipping transition using fully atomistic molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations and argue that the conformational changes of double\nstrand DNA associated with either of the above mentioned processes can be\nviewed as force induced DNA melting. As the force at one end of the DNA is\nincreased the DNA start melting abruptly/smoothly after a critical force\ndepending on the pulling direction.

These were jet simulations of a pulsed,\ninitially underdense jet in a high-density ambient medium. They were stopped\nwhen the jet reached a length of 50 AU. There, however, a transition of the\ninitially underdense jet towards an overdense jet should occur, which should\nresult in changed kinematics. Therefore, we describe two hydrodynamical\nsimulations with cooling beyond this density balance, one with the same\nparameters as model i in Paper I (now called model i'), which was presented\nthere with and without cooling, and the second with higher gas densities in the\njet pulses (model iv'). Hydrodynamical simulations, with a further approximated\ncooling treatment compared to Paper I, were used to be able to enlarge the\ncomputational domain. The transition causes changes in the expansion of the\ncocoon and therefore the morphology of the jet, e.g. a larger radial width of\nthe jet knots. We investigate the radiation properties of the jets, the\nbremsstrahlung and optical emissivities, integrated emission maps, and\nsynthetic absorption line profiles. The conclusion that the high observed\nvelocities in CH Cygni, R Aquarii, and MWC 560 favor the models with cooling is\nunchanged by the transition. The observed parallel features in R Aquarii can be\nproduced by the internal knots or by a variable dense radiative shell of\nshocked ambient medium. The absorption line profiles show that the real\nparameters in MWC 560 are closer to model iv' than to model i'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 11:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this\nregard, they are the nearest equivalents of young galaxies in the early\nUniverse.

In this sense (i.e., their gas has\nnot yet had time to settle into a regular disc), one could regard these\nextremely metal deficient (XMD) galaxies as `young'. The current star formation\nepisode is likely to have been triggered by interaction/merger. It is also\npossible that the tidal interaction has lead to enhanced mixing with metal-poor\ngas in outer disc, and hence to a low gas-phase metallicity in the central\nstar-forming regions.

The main approximation is to\nregard the interfaces separating domains as moving independently. While this is\ntrue in the non-conserved case, it is not in the conserved one. Our results can\ntherefore be considered as a first-order approximation for the distributions.\nIn contrast to the celebrated Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner distribution of\nstructures of the minority phase in the limit of very small concentration, the\ndistribution of domain areas in the 50:50 case does not have a cut-off. Large\nstructures (areas or perimeters) retain the morphology of a percolative or\ncritical initial condition, for quenches from high temperatures or the critical\npoint respectively. The corresponding distributions are described by a $c\nA^{-\\tau}$ tail, where $c$ and $\\tau$ are exactly known. With increasing time,\nsmall structures tend to have a spherical shape with a smooth surface before\nevaporating by diffusion.

It is\nan annulus with pure irrotational flow encircling a central low-density hole\naround which there is a macroscopic phase circulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 15:28:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2008 15:10:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 15:15:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 17:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-01"}

This modulation is then exploited to reveal the\nplanet's constant signal. In well-corrected ground-based observations we can\nreach planets six stellar magnitudes fainter than their sun, and only 2-3 times\nthe diffraction limit from it.

Felsner and Reuter defined the linear extension diameter of P\nas the distance between a diametral pair of linear extensions.\n  We show that computing the linear extension diameter is NP-complete in\ngeneral, but can be solved in polynomial time for posets of width 3.\n  Felsner and Reuter conjectured that, in every diametral pair, at least one of\nthe linear extensions reverses a critical pair. We construct a counterexample\nto this conjecture. On the other hand, we show that a slightly stronger\nproperty holds for many classes of posets: We call a poset \"diametrally\nreversing\" if, in every diametral pair, both linear extensions reverse a\ncritical pair. Among other results we show that interval orders and 3-layer\nposets are diametrally reversing.
