The commonly accepted way proceeds by formal analogy\nwith the expressions obtained when applying the generalized Wick theorem to the\nnon-diagonal matrix element of a Hamilton operator between two product states.\nIt is pointed out that this procedure is ill-defined when extended to EDF\ncalculations as the generalized Wick theorem is taken outside of its range of\napplicability.

A central question is how\nit is possible that so many initial configurations proceed to fold to a unique\nfinal configuration. We put energy and dynamical considerations temporarily\naside and focus upon the geometry alone. We parameterize the structure of an\nidealized protein using the concept of a ribbon from differential geometry. The\ndeformation of the ribbon is described by introducing a generic twisting\nAnsatz. The folding process in this picture entails a change in shape guided by\nthe local amino acid geometry. The theory is reparamaterization invariant from\nthe start, so the final shape is independent of folding time. We develop\ndifferential equations for the changing shape. For some parameter ranges, a\nsine-Gordon torsion soliton is found. This purely geometric waveform has\nproperties similar to dynamical solitons.

Kinematics-independent identification of the stellar types\nof the stars in such surveys (e.g. spectroscopic identification) could further\nimprove these results. We find that the observed asymmetry between ingoing and\noutgoing stars favors specific Galactic potential models. It also implies a\nlower limit of ~54+-8 main sequence HVSs in the survey sample (>=648+-96 in the\nGalaxy), assuming that all of the main sequence stars in the survey originate\nfrom the Galactic center. The other stars in the survey are likely to be hot\nblue horizontal branch stars born in the halo rather than stars ejected from\nthe Galactic center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2008 04:13:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 06:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by a\nfactor of 2.5. Comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopic\nredshifts (i.e. Delta z = zs - zp) indicates a dispersion of sigma_{Delta\nz/(1+zs)}=0.007 at i<22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlier\nphoto-z in the COSMOS, CFHTLS and COMBO-17 survey fields. At fainter magnitudes\ni<24 and z<1.25, the accuracy is sigma_{Delta z/(1+zs)}=0.012. The deep NIR and\nIRAC coverage enables the photo-z to be extended to z~2 albeit with a lower\naccuracy (sigma_{Delta z/(1+zs)}=0.06 at i~24). The redshift distribution of\nlarge magnitude-selected samples is derived and the median redshift is found to\nrange from z=0.66 at 22<i<22.5 to z=1.06 at 24.5<i<25.

Our\npreliminary results, based upon a new cross-correlation function (CCF)\nmethodology for determining the time-resolved spectral lag, are summarized as\nfollows. First, the evolution in the arrival offset of prompt gamma-ray photon\ncounts between Swift-BAT 15-25 keV and 50-100 keV energy bands (intrinsic\ngamma-ray spectral lag) appears to be anti-correlated with the arrival offset\nbetween prompt 15-350 keV gamma-rays and the optical emission observed by\nTORTORA (extrinsic optical/gamma-ray spectral lag), thus effectively\npartitioning the burst into two main episodes at ~T+28+/-2 sec. Second, prompt\noptical emission is nested within intervals of (a) trivial intrinsic gamma-ray\nspectral lag (~T+12+-2 and ~T+50+/-2 sec) with (b) discontinuities in the hard\nto soft evolution of the photon index for a power law fit to 15-150 keV\nSwift-BAT data (~T+8+/-2 and ~T+48+/-1 sec), both of which coincide with the\nrise (~T+10+/-1 sec) and decline (~T+50+/-1 sec) of prompt optical emission.\nThis potential discovery, robust across heuristic permutations of BAT energy\nchannels and varying temporal bin resolution, provides the first observational\nevidence for an implicit connection between spectral lag and the dynamics of\nshocks in the context of canonical fireball phenomenology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2008 04:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The ionization cone,\ndetected in the HeII4686/Hbeta and [OIII]5007/Hbeta line ratio maps, aligns\nwith the direction of the jet inferred from the bow-shock nebula. The cone has\nan opening angle ~45 deg and radial extent ~3.8 pc. Since the HeII emission\ncannot be explained by the companion O star, the gas in the ionization cone\nmust be exposed to the `naked' accretion disk, thereby allowing us to place\nconstraints on the unobservable ionizing spectrum. The energetics of the\nionization cone give unambiguous evidence for an \"ultraviolet - soft X-ray\"\n(XUV) excess in LMC X-1. Any attempt to match the hard X-ray spectrum (>1keV)\nwith a conventional model of the accretion disk fails to account for this XUV\ncomponent. We propose two likely sources for the observed anisotropy: (1)\nobscuration by a dusty torus, or (2) a jet-blown hole in a surrounding envelope\nof circumstellar absorbing material. We discuss the implications of our\ndiscovery in the context of the mass-scaling hypothesis for accretion onto\nblack holes and suggest avenues for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2008 06:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is assumed that the CR transmitter is\nequipped with multi-antennas, whereby transmit precoding and power control can\nbe jointly deployed to balance between avoiding interference at the PR\nterminals and optimizing performance of the CR link. This operation is named as\ncognitive beamforming (CB). Unlike prior study on CB that assumes perfect\nknowledge of the channels over which the CR transmitter interferes with the PR\nterminals, this paper proposes a practical CB scheme utilizing a new idea of\neffective interference channel (EIC), which can be efficiently estimated at the\nCR transmitter from its observed PR signals. Somehow surprisingly, this paper\nshows that the learning-based CB scheme with the EIC improves the CR channel\ncapacity against the conventional scheme even with the exact CR-to-PR channel\nknowledge, when the PR link is equipped with multi-antennas but only\ncommunicates over a subspace of the total available spatial dimensions.\nMoreover, this paper presents algorithms for the CR to estimate the EIC over a\nfinite learning time. Due to channel estimation errors, the proposed CB scheme\ncauses leakage interference at the PR terminals, which leads to an interesting\nlearning-throughput tradeoff phenomenon for the CR, pertinent to its time\nallocation between channel learning and data transmission. This paper derives\nthe optimal channel learning time to maximize the effective throughput of the\nCR link, subject to the CR transmit power constraint and the interference power\nconstraints for the PR terminals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2008 07:55:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 02:49:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2009 06:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-03"}

The impacts of interaction on galaxy properties are detected at\nleast out to the neighbor separation corresponding to the virial radius of\ngalaxies, which is typically between 200 and 400 h^{-1}kpc for the galaxies in\nour sample. To detect these long-range interaction effects it is crucial to\ndivide galaxy interactions into four cases dividing the morphology of target\nand neighbor galaxies into early and late types. We show that there are two\ncharacteristic neighbor-separation scales where the galaxy interactions cause\nabrupt changes in the properties of galaxies. The first scale is the virial\nradius of the nearest neighbor galaxy r_{vir,nei}. Many physical parameters\nstart to deviate from those of extremely isolated galaxies at the projected\nneighbor separation r_p of about r_{vir,nei}. The second scale is at r_p\n\\approx 0.05 r_{vir,nei} = 10--20 h^{-1} kpc, and is the scale at which the\ngalaxies in pairs start to merge. We find that late-type neighbors enhance the\nstar formation activity of galaxies while early-type neighbors reduce it, and\nthat these effects occur within r_{vir,nei}. The hot halo gas and cold disk gas\nmust be participating in the interactions at separations less than the virial\nradius of the galaxy plus dark halo system. Our results also show that the role\nof the large-scale density in determining galaxy properties is minimal once\nluminosity and morphology are fixed.

The nature of this X-ray\nfeature is unknown, and even its association with pulsar B2224+65 is unclear.\nAims: We attempt to develop a self-consistent scenario to explain the complex\nphenomenology of this object. Methods: We assume that the highest energy\nelectrons accelerated at the termination shock escape from the bow shock and\ndiffuse into the ambient medium, where they emit synchrotron X-rays. The linear\ngeometry should reflect the plane-parallel geometry of its ambient field.\nResults: We estimate the Lorentz factor of the X-ray emitting electrons and the\nstrength of the magnetic field. The former (~10^8) is close to its maximum\npossible value, while the latter, at ~45 uG, is higher than typical\ninterstellar values and must have been amplified in some way. The magnetic\nfield must also be turbulent to some degree to trap the electrons sufficiently\nfor synchrotron X-ray emission to occur effectively.

IGR J17098-3628 has been regularly detected by INTEGRAL and RXTE over\nthe entire period of the observational campaign; it was also observed with\npointed observations by XMM and Swift/XRT in 2005 and 2006 and exhibited flux\nvariations not linked with the change of any particular spectral features. IGR\nJ17091-3624 was initially in quiescence (after a period of activity between\n2003 April and 2004 April) and it was then detected again in outburst in the\nXRT field of view during a Swift observation of IGR J17098--3628 on 2007 July\n9. The observations during quiescence provide an upper limit to the 0.2-10 keV\nluminosity, while the observations in outburst cover the transition from the\nhard to the soft state. Moreover, we obtain a refined X-ray position for IGR\nJ17091-3624 from the Swift/XRT observations during the outburst in 2007. The\nnew position is inconsistent with the previously proposed radio counterpart. We\nidentify in VLA archive data a compact radio source consistent with the new\nX-ray position and propose it as the radio counterpart of the X-ray transient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2008 11:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We clarify that\nin order to have a cohomology theory, the coefficients of the twisted\nequivariant cohomology must be taken in the completed polynomial algebra over\nthe dual Lie algebra of $G$. We recall the relation between the equivariant\ncohomology of exact Courant algebroids and the twisted equivariant cohomology,\nand we show how to endow with a generalized complex structure the finite\ndimensional approximations of the Borel construction $M\\times_G EG_k$, whenever\nthe generalized complex manifold $M$ possesses a Hamiltonian $G$ action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2008 15:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-15"}
