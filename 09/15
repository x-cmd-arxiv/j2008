A key assumption of our BME approach is the\nzero-heat flux approximation, i.e. the neglection of third order velocity\nterms. We tested this assumption by performing test particle simulations for\nstars in a disk galaxy subject to a rotating spiral perturbation. As a result\nwe corroborated qualitatively the complex velocity structure found in the BME\napproach.

Our\nresults suggest that, for young starbursts with estimated tidal field strength\nand known recent star formation history, observed cluster-to-star mass ratios,\nonce corrected for the undetected clusters, constitute promising probes of the\nlocal SFE, without the need of resorting to gas mass estimates. Similarly, the\nmass ratio of stars which remain in bound clusters at the end of the infant\nmortality/weight-loss phase depends sensitively on the mean local SFE, although\nthe impacts of the width of the SFE distribution function and of the core\nmass-radius relation require more careful assessment in this case. Following\nthe recent finding by Bastian (2008) that galaxies form, on the average, 8% of\ntheir stars in bound clusters regardless of their star formation rate, we raise\nthe hypothesis that star formation in the present-day Universe is characterized\nby a near-universal distribution for the local SFE. A related potential\napplication of our model consists in tracing the evolution of the local SFE\nover cosmological lookback times by comparing the age distribution of the total\nmass in star clusters to that in field stars.

It can be applied within spaces of arbitrary\ndimensions and geometry. This recursive segmentation of space yields, for a\n$d$-dimensional space, a $d-1$ succession of $n$-dimensional subspaces that\nfully characterize the topology of the density field. The final 1D manifold of\nthe hierarchy is the fully connected network of the primary critical lines of\nthe field : the skeleton. It corresponds to the subset of lines linking maxima\nto saddle points, and provides a definition of the filaments that compose the\ncosmic web as a precise physical object, which makes it possible to compute any\nof its properties such as its length, curvature, connectivity etc... When the\nskeleton extraction is applied to initial conditions of cosmological N-body\nsimulations and their present day non linear counterparts, it is shown that the\ntime evolution of the cosmic web, as traced by the skeleton, is well accounted\nfor by the Zel'dovich approximation. Comparing this skeleton to the initial\nskeleton undergoing the Zel'dovich mapping shows that two effects are competing\nduring the formation of the cosmic web: a general dilation of the larger\nfilaments that is captured by a simple deformation of the skeleton of the\ninitial conditions on the one hand, and the shrinking, fusion and disappearance\nof the more numerous smaller filaments on the other hand.

At the classical level, the\nsupersymmetry breaking is parameterized in terms of a single (in general\ncomplex) mass parameter, $\\xi$, describing the stochasticity of the\nGrassmannian superspace coordinates. In the context of the standard model with\nstochastic supersymmetry, the structure of the soft breaking terms has various\ncharacteristic features that can be tested in LHC experiments. Namely, at the\nclassical level, the $B_{\\mu}$ parameter, the universal soft trilinear coupling\n$A_0$, the universal gaugino mass $m_{1/2}$ and the universal scalar mass $m_0$\nare given solely in terms of $\\xi$; there are no other arbitrary parameters.\nThe relations are $B_\\mu = \\xi^*$, $A_0 = 2\\xi^*$, $m_{1/2} = |\\xi|/2$ and $m_0\n= 0$. At the quantum level, these relations hold at a certain scale $\\Lambda$\nwhich is a second free parameter. The soft scalar masses, zero at tree-level,\nare induced radiatively through the renormalization group equations at\none-loop. With this pattern of soft breaking terms, large supersymmetric\ncontributions to FCNC processes are avoided. As a concrete illustration of the\nproposed formalism, we consider a minimal model, which is just the constrained\nMSSM with the stochastic superspace relations amongst the soft-breaking\nparameters imposed at the scale $\\Lambda$.

We show that the\ndifferences in the total intensity pulse morphology between the two classes are\nin general rather subtle. A much more significant difference is the fractional\npolarization which is very high for high Edot pulsars and low for low Edot\npulsars. The Edot at the transition is very similar to the death line predicted\nfor curvature radiation. This suggests a possible link between high energy and\nradio emission in pulsars and could imply that gamma-ray efficiency is\ncorrelated with the degree of linear polarization in the radio band. The degree\nof circular polarization is in general higher in the second component of\ndoubles, which is possibly caused by the effect of co-rotation on the curvature\nof the field lines in the inertial observer frame.\n  The most direct link between the high energy emission and the radio emission\ncould be the sub-group of pulsars which we call the energetic wide beam\npulsars. These young pulsars have very wide profiles with steep edges and are\nlikely to be emitted from a single magnetic pole. The similarities with the\nhigh energy profiles suggest that both types of emission are produced at the\nsame extended height range in the magnetosphere. Alternatively, the beams of\nthe energetic wide beam pulsars could be magnified by propagation effects in\nthe magnetosphere.

The X-ray observations of the\nflare taken from the RHESSI spacecraft reveal two phases of the flare\nevolution. The first phase is characterized by the altitude decrease of the\nX-ray looptop (LT) source for $\\sim$11 minutes. Such a long duration of the\ndescending LT source motion is reported for the first time. The EUV loops,\nlocated below the X-ray LT source, also undergo contraction with similar speed\n($\\sim$15 km s$^{-1}$) in this interval. During the second phase the two\ndistinct hard X-ray footpoints (FP) sources are observed which correlate well\nwith UV and H$\\alpha$ flare ribbons. The X-ray LT source now exhibits upward\nmotion. The RHESSI spectra during the first phase are soft and indicative of\nhot thermal emission from flaring loops with temperatures $T>25$ MK at the\nearly stage. On the other hand, the spectra at high energies ($\\varepsilon\n\\gtrsim$25 keV) follow hard power laws during the second phase ($\\gamma =\n2.6-2.8$). We show that the observed motion of the LT and FP sources can be\nunderstood as a consequence of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection at a\nseparator in the corona. During the first phase of the flare, the reconnection\nreleases an excess of magnetic energy related to the magnetic tensions\ngenerated before a flare by the shear flows in the photosphere. The relaxation\nof the associated magnetic shear in the corona by the reconnection process\nexplains the descending motion of the LT source. During the second phase, the\nordinary reconnection process dominates describing the energy release in terms\nof the standard model of large eruptive flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2008 10:52:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2009 11:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The backreaction of the cosmic ray\ncomponent on the thermal component is treated in the two-fluid approximation,\nand we include thermal particle injection and energy transfer due to the\nacoustic instability in the precursor. The transient state of our model that\ndescribes the current state of the shock at knot g, occurs during the evolution\nfrom a thermal gas dominated shock to a smooth cosmic-ray dominated shock.\nAssuming a distance of 2.3 kpc to Tycho's remnant we obtain values for the\ncosmic ray diffusion coefficient, the injection parameter, and the time scale\nfor the energy transfer of 10^{24} cm^{2} s^{-1}, 4.2x10^{-3}, and 426 y,\nrespectively.

This allows for the identification of the carriers of the different\nemission bands. Our fits also constrain the physical properties of different\ndust species and grain sizes responsible for the observed emission features.\nResults: In all stars the dust is oxygen-rich: amorphous and crystalline\nsilicate dust species prevail and no features of a carbon-rich component can be\nfound, the exception being EPLyr, where a mixed chemistry of both oxygen- and\ncarbon-rich species is found. Our full spectral fitting indicates a high degree\nof dust grain processing. The mineralogy of our sample stars shows that the\ndust is constituted of irregularly shaped and relatively large grains, with\ntypical grain sizes larger than 2 micron.

There is evidence for substantial X-ray absorption (logN_H>23 cm^{-2})\nin about 20% of the sources in the sample. The comoving space density of\nluminous (L_X >10^{44} erg s^-1) QSOs declines exponentially (by an e--folding\nper unit redshift) in the z=3.0-4.5 range, with a behavior similar to that\nobserved for optically bright unobscured QSOs selected in large area optical\nsurveys. Prospects for future, large and deep X-ray surveys are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2008 13:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

On the contrary, the AGN\nspectrum is of a type that has been associated with the presence of a\nradiativelyinefficient accretion flow that could be controlled by AGN heating\nand subsequent cooling of the hot, X-ray emitting gas. If correct, this means\nthat B2 0838+32A is the first source in which we can directly see\nentropy-increasing processes (shocks) driven by accretion from the hot phase of\nthe interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2008 14:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The local-search algorithm for $k$-median was analyzed\nby Arya et al. (SIAM J.

The degrees of CP $m_c$ for\nthe VLBI core region at 15 GHz are similar to values reported earlier at this\nwavelength, with typical values of a few tenths of a percent.We find that $m_c$\nas often rises as falls with increasing frequency between 15 and 22 GHz, while\n$m_c$ at 43 GHz is in all cases higher than at 22 and 15 GHz. This behaviour\nseems contrary to expectations, since the degree of CP from both synchrotron\nradiation and Faraday conversion of linear to circular polarization should {\\em\ndecrease} towards higher frequencies if the source is homogeneous. The increase\nin $m_c$ at 43 GHz may be due to the presence of regions of both positive and\nnegative CP with different frequency dependences on small scales within the\ncore region; alternatively, it may be associated with the intrinsic\ninhomogeneity of a Blandford-K\\\"onigl-like jet. In several objects, the\ndetected CO appears to be near, but not coincident with the core, although\nfurther observations are needed to confirm this. We find several cases of\nchanges in sign with frequency, most often between 22 and 43 GHz. We find\ntentative evidence for transverse structure in the CP of 1055+018 and\n1334$-$127 that is consistent with their being generated by either the\nsynchrotron mechanism or Faraday conversion in a helical magnetic field. Our\nresults confirm the earlier finding that the sign of the CP at a given\nobserving frequency is generally consistent across epochs separated by several\nyears or more, suggesting stability of the magnetic field orientation in the\ninnermost jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2008 15:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The signal can be\nrecovered, for instance, using a simple Wiener filter. However, in certain\ncases, additional information may also be available, such as a second\nobservation which correlates to a certain level with the sought signal. In\norder to improve the quality of the reconstruction, it would be useful to\ninclude as well this additional information. Under these circumstances, we have\nconstructed a linear filter, the linear covariance-based filter, that extracts\nthe signal from the data but takes also into account the correlation with the\nsecond observation. To illustrate the performance of the method, we present a\nsimple application to reconstruct the so-called Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect\nfrom simulated observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background and of\ncatalogues of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2008 15:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
