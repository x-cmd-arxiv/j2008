METHODS: We observe short\nradio pulses in a broad frequency band with the dipole-interferometer LOPES\n(LOFAR Prototype Station), which is triggered by a particle detector array\nnamed Karlsruhe Shower Core and Array Detector (KASCADE). LOFAR is the Low\nFrequency Array. For this analysis, 23 strong air shower events are selected\nusing parameters from KASCADE. RESULTS: The resulting electric field spectra\nfall off to higher frequencies. An average electric field spectrum is fitted\nwith an exponential, or alternatively, with a power law. The spectral slope\nobtained is not consistent within uncertainties and it is slightly steeper than\nthe slope obtained from Monte Carlo simulations based on air showers simulated\nwith CORSIKA (Cosmic Ray Simulations for KASCADE). One of the strongest events\nwas measured during thunderstorm activity in the vicinity of LOPES and shows\nthe longest pulse length measured of 110 ns and a spectral slope of -3.6.\nCONCLUSIONS: We show with two different methods that frequency spectra from air\nshower radio emission can be reconstructed on event-by-event basis, with only\ntwo dozen dipole antennae simultaneously over a broad range of frequencies.\nAccording to the obtained spectral slopes, the maximum power is emitted below\n40 MHz. Furthermore, the decrease in power to higher frequencies indicates a\nloss in coherence determined by the shower disc thickness.

Because the meteorite data seemed sound and no reasonable\nmodification to stellar theory resulted in good agreement for 95Mo, it has been\nsuggested that the recommended neutron capture reaction rate for this nuclide\nis 30% too low. Therefore, we have made a new determination of the\n95Mo(n,gamma) reaction rate via high-resolution measurements of the\nneutron-capture and total cross sections of 95Mo at the Oak Ridge Electron\nLinear Accelerator.

However, reports of deviations of reduced-neutron-width\ndistributions from the expected Porter-Thomas (PT) shape largely have been\nignored. Most of these deviations have been reported for odd-A nuclides.\nBecause reliable spin (J) assignments have been absent for most resonances for\nsuch nuclides, it is possible that reported deviations from PT might be due to\nincorrect J assignments. We recently developed a new method for measuring spins\nof neutron resonances by using the DANCE detector at LANSCE. Measurements made\nwith a 147Sm sample allowed us to determine spins of almost all known\nresonances below 1 keV. Furthermore, analysis of these data revealed that the\nreduced-neutron-width distribution was in good agreement with PT for resonances\nbelow 350 eV, but in disagreement with PT for resonances between 350 and 700\neV. Our previous (n,alpha) measurements had revealed that the alpha strength\nfunction also changes abruptly at this energy. There currently is no known\nexplanation for these two non-statistical effects. Recently, we have developed\nanother new method for determining the spins of neutron resonances. To\nimplement this technique required a small change (to record pulse-height\ninformation for coincidence events) to a much simpler apparatus: A pair of C6D6\ngamma-ray detectors which we have employed for many years to measure\nneutron-capture cross sections at ORELA. Measurements with a 95Mo sample\nrevealed that not only does the method work very well for determining spins,\nbut it also makes possible parity assignments. Taken together, these new\ntechniques at LANSCE and ORELA could be very useful for further elucidation of\nnon-statistical effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2008 17:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In our model, a\nprotocluster consists of a small virialised region surrounded by in-falling\nmatter.

The model\ndeparts from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged\nforces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW\nhas only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and\nstructure of liquid water, its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable\nor better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less\nthan 1% of the computational cost. We conclude that it is not the nature of the\ninteractions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the\nstructural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time\nprovided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in\ndeeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying\ntransitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of\nbiomolecules and complex materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2008 21:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-18"}

This study focuses primarily on spin\ninduced effects with emphasis on the maximally spinning limit and the\nidentification of possible causes of generic behavior.\n  We find that gravitational waves emitted during the plunging phase exhibit\ndamped oscillatory behavior, corresponding to a coherent excitation of\nquasi-normal modes by the test particle. This feature is universal in the sense\nthat the frequencies and damping time do not depend on the orbital parameters\nof the plunging particle. Furthermore, the observed frequencies are distinct\nfrom those associated with the usual free quasi-normal ringing.

The dependence of linear momentum emission on the angle\nat which a polar orbit impacts the horizon is quantified.

We find that hidden sector decays of a 1 TeV Z' can be observed at 5\nsigma significance with 50 fb^{-1} at the LHC. Observation of a 1.5 TeV state\nrequires super-LHC statistics of 1 ab^{-1}. Control of the systematic errors,\nin particular the parton distribution function uncertainty of the dominant Z\n\\gamma background, is crucial to maximize the LHC search\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2008 03:41:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

The analysis applies to all\nfrequencies, particularly including the near infrared and visible spectrum, and\nto a wide range of sizes, including nanometallic structures. We use the\napproach here specifically to analyze waveguide junctions. We show that the\nfull modal structure of the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguides--which\nconsists of real and complex discrete eigenvalue spectra, as well as the\ncontinuous spectrum--forms a complete basis set. We provide the derivation of\nthese modes using the techniques developed for Sturm-Liouville and generalized\neigenvalue equations. We demonstrate the need to include all parts of the\nspectrum to have a complete set of basis vectors to describe scattering within\nMIM waveguides with the mode-matching technique. We numerically compare the\nmode-matching formulation with finite-difference frequency-domain analysis and\nfind very good agreement between the two for modal scattering at symmetric MIM\nwaveguide junctions. We touch upon the similarities between the underlying\nmathematical structure of the MIM waveguide and the PT symmetric quantum\nmechanical pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The rich set of modes that the MIM\nwaveguide supports forms a canonical example against which other more\ncomplicated geometries can be compared. Our work here encompasses the microwave\nresults, but extends also to waveguides with real metals even at infrared and\noptical frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2008 03:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2008 22:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-17"}

We find that the fraction of\nplanetesimals found in mean motion resonances is reduced and planetary\nmigration rates are on average about 50% slower when gravitational interactions\nbetween the planetesimals are computed than when planetesimal self-gravity is\nneglected. This is likely due to gravitational stirring of the planetesimal\ndisk that is not present when self-gravity is neglected that reduces their\ncapture efficiency because of the increased particle eccentricity dispersion.\nWe find that migration is more stochastic when the disk is self-gravitating or\ncomprised of more massive bodies.

In each\ncase, proteins are modeled either as spherical particles, as dipolar spheres or\nas collection of several small beads with one dipole. Spherical reaction\npatches are placed on the model proteins according to the known experimental\nstructures of the protein complexes. In the computer simulations, concentration\nis varied by changing box size. Encounter is defined as overlap of the reaction\npatches and the corresponding first passage times are recorded together with\nthe number of unsuccessful contacts before encounter. We find that encounter\nfrequency scales linearly with protein concentration, thus proving that our\nmicroscopic model results in a well-defined macroscopic encounter rate. The\nnumber of unsuccessful contacts before encounter decreases with increasing\nencounter rate and ranges from 20-9000. For all three models, encounter rates\nare obtained within one order of magnitude of the experimentally measured\nassociation rates. Electrostatic steering enhances association up to 50-fold.\nIf diffusional encounter is dominant (p53:MDM2) or similarly important as\nelectrostatic steering (barnase:barstar), then encounter rate decreases with\ndecreasing patch radius. More detailed modeling of protein shapes decreases\nencounter rates by 5-95 percent. Our study shows how generic principles of\nprotein-protein association are modulated by molecular features of the systems\nunder consideration. Moreover it allows us to assess different coarse-graining\nstrategies for the future modelling of the dynamics of large protein complexes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2008 08:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

But the SCZ is also in a state of differential rotation,\nand its dynamical stability properties are those of a weakly magnetized gas.\nThis renders it far more prone to rapidly growing rotational baroclinic\ninstabilities than a hydrodynamical system would be. These instabilities should\nbe treated on the same footing as convective instabilites. If isentropic and\nisorotational surfaces coincide in the SCZ, the gas is marginally (un)stable to\n{\\em both} convective and rotational disturbances. This is a plausible\nresolution for the instabilities associated with these more general rotating\nconvective systems. This motivates an analysis of the thermal wind equation in\nwhich isentropes and isorotational surfaces are identical. The characteristics\nof this partial differential equation correspond to isorotation contours, and\ntheir form may be deduced even without precise knowledge of how the entropy and\nrotation are functionally related. Although the exact solution of the global\nSCZ problem in principle requires this knowledge, even the simplest models\nproduce striking results in broad agreement with helioseismology data. This\nincludes horizontal (i.e. quasi-spherical) isorotational contours at the poles,\naxial contours at the equator, and approximately radial contours at\nmidlatitudes. The theory does not apply directly to the tachocline, where a\nsimple thermal wind balance is not expected to be valid.

The terms of such series are often called modes. A master- (or\ndetermining) mode set is a subset of these modes, the time history of which\nuniquely determines the time history of the entire turbulent flow provided that\nthis flow is developed. In the present work the existence of the\nmaster-mode-set is demonstrated numerically for turbulent channel flow. The\nminimal size of a master-mode set and the rate of the process of the recovery\nof the entire flow from the master-mode set history are estimated. The velocity\nfield corresponding to the minimal master-mode set is found to be a good\napproximation for mean velocity in the entire flow field. Mean characteristics\ninvolving velocity derivatives deviate in a very close vicinity to the wall,\nwhile master-mode two-point correlations exhibit unrealistic oscillations. This\ncan be improved by using a larger than minimal master-mode set. The near-wall\nstreaks are found to be contained in the velocity field corresponding to the\nminimal master-mode set, and the same is true at least for the large-scale part\nof the longitudinal vorticity structure. A database containing the time history\nof a master-mode set is demonstrated to be an efficient tool for investigating\nrare events in turbulent flows. In particular, a travelling-wave-like object\nwas identified on the basis of the analysis of the database.

However, accurate surface chemistry models are\ncomputationally expensive and are difficult to integrate with gas-phase\nsimulations. A new modified-rate method for solving grain-surface chemical\nsystems is presented. Its purpose is accurately to model highly complex systems\nthat can otherwise only be treated using the sometimes inadequate rate-equation\napproach. In contrast to previous rate-modification techniques, the functional\nform of the surface production rates was modified, and not simply the rate\ncoefficient. This form is appropriate to the extreme \"small-grain\" limit, and\ncan be verified using an analytical master-equation approach. Various further\nmodifications were made to this basic form, to account for competition between\nprocesses, to improve estimates of surface occupation probabilities, and to\nallow a switch-over to the normal rate equations where these are applicable.\nThe new method was tested against systems solved previously using exact\ntechniques. Even the simplest method is quite accurate, and a great improvement\nover rate equations. Further modifications allow the master-equation results to\nbe reproduced exactly for the methanol-producing system, within computational\naccuracy. Small discrepancies arise when non-zero activation energies are\nassumed for the methanol system, which result from complex reaction-competition\nprocesses that cannot be resolved easily without using exact methods.\nInaccuracies in computed abundances are never greater than a few tens of\npercent, and typically of the order of one percent, in the most complex systems\ntested. Implementation of the method in simple networks, including\nhydrogen-only systems, is trivial, whilst the results are highly accurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2008 14:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

So far the search has provided 25 candidates with\nmetallicities around or smaller -3. For 15 candidates high resolution\nspectroscopy with UVES at the VLT has confirmed their extremely metal-poor\nstatus. Work is under way to extend the search to the SDSS's photometric\ncatalog by augmenting the SDSS photometry, and by gauging the capabilities of\nX-shooter when going to significantly fainter targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2008 15:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
