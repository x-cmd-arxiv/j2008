The decoherence and the relaxation of the system caused by the gate\nvoltage noise and electron-phonon scattering are investigated. In order to take\naccount of the strong correlation of the electrons in this system, the\nquasi-exact wave functions are calculated using an improved matrix product\nstates algorithm. This algorithm enables us to calculate the wave functions of\nthe ground state and the low lying excited states with satisfied accuracy and\nthus enables us to study the kinetics of the system more effectively. It is\nfound that although both of these two mechanisms are proportional to the\nelectron number operator in the dot, the kinetics are quite different. The\nnoise induced decoherence is much more effective than the energy relaxation,\nwhile the energy relaxation and decoherence time are of the same order for the\nelectron-phonon scattering. Moreover, the noise induced decoherence increases\nwith the lowering of the dot level, but the relaxation and decoherence due to\nthe electron-phonon scattering decrease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Sep 2008 00:17:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 13:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In addition, their spin down rates\nduring outburst show opposite trends, which so far has no explanation. Here, we\nextend our quark-nova model for AXPs to include transient AXPs, in which the\noutbursts are caused by transient accretion events from a Keplerian (iron-rich)\ndegenerate ring. For a ring with inner and outer radii of 23.5 km and 26.5 km,\nrespectively, our model gives a good fit to the observed X-ray outburst from\nXTE J1810-197 and the behavior of temperature, luminosity, and area of the two\nX-ray blackbodies with time. The two blackbodies in our model are related to a\nheat front (i.e. Bohm diffusion front) propagating along the ring's surface and\nan accretion hot spot on the quark star surface. Radio pulsations in our model\nare caused by dissipation at the light cylinder of magnetic bubbles, produced\nnear the ring during the X-ray outburst. The delay between X-ray peak emission\nand radio emission in our model is related to the propagation time of these\nbubbles to the light cylinder.

The\nso-called clopen subobjects of the spectral presheaf play the role of\nmeasurable sets.

The method is based on the division of the\nfull function space into two segments, internal (localized) and external\n(infinitely extended). The spectroscopic information on the resonances is\nobtained from the non-Hermitian effective Hamilton operator $H_{\\rm eff}$\nappearing in the internal part due to the coupling to the external part. As\nwell known, additional so-called cut-off poles of the $S$-matrix appear,\ngenerally, due to the truncation of the potential. We study the question of\nspurious $S$ matrix poles in the framework of the Feshbach formalism. The\nnumerical analysis is performed for exactly solvable potentials with a finite\nnumber of resonance states. These potentials represent a generalization of\nBargmann-type potentials to accept resonance states. Our calculations\ndemonstrate that the poles of the $S$ matrix obtained by using the Feshbach\nprojection-operator formalism coincide with both the complex energies of the\nphysical resonances and the cut-off poles of the $S$-matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Sep 2008 14:04:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2008 17:02:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 18:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This\nproperty is also present in some non-crackling systems. Here, the uncommon\ncharacter of the scaling law is illustrated with simple marked renewal\nprocesses, built by definition with no correlations. Whereas processes with a\nfinite mean waiting time do not fulfill a scaling law in general and tend\ntowards a Poisson process in the limit of very high sizes, processes without a\nfinite mean tend to another class of distributions, characterized by double\npower-law waiting-time densities. This is somehow reminiscent of the\ngeneralized central limit theorem. A model with short-range correlations is not\nable to escape from the attraction of those limit distributions. A discussion\non open problems in the modeling of these properties is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Sep 2008 15:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
