In such case, their contribution to light neutrino masses has the\nsuppression of a small lepton number violating parameter, so that light\nneutrino masses can arise naturally even if the seesaw scale is low and the\nheavy neutrino mixing is large. We implement the same mechanism with fermionic\ntriplets in type III seesaw, deriving the interactions of the new quasi-Dirac\nneutrinos and heavy charged leptons with the SM fermions. We then study the\nobservability of heavy Dirac neutrino singlets (seesaw I) and triplets (seesaw\nIII) at LHC. Contrarily to common wisdom, we find that heavy Dirac neutrino\nsinglets with a mass around 100 GeV are observable at the 5 sigma level with a\nluminosity of 13 fb^-1. Indeed, in the final state with three charged leptons\nl+- l+- l-+, not previously considered, Dirac neutrino signals can be\nrelatively large and backgrounds are small. In the triplet case, heavy\nneutrinos can be discovered with a luminosity of 1.5 fb^-1 for a mass of 300\nGeV in the same channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2008 18:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Sep 2008 08:52:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 11:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-12"}

That is, the electronic wavefunction is calculated in\nthe presence of the mean field of the environment. In this paper a direct\nquantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) analog of such a mean-field\ntheory is formulated based on variational and perturbative frameworks. In the\nvariational framework, an appropriate QM/MM free energy functional is defined\nand is minimized in terms of the trial wavefunction that best approximates the\ntrue QM wavefunction in a statistically averaged sense. Analytical free energy\ngradient is obtained, which takes the form of the gradient of effective QM\nenergy calculated in the averaged MM potential. In the perturbative framework,\nthe above variational procedure is shown to be equivalent with the first-order\nexpansion of the QM energy (in the exact free energy expression) about the\nself-consistent reference field. This helps understand the relation between the\nvariational procedure and the exact QM/MM free energy as well as existing QM/MM\ntheories. Based on this, several ways are discussed for evaluating\nnon-mean-field effects (i.e., statistical fluctuations of the QM wavefunction)\nthat are neglected in the mean-field calculation. As an illustration, the\nmethod is applied to an SN2 Menshutkin reaction in water, NH3 + CH3CL ->\nNH3CH3^{+} + CL^{-}, for which free energy profiles are obtained at the HF,\nMP2, B3LYP, and BH&HLYP levels by integrating the free energy gradient.\nNon-mean-field effects are evaluated to be < 0.5 kcal/mol using a Gaussian\nfluctuation model for the environment, which suggests that those effects are\nrather small for the present reaction in water.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Sep 2008 10:54:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2008 23:07:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2008 13:33:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2008 09:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The essential ingredients of this model, in\nthe unperturbed regime, are a stationary shock and a subsonic region of\ndeceleration. For the sake of analytical simplicity, the 2D unperturbed flow is\nparallel and the deceleration is produced adiabatically by an external\npotential. The instability mechanism is determined unambiguously as the\nconsequence of a cycle between advected and acoustic perturbations. The purely\nacoustic cycle, considered alone, is proven to be stable in this flow. Its\ncontribution to the instability can be either constructive or destructive. A\nfrequency cut-off is associated to the advection time through the region of\ndeceleration. This cut-off frequency explains why the instability favours\neigenmodes with a low frequency and a large horizontal wavelength. The relation\nbetween the instability occurring in this highly simplified toy model and the\nproperties of SASI observed in the numerical simulations of stellar\ncore-collapse is discussed. This simple set up is proposed as a benchmark test\nto evaluate the accuracy, in the linear regime, of numerical simulations\ninvolving this instability.

An ad-hoc network is characterized by energy constrained nodes,\nbandwidth constrained links and dynamic topology. With the growing use of\nwireless networks (including ad-hoc networks) for real-time applications, such\nas voice, video, and real-time data, the need for Quality of Service (QoS)\nguarantees in terms of delay, bandwidth, and packet loss is becoming\nincreasingly important. Providing QoS in ad-hoc networks is a challenging task\nbecause of dynamic nature of network topology and imprecise state information.\nHence, it is important to have a dynamic routing protocol with fast re-routing\ncapability, which also provides stable route during the life-time of the flows.\n  In this thesis, we have proposed a novel, energy aware, stable routing\nprotocol named, Stability-based QoS-capable Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector\n(SQ-AODV), which is an enhancement of the well-known Ad-hoc On-demand Distance\nVector (AODV) routing protocol for ad-hoc wireless networks. SQ-AODV utilizes a\ncross-layer design approach in which information about the residual energy of a\nnode is used for route selection and maintenance. An important feature of\nSQ-AODV protocol is that it uses only local information and requires no\nadditional communication or co-operation between the network nodes. SQ-AODV\npossesses a make-before-break re-routing capability that enables near-zero\npacket drops and is compatible with the basic AODV data formats and operation,\nmaking it easy to adopt in ad-hoc networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Sep 2008 08:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-16"}

This has crucial consequences for gravity physics and cosmology,\nsuch as negative energy density for static gravity field and violation of\nenergy conservation in expanding space. However there is alternative Field\nGravity approach for description of gravitation as a symmetric tensor field in\nMinkowski space, which is similar to description of all other physical\ninteractions and based on well-defined positive, localizable energy-momentum of\nthe gravity field. This relativistic quantum Field Gravity approach was\npartially developed by Firz & Pauli (1939), Birkhoff (1944), Thirring (1961),\nKalman (1961), Feynman (1963) and others.

The 99%\nconfidence level flux upper limit (>1 TeV) for the prompt phase (9s) of GRB\n060602B is 2.9x10^-9 erg cm^-2 s^-1.

On the other hand\nit is widely known that in general eigenstates of the interaction are not\npointer states. Therefore the procedure of selecting pointer states by purity\nmaximization (known as \"purity sieve\") should not rely on short-time purity\nbehavior.
