The angular extent\nof the region of perturbation due to the planet is significantly smaller than\nthe angular size of the source, and as a result the planetary signature is also\nsmoothed out by the finite source size. Thus the deviation from a single-lens\nfit is broad and relatively weak (~ few percent). Nevertheless, we demonstrate\nthat the planetary nature of the deviation can be unambiguously ascertained\nfrom the gross features of the residuals, and detailed analysis yields a fairly\nprecise planet/star mass ratio of q = 0.0026+/-0.0004, in accord with the large\nsignificance (\\Delta\\chi^2=1070) of the detection.

As expected, satellites have\nsystematically higher assembly redshifts than central galaxies of the same\nbaryonic mass, and satellites in more massive halos form earlier. However,\ncontrary to the simplest expectations, satellite galaxies continue to accrete\ngas and convert it to stars; the gas accretion declines steadily over a period\nof 0.5-1 Gyr after the satellite halo merges with a larger parent halo.\nSatellites in a cluster mass halo eventually begin to lose baryonic mass.

In effect, satellite galaxies can remain \"central\"\nobjects of halo substructures, with continuing accretion and mergers, making\nthe transition in assembly histories and physical properties a gradual one.\nImplementing such a gradual transformation in semi-analytic models would\nimprove their agreement with the observed colour distributions of satellite\ngalaxies in groups and with the observed colour dependence of galaxy\nclustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2008 19:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

Interaction effects between a\ngeneral molecular system and a spatially anisotropic metal particle supporting\nplasmon excitations in the presence of an external radiation field are\nsystematically included through many-body perturbation theory. Reduction of the\nexact effects of molecular-electronic correlation to the level of Hartree-Fock\nmean-field theory is made for practical initial implementation, while\ndescription of collective oscillations of conduction electrons in the metal is\nreduced to that of a classical plasma density; extension of the former to a\nKohn-Sham density-functional or second-order M{\\o}ller-Plesset perturbation\ntheory is discussed; further specialization of the latter to the random-phase\napproximation allows for several salient features of the formalism to be\nhighlighted without need for numerical computation. Scattering and\nlinear-response properties of the coupled system subjected to an external\nperturbing electric field in the electric-dipole interaction approximation are\ninvestigated. Both damping and finite-lifetime effects of molecular-electronic\nexcitations as well as the characteristic fourth-power enhancement of the\nmolecular Raman scattering intensity are elucidated from first principles.

In the proposed theory, we\ndiscuss the origin of two dynamic crossovers in a liquid: 1) the crossover from\nexponential to non-exponential and from Arrhenius to VFT relaxation at high\ntemperature and 2) the crossover from the VFT to a more Arrhenius-like\nrelaxation at low temperature. The corresponding values of $\\tau$ at the two\ncrossovers are in quantitative parameter-free agreement with experiments. The\norigin of the second crossover allows us to reconcile the ongoing controversy\nsurrounding the possible divergence of $\\tau$. The crossover to Arrhenius\nrelaxation universally takes place when $d_{\\rm el}$ reaches system size, thus\navoiding divergence and associated theoretical complications such as\nidentifying the nature of the phase transition and the second phase itself.\nFinally, we discuss the effect of volume on $\\tau$ and the origin of liquid\nfragility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2008 18:28:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 18:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2009 17:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The qubits\nare modeled as interacting spin-$\\half$ particles in a magnetic field and the\nenvironment is limited to inducing single spin-flip events.

With\nthe SEST, we detected the CO(2-1) rotational line from RX Lep.

The HI line at 21 cm was detected with\nthe Nancay Radiotelescope on the star position and at several offset positions.\nThe linear shell size is relatively small, ~0.1 pc, but we detect a trail\nextending southward to ~0.5 pc. The line profiles are approximately Gaussian\nwith an FWHM ~3.8 km/s and interpreted with a model developed for the detached\nshell around the carbon-rich AGB star Y CVn. Our HI spectra are well-reproduced\nby assuming a constant outflow (Mloss = 1.65 10^-7 Msun/yr) of ~4 10^4 years\nduration, which has been slowed down by the external medium. The spatial offset\nof the HI source is consistent with the northward direction of the proper\nmotion, lending support to the presence of a trail resulting from the motion of\nthe source through the ISM, as already suggested for Mira, RS Cnc, and other\nsources detected in HI. The source was also observed in SiO (3 mm) and OH (18\ncm), but not detected. The properties of the external parts of circumstellar\nshells around AGB stars should be dominated by the interaction between stellar\noutflows and external matter for oxygen-rich, as well as for carbon-rich,\nsources, and the 21-cm HI line provides a very useful tracer of these regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2008 22:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

At the fluctuation induced first\norder phase transition expected for the smectic to isotropic transition, a jump\nin the macroscopic conductivity is predicted, with a directional dependence\nthat reflects the fluctuation spectrum of the order parameter. When elastic\nfluctuation modes melt the smectic phase into a nematic phase, the resultant\nnematic order parameter is shown to be linearly proportional to the\nconductivity anisotropy. We also outline qualitative comparisons with recent\nexperimental works on strongly correlated materials that show evidences of\nelectronic liquid-crystalline mesophases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2008 22:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Many classes\nof stars show evidence for winds, disks, inflows and outflows with many\nphenomena occurring simultaneously.

Even for the nearest stars, this\nregion will not be imaged even after the completion of the next generation of\ntelescopes. Other methods for measuring the physical properties of\ncircumstellar material must be developed. The polarization of light across\nspectral lines is a signature that contains information about the circumstellar\nmaterial on these small spatial scales.

In the past, several\nattempts have been made assuming that the particle electric charge is localized\npoint-wise (point-charge). These involve the search of possible so-called\n\"regularization\" approaches able to deal with the intrinsic divergences\ncharacterizing point-particle descriptions in classical electrodynamics. In\nthis paper we intend to propose a new solution to this problem based on the\nadoption of a variational approach and the treatment of finite-size\nspherical-shell charges. The approach is based on three key elements: 1) the\nadoption of the relativistic synchronous Hamilton variational principle\nrecently pointed out (Tessarotto et al, 2006); 2) the variational treatment of\nthe EM self-field, for finite-size charges, taking into account the exact\nparticle dynamics; 3) the adoption of the axioms of classical mechanics and\nelectrodynamics. The new RR equation proposed in this paper, departing\nsignificantly from previous approaches, exhibits several interesting\nproperties. In particular: a) unlike the LAD (Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac) equation,\nit recovers a second-order ordinary differential equation which is fully\nconsistent with the law of inertia, Newton principle of determinacy and\nEinstein causality principle and b) unlike the LL (Landau-Lifschitz) equation,\nit holds also in the case of sudden forces. In addition, it is found that the\nnew equation recovers the customary LAD equation in a suitable asymptotic\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2008 07:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-22"}

Our treatment makes use of\nthe Fraunhofer model of matter wave scattering and its recent extension to\ncollisions in electric [M. Lemeshko and B. Friedrich, J. Chem. Phys.\n\\textbf{129}, 024301 (2008)] and radiative fields [M. Lemeshko and B.\nFriedrich, Int. J. Mass. Spec. in press (2008)]. A magnetic field aligns the\nmolecule in the space-fixed frame and thereby alters the effective shape of the\ndiffraction target. This significantly affects the differential and integral\nscattering cross sections. We exemplify our treatment by evaluating the\nmagnetic-field-dependent scattering characteristics of the He -- CaH ($X\n^2\\Sigma^+$), He -- O$_2$ ($X ^3\\Sigma^-$) and He -- OH ($X ^2\\Pi_{\\Omega}$)\nsystems at thermal collision energies. Since the cross sections can be obtained\nfor different orientations of the magnetic field with respect to the relative\nvelocity vector, the model also offers predictions about the\nfrontal-versus-lateral steric asymmetry of the collisions. The steric asymmetry\nis found to be almost negligible for the He -- OH system, weak for the He --\nCaH collisions, and strong for the He -- O$_2$. While odd $\\Delta M$\ntransitions dominate the He -- OH $(J=3/2,f \\to J', e/f)$ integral cross\nsections in a magnetic field parallel to the relative velocity vector, even\n$\\Delta M$ transitions prevail in the case of the He -- CaH ($X ^2\\Sigma^+$)\nand He -- O$_2$ ($X ^3\\Sigma^-$) collision systems. For the latter system, the\nmagnetic field opens inelastic channels that are closed in the absence of the\nfield. These involve the transitions $N=1, J=0 \\to N', J' $ with $J'=N'$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2008 09:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-02"}

VSOP2 is a huge observation system involving ASTRO-G, ground radio\ntelescopes, tracking stations, and correlators, one institute can not prepare a\nwhole system of VSOP2. Then we must need close international collaboration to\nget sufficient quality of resultant maps and to give a sufficient quantity of\nobservation time for astronomical community. We formed a new international\ncouncil to provide guidance on scientific aspects related of VSOP2, currently\ncalled the VSOP2 International Science Council (VISC2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2008 10:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We look\nin detail at the problem of quasar classification, because identification of a\npure quasar sample is necessary to define the Gaia astrometric reference frame.\nBy varying a posterior probability threshold in DSC we can trade off sample\ncompleteness and contamination. We show, using our simulated data, that it is\npossible to achieve a pure sample of quasars (upper limit on contamination of 1\nin 40,000) with a completeness of 65% at magnitudes of G=18.5, and 50% at\nG=20.0, even when quasars have a frequency of only 1 in every 2000 objects. The\nstar sample completeness is simultaneously 99% with a contamination of 0.7%.\nIncluding parallax and proper motion in the classifier barely changes the\nresults. We further show that not accounting for class priors in the target\npopulation leads to serious misclassifications and poor predictions for sample\ncompleteness and contamination.

Magneto optical images show that the highest Jc\nvalues are observed within single grains oriented with their c axes\nperpendicular to the observation plane, implying that the intragranular current\nis anisotropic. The much lower intergranular Jc is at least partially due to\nmany extrinsic factors, because cracks and a ubiquitous wetting As-Fe phase are\nfound at many grain boundaries. However, some grain boundaries are structurally\nclean under high resolution transmission electron microscopy examination.\nBecause the whole-sample global Jc(5K) values of the two samples examined are\n1000-4000 A/cm2, some 10-40 times that found in random, polycrystalline\nYBa2Cu3O7-x, it appears that the dominant obstruction to intergranular current\nflow of many present samples is extrinsic, though some intrinsic limitation of\ncurrent flow across grain boundaries cannot yet be ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2008 14:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The notion of smooth Euclidean field\nthat is introduced here is the smooth, finite dimensional analogue of the\nfamiliar notion of continuous Hilbert field.

The logic states\nare defined by the position of two trapped flux quanta (vortices) in a 2x2\nblind-hole-matrix etched on a mesoscopic superconducting square. Such small\ncomputational unit-cells are well within reach of current fabrication\ntechnology. In an array of unit-cells, the vortex configuration of one cell\ninfluences the penetrating flux lines in the neighboring cell through the\nscreening currents. Alternatively, in conjoined cells, the information transfer\ncan be strengthened by the interactions between the supercurrents in adjacent\ncells. Here we present the functioning logic gates based on this fluxonic\ncellular automata (FCA), where the logic operations are verified through\ntheoretical simulations performed in the framework of the time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau theory. The input signals are defined by current loops placed\non top of the two diagonal blind holes of the input cell. For given\ncurrent-polarization, external flux lines are attracted or repelled by the\nloops, forming the '0' or '1' configuration. The read-out technology may be\nchosen from a large variety of modern vortex imaging methods, transport and\nLDOS measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2008 15:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

By applying these observations to a previously\nestablished analytical model of clumpy accretion disks, we suggest an\nevolutionary sequence for starburst and AGN phases. Whereas the observed\nproperties of the gas tell us about the current state of the torus, the\nstarburst characteristics provide information on the history of the torus. In\nthe suggested evolution, a torus passes through 3 different phases\npredetermined by an external mass accretion rate. Started by an initial, short,\nand massive gas infall, a turbulent and stellar wind-driven Q~1 disk is formed\nin which the starburst proceeds. Once the supernovae explode the intercloud\nmedium is removed, leaving a massive, geometrically thick, collisional disk\nwith a decreasing, but still high-mass accretion rate. When the mass accretion\nrate has significantly decreased, the collisional torus becomes thin and\ntransparent as the circumnuclear disk in the Galactic center of the Milky Way.\nVariations on this scenario are possible either when there is a second short\nand massive gas infall, in which case the torus may switch back into the\nstarburst mode, or when there is no initial short massive gas infall. All\nobserved tori up to now have been collisional and thick. The observations show\nthat this phase can last more than 100Myr. During this phase the decrease in\nthe mass accretion rate within the torus is slow (a factor of 4 within 150Myr).\nThe collisional tori also form stars, but with an efficiency of about 10% when\ncompared to a turbulent disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2008 15:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
