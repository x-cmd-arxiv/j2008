Simple as they\nare, the two mechanisms and the burst environment generate the rich structure\nof the light curves at all frequencies and times. This is demonstrated for 33\nselected Swift LGRBs and XRFs, which are well sampled from early until late\ntime and faithfully represent the entire diversity of the broad-band light\ncurves of Swift LGRBs and XRFs. Their prompt gamma-ray and X-ray emission is\ndominated by ICS of `glory' light. During their fast decline phase, ICS is\ntaken over by SR, which dominates their broad-band afterglow. The pulse shape\nand spectral evolution of the gamma-ray peaks and the early-time X-ray flares,\nand even the delayed optical `humps' in XRFs, are correctly predicted. The\n`canonical' and non-canonical X-ray light curves and the chromatic behaviour of\nthe broad-band afterglows are well reproduced. In particular, in canonical\nX-ray light curves, the initial fast decline and rapid softening of the prompt\nemission, the transition to the plateau phase, the subsequent gradual\nsteepening of the plateau to an asymptotic power-law decay, and the transition\nfrom chromatic to achromatic behaviour of the light curves agrees well with\nthose predicted by the CB model.

The resonance is switched on by tuning the chemical potential at an\nelectronic topological transition (ETT) near a band edge, where the Fermi\nsurface topology of one of the subbands changes from 1D to 2D topology. We show\nthat the tuning is realized by changing i) the misfit strain between the\nsuperconducting planes and the spacers ii) the charge density and iii) the\ndisorder. The system is at the verge of a catastrophe i.e. near a structural\nand magnetic phase transition associated with the stripes (analogous to the 1/8\nstripe phase in cuprates) order to disorder phase transition. Fine tuning of\nboth the chemical potential and the disorder pushes the critical temperature Ts\nof this phase transition to zero giving a quantum critical point. Here the\nquantum lattice and magnetic fluctuations promote the Feshbach resonance of the\nexchange-like anisotropic pairing. This superconducting phase that resists to\nthe attacks of temperature is shown to be controlled by the interplay of the\nhopping energy between stripes and the quantum fluctuations. The\nsuperconducting gaps in the multiple Fermi surface spots reported by the recent\nARPES experiment of D. V. Evtushinsky et al. arXiv:0809.4455 are shown to\nsupport the Feshbach scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2008 05:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-27"}

In this paper, we investigate this\ndependence in the residue contact networks of proteins in native structures,\nand show that the networks are not SWN but FN. FN is generally characterized by\nseveral dimensions. Among them, we focus on three dimensions; the network\ntopological dimension $D_c$, the fractal dimension $D_f$, and the spectral\ndimension $D_s$.

Hence\nthe residue contact networks in the protein native structures belong to the\nuniversality class of three dimensional percolation cluster.

The system represents a non-equilibrium\nquantum system which, driven through the oscillatory motion, is prevented from\nreaching its (separable) thermal equilibrium state. Environmental noise,\ntogether with the driven motion, plays a constructive role by periodically\nresetting the system, even though it will destroy entanglement as usual. As a\nbuilding block, the present simple mechanism supports the perspective that\nentanglement can exist also in systems which are exposed to a hot environment\nand to high levels of de-coherence, which we expect e.g. for biological\nsystems. Our results furthermore suggest that entanglement plays a role in the\nheat exchange between molecular machines and environment.

Luminous CO J=3--2\nemission and high CO (3--2)/(1--0) intensity ratios are found in all objects,\nindicating highly excited molecular gas. In 3C 293 an exceptionally bright CO\nJ=4--3 line is found which cannot be easily explained given its quiescent\nstar-forming environment and low AGN X-ray luminosity. In this object shocks\nemanating from a well-known interaction of a powerful jet with a dense ISM may\nbe responsible for the high excitation of its molecular gas on galaxy-wide\nscales. Star formation can readily account for the gas excitation in the rest\nof the objects, although high X-ray AGN luminosities can also contribute\nsignificantly in two cases. Measuring and eventually imaging CO line ratios in\nlocal luminous QSO hosts can be done by a partially completed ALMA during its\nearly phases of commissioning, promising a sensitive probe of starburst versus\nAGN activity in obscured environments at high linear resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2008 13:50:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2008 15:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This then\nimplies that the inhomogeneous system restores lattice periodicity at zero\nfrequency, has a well-defined Fermi surface, and should display perfect\n(ballistic) conductivity or \"transparency\". These results are, however, fragile\nwith respect to finite frequency, V, T, disorder, or magnetism, all of which\nrestore the expected quantum tunneling regime through a finite-width Mott\ninsulator. Our formal results are complemented by numerical renormalization\ngroup studies on small thickness barriers that illustrate under what\ncircumstances this behavior might be seen in real experimental systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2008 15:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-15"}

The effective action\ncontains a leading single-derivative term, similar to the Shraiman-Siggia term\nin the square lattice case, which gives rise to spirals in the staggered\nmagnetization. Depending on the values of the low-energy parameters, either a\nhomogeneous phase with four or a spiral phase with two filled hole pockets is\nenergetically favored.
