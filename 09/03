We constructed a radiative transfer code coupled with a code\ndetermining the disc's hydrostatic vertical structure. We have obtained for the\nfirst time model spectra of cold, convective accretion discs. As expected,\nthese spectra are mostly flat in the optical wavelengths with no contribution\nfrom the UV, which in quiescence must be emitted by the white dwarf. The disc\nstructures obtained with our radiative-transfer code compare well with the\nsolutions of equations used to describe the dwarf-nova outburst cycle according\nto the thermal-viscous disc instability model thus allowing the two to be\ncombined. Our code allows calculating the spectral evolution of dwarf nova\nstars through their whole outburst cycle, providing a new tool for testing\nmodels of accretion discs in cataclysmic variables.

We apply multiscale techniques -wavelet\ndenoising (WD)- to an extensive compendium of more than 24000 stars in the\nsolar neighbourhood with the best available astrometric, photometric and\nspectroscopic data. Results. We confirm that the dominant structures in the U-V\nplane are the branches of Sirius, Coma Berenices, Hyades-Pleiades and Hercules,\nwhich are nearly equidistant in this kinematic plane and show a negative slope.\nThe abrupt drops in the velocity distribution are characterized. We find a\ncertain dependence of these kinematic structures on Galactic position with a\nsignificant change of contrast among substructures inside the branches. A large\nspread of ages is observed for all branches. The Hercules branch is detected in\nall subsamples with ages older than ~ 2 Gyr and the set of the other three\nbranches is well established for stars > 400 Myr. The age-metallicity relation\nof each branch is examined and the relation between kinematics and metallicity\nis studied. Conclusions. Not all of these observational constraints are\nsuccessfully explained by the recent models proposed for the formation of such\nkinematic structures. Simulations incorporating stellar ages and metallicities\nare essential for future studies. The comparison of the observed and simulated\ndistributions obtained by WD will provide a physical interpretation of the\nexistence of the branches in terms of local or large-scale dynamics.

The influence of players is gauged\nfrom the viewpoint of basic player types, desirability relations and classical\npower indices such as Shapley-Shubik index, Banzhaf index, Holler index,\nDeegan-Packel index and Chow parameters.

In contrast to earlier studies, the\nsystem evolves under a so-called soft Glauber dynamic [P.A. Rikvold and M.\nKolesik, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35, L117 (2002)], for which both nucleation and\ninterface propagation are slower and the interfaces smoother than for the\nstandard Glauber dynamic. We choose the temperature and magnitude of the\nexternal field such that the metastable decay of the system following field\nreversal occurs through nucleation and growth of many droplets of the stable\nphase, i.e., the multidroplet regime. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we\nfind that the system undergoes a nonequilibrium phase transition, in which the\nsymmetry-broken dynamic phase corresponds to an asymmetric stationary limit\ncycle for the time-dependent magnetization. The critical point is located where\nthe half-period of the external field is approximately equal to the metastable\nlifetime of the system. We employ finite-size scaling analysis to investigate\nthe characteristics of this dynamical phase transition. The critical exponents\nand the fixed-point value of the fourth-order cumulant are found to be\nconsistent with the universality class of the two-dimensional equilibrium Ising\nmodel. As this universality class has previously been established for the same\nnonequilibrium model evolving under the standard Glauber dynamic, our results\nindicate that this far-from-equilibrium phase transition is universal with\nrespect to the choice of the stochastic dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2008 21:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-14"}

The reversible formation of an\nadsorbed film, which precedes capillary condensation, results in an extension\nof the porous material while, in the hysteresis region, the negative liquid\npressures under the concave menisci contract the porous matrix. The elastic\ndeformation exhibits an hysteresis loop in the same pressure region as the\nadsorption phenomenon.

This approach is\ngeneric to all porous materials. Thermodynamics of adsorption is directly\nconnected to the elastic properties of the porous solid. We find that the\nvariation of the surface free energy related to the elastic deformation is an\nimportant component of the total free energy.

To test this idea, we perform a number of\ninter-related cosmographic fits to the legacy05 and gold06 supernova datasets.\nBased on this supernova data, the \"preponderance of evidence\" certainly\nsuggests an accelerating universe. However we would argue that (unless one uses\nadditional dynamical and observational information) this conclusion is not\ncurrently supported \"beyond reasonable doubt\". As part of the analysis we\ndevelop two particularly transparent graphical representations of the\nredshift-distance relation -- representations in which acceleration versus\ndeceleration reduces to the question of whether the relevant graph slopes up or\ndown. Turning to the details of the cosmographic fits, three issues in\nparticular concern us: First, the fitted value for the deceleration parameter\nchanges significantly depending on whether one performs a chi^2 fit to the\nluminosity distance, proper motion distance or other suitable distance\nsurrogate. Second, the fitted value for the deceleration parameter changes\nsignificantly depending on whether one uses the traditional redshift variable\nz, or what we shall argue is on theoretical grounds an improved\nparameterization y=z/(1+z). Third, the published estimates for systematic\nuncertainties are sufficiently large that they certainly impact on, and to a\nlarge extent undermine, the usual purely statistical tests of significance.

We measure the fluxes at the four FIS bands\n(wavelengths of 65 um, 90 um, 140 um, and 160 um). Based on these fluxes, we\nestimate basic quantities about dust: dust temperature, dust mass, and total\nFIR luminosity. We find that the typical dust temperature of the BCD sample is\nsystematically higher than that of normal spiral galaxies, although there is a\nlarge variety. The interstellar radiation field estimated from the dust\ntemperature ranges up to 100 times of the Galactic value. This confirms the\nconcentrated star-forming activity in BCDs. The star formation rate can be\nevaluated from the FIR luminosity as 0.01--0.5 $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Combining\nthis quantity with gas mass taken from the literature, we estimate the gas\nconsumption timescales (gas mass divided by the star formation rate), which\nprove to span a wide range from 1 Gyr to 100 Gyr. A natural interpretation of\nthis large variety can be provided by intermittent star formation activity. We\nfinally show the relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity (we utilize\nour estimate of dust mass, and take other necessary quantities from the\nliterature). There is a positive correlation between dust-to-gas ratio and\nmetallicity as expected from chemical evolution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2008 06:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

Assuming Brown et al.'s estimate of\nthe size of progenitors, we find that the probability that a Kuiper belt object\nwas involved in such a collision since primordial times is less than roughly\n0.001. In addition, it is not possible for the collision to have occurred in a\nmassive primordial Kuiper belt because the dynamical coherence of the family\nwould not have survived whatever event produced the currently observed orbital\nexcitation. Here we suggest that the family is the result of a collision\nbetween two scattered disk objects.

But such models\nare manifestly insufficient to explain the strong variations in superconducting\ncritical temperature Tc among cuprates which have identical hole-density but\nare crystallographically different outside the CuO2 plane. A key challenge,\ntherefore, has been to identify a predominant out-of-plane influence\ncontrolling the superconductivity - with much attention focusing on the\ndistance $d_A$ between the apical oxygen and the planar copper atom. Here we\nreport direct determination of how variations of inter-atomic distances within\nindividual crystalline unit cells, affect the superconducting energy-gap\nmaximum $\\Delta$ of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8. In this material, quasi-periodic variations\nof unit cell geometry occur in the form of a bulk crystalline\n'supermodulation'. Within each supermodulation period, we find a $\\sim 9\\pm1%$\nco-sinusoidal variation in local $\\Delta$ that is anti-correlated with the\nassociated $d_A$ variations. Furthermore, we show that phenomenological\nconsistency would exist between these effects and the random $\\Delta$\nvariations found near dopant atoms if the primary effect of the interstitial\ndopant atom is to displace the apical oxygen so as to diminish $d_A$ or tilt\nthe CuO5 pyramid.

The origin of the \"blow-out\" is not well\nunderstood while it is suggested that there is another supernova remnant here\nin radio observation. To investigate the detail structure of this region in\nX-ray, we divided our fields of view into 33 box regions. The spectra are well\nfitted by a two-component nonequilibrium ionization model. The emission measure\ndistributions of heavy elements decrease from the inner region to the outer\nregion of the Loop. Then, we also divided our fields of view into 26 annular\nsectors to examine the radial plasma structure. Judging from metal abundances\nobtained, it is consistent with that the X-ray emission is the Cygnus Loop\norigin and we concluded that high-$kT_{e}$ component ($\\sim$0.4 keV) originates\nfrom the ejecta while low-$kT_{e}$ component ($\\sim$0.2 keV) is derived from\nthe swept-up interstellar medium. The flux of low-$kT_{e}$ component is much\nless than that of high-$kT_{e}$ component, suggesting the ISM component is very\nthin. Also, the relative abundances in the ejecta component shows similar\nvalues to those obtained from previous observations of the Cygnus Loop. We find\nno evidence in X-ray that the nature of the \"blow-out\" region originated from\nthe extra supernova remnant.

These quantum fast-roll\ninitial conditions for the inflaton allow for kinetic energies of the same\norder of the potential energies and nonperturbative inflaton modes with nonzero\nwavenumbers. Their evolution starts with a transitory epoch where the redshift\ndue to the expansion succeeds to assemble the quantum excited modes of the\ninflaton in a homogeneous (zero mode) condensate, and the large value of the\nHubble parameter succeeds to overdamp the fast-roll of the redshifted inflaton\nmodes. After this transitory stage the effective classical slow-roll epoch is\nreached. Most of the efolds are produced during the slow-roll epoch and we\nrecover the classical slow-roll results for the scalar and tensor metric\nperturbations plus corrections.

By repeating all\ncalculations with and without spin-orbit coupling, no substantial spin-orbit\ninduced change emerges either in the chain-molecule interaction mechanism or in\nthe conductance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2008 14:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Some have\ncharacteristic times of a few days; others evolve on thousands of years. All\nthese structures are interdependent; in other words, they communicate. It is\noften considered that the only way to cope with climate complexity is to\nintegrate the equations of atmospheric and oceanic motion with the finer\npossible mesh. Is this the sole strategy? Aren't we missing another\ncharacteristic of the climate system: its ability to destroy and generate\ninformation at the macroscopic scale? Paleoclimatologists consider that much of\nthis information is present in palaeoclimate archives. It is therefore natural\nto build climate models such as to get the most of these archives. The strategy\nproposed here is based on Bayesian statistics and low-order non-linear\ndynamical systems, in a modelling approach that explicitly includes the effects\nof uncertainties. Its practical interest is illustrated through the problem of\nthe timing of the next great glaciation. Is glacial inception overdue, or do we\nneed to wait for another 50,000 years before ice caps grow again?

A central question is whether the ligand\ninduces the conformational change (induced-fit), or rather selects and\nstabilizes a complementary conformation from a pre-existing equilibrium of\nground and excited states of the protein (selected-fit). We consider here the\nbinding kinetics in a simple four-state model of ligand-protein binding. In\nthis model, the protein has two conformations, which can both bind the ligand.\nThe first conformation is the ground state of the protein when the ligand is\noff, and the second conformation is the ground state when the ligand is bound.\nThe induced-fit mechanism corresponds to ligand binding in the unbound ground\nstate, and the selected-fit mechanism to ligand binding in the excited state.\nWe find a simple, characteristic difference between the on- and off-rates in\nthe two mechanisms if the conformational relaxation into the ground states is\nfast. In the case of selected-fit binding, the on-rate depends on the\nconformational equilibrium constant, while the off-rate is independent. In the\ncase of induced-fit binding, in contrast, the off-rate depends on the\nconformational equilibrium, while the on-rate is independent. Whether a protein\nbinds a ligand via selected-fit or induced-fit thus may be revealed by\nmutations far from the protein's binding pocket, or other \"perturbations\" that\nonly affect the conformational equilibrium. In the case of selected-fit, such\nmutations will only change the on-rate, and in the case of induced-fit, only\nthe off-rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2008 14:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-04"}

To confirm this expectation, we used the\nMid-Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (completed by the Midcourse Space Experiment\nsatellite) to search for bow shocks around a number of young ($\\la$ several\nMyr) clusters and OB associations. We discovered dozens of bow shocks generated\nby OB stars running away from these stellar systems, supporting the idea of\nsignificant dynamical loss of OB stars. In this paper, we report the discovery\nof three bow shocks produced by O-type stars ejected from the open cluster\nNGC6611 (M16). One of the bow shocks is associated with the O9.5Iab star\nHD165319, which was suggested to be one of \"the best examples for isolated\nGalactic high-mass star formation\" (de Wit et al. 2005, A&A, 437, 247).\nPossible implications of our results for the origin of field OB stars are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2008 15:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 13:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

If a smooth affine surface V admits more than one C*-action\nthen it is known to be Gizatullin i.e., it can be completed by a linear chain\nof smooth rational curves. In our previous paper we gave a sufficient\ncondition, in terms of the Dolgachev- Pinkham-Demazure (or DPD) presentation,\nfor the uniqueness of a C*-action on a Gizatullin surface. In the present paper\nwe show that this condition is also necessary, at least in the smooth case. In\nfact, if the uniqueness fails for a smooth Gizatullin surface V which is\nneither toric nor Danilov-Gizatullin, then V admits a continuous family of\npairwise non-conjugated C*-actions depending on one or two parameters. We give\nan explicit description of all such surfaces and their C*-actions in terms of\nDPD presentations. We also show that for every k > 0 one can find a Danilov-\nGizatullin surface V (n) of index n = n(k) with a family of pairwise\nnon-conjugate C+-actions depending on k parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2008 15:45:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2008 14:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-08"}

However,\nit is not clear whether such activity states are specific to simple IF models,\nor if they also exist in networks where neurons are endowed with complex\nintrinsic properties similar to electrophysiological measurements. Here, we\ninvestigate the occurrence of AI states in networks of nonlinear IF neurons,\nsuch as the adaptive exponential IF (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) model. This\nmodel can display intrinsic properties such as low-threshold spike (LTS),\nregular spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS). We successively investigate the\noscillatory and AI dynamics of thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical networks\nusing such models. AI states can be found in each case, sometimes with\nsurprisingly small network size of the order of a few tens of neurons. We show\nthat the presence of LTS neurons in cortex or in thalamus, explains the robust\nemergence of AI states for relatively small network sizes. Finally, we\ninvestigate the role of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). In cortical networks\nwith strong SFA in RS cells, the AI state is transient, but when SFA is\nreduced, AI states can be self-sustained for long times. In thalamocortical\nnetworks, AI states are found when the cortex is itself in an AI state, but\nwith strong SFA, the thalamocortical network displays Up and Down state\ntransitions, similar to intracellular recordings during slow-wave sleep or\nanesthesia. Self-sustained Up and Down states could also be generated by\ntwo-layer cortical networks with LTS cells. These models suggest that intrinsic\nproperties such as LTS are crucial for AI states in thalamocortical networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2008 15:55:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Dec 2008 14:22:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 08:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 10 May 2009 13:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-27"}
