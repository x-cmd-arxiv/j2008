Such statistic is the dipole of CMB\ntemperature fluctuations evaluated over the pixels of the cluster catalog\n(Kashlinsky & Atrio-Barandela 2000). To remove the cosmological CMB\nfluctuations the maps are Wiener-filtered in each of the eight WMAP channels\n(Q, V, W) which have negligible foreground component. Our findings are as\nfollows: The thermal SZ (TSZ) component of the clusters is described well by\nthe Navarro-Frenk-White profile expected if the hot gas traces the dark matter\nin the cluster potential wells. Such gas has X-ray temperature decreasing\nrapidly towards the cluster outskirts, which we demonstrate results in the\ndecrease of the TSZ component as the aperture is increased to encompass the\ncluster outskirts. We then detect a statistically significant dipole in the CMB\npixels at cluster positions. Arising exclusively at the cluster pixels this\ndipole cannot originate from the foreground or instrument noise emissions and\nmust be produced by the CMB photons which interacted with the hot intracluster\ngas via the SZ effect. The dipole remains as the monopole component, due to the\nTSZ effect, vanishes within the small statistical noise out to the maximal\naperture where we still detect the TSZ component. We demonstrate with\nsimulations that the mask and cross-talk effects are small for our catalog and\ncontribute negligibly to the measurements.

Studies of the migration of planets in\nstandard gas disk models routinely show that migration is too fast to form\nJovian planets, and that such migrating planetary cores generally plunge into\nthe central stars in less than a Myr. In previous work, we have shown that a\npoorly ionized, less viscous region in a protoplanetary disk called a dead zone\nslows down the migration of fixed-mass planets. In this paper, we extend our\nnumerical calculations to include dead zone evolution along with the disk, as\nwell as planet formation via accretion of rocky and gaseous materials. Using\nour symplectic-integrator-gas dynamics code, we find that dead zones, even in\nevolving disks wherein migrating planets grow by accretion, still play a\nfundamental role in saving planetary systems. We demonstrate that Jovian\nplanets form within 2.5 Myr for disks that are ten times more massive than a\nminimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) with an opacity reduction and without slowing\ndown migration artificially. Our simulations indicate that protoplanetary disks\nwith an initial mass comparable to the MMSN only produce Neptunian mass\nplanets. We also find that planet migration does not help core accretion as\nmuch in the oligarchic planetesimal accretion scenario as it was expected in\nthe runaway accretion scenario. Therefore we expect that an opacity reduction\n(or some other mechanisms) is needed to solve the formation timescale problem\neven for migrating protoplanets, as long as we consider the oligarchic growth.\nWe also point out a possible role of a dead zone in explaining long-lived,\nstrongly accreting gas disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2008 17:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In\nall the simulations performed, the post-collision gas flow forms an inner,\nnearly circular gaseous disc and one or two eccentric outer filaments,\nconsistent with the observations. Furthermore, the radial stellar mass\ndistribution is always very steep, Sigma proportional to R^-2, again consistent\nwith the observations. All of our simulations produce discs that are warped by\nbetween 30 to 60 degrees, in accordance with the most recent observations. The\n3D velocity structure of the stellar distribution is sensitive to initial\nconditions (e.g., the impact parameter of the clouds) and gas cooling details.\nFor example, the runs in which the inner disc is fed intermittently with\nmaterial possessing fluctuating angular momentum result in multiple stellar\ndiscs with different orbital orientations, contradicting the observed data. In\nall the cases the amount of gas accreted by our inner boundary condition is\nlarge, enough to allow Sgr A* to radiate near its Eddington limit over approx.\n10^5 years.

Both affect and respond to the collective gravitational field. We\nfind that all subsonic, radially continuous, steady solutions require a\nnon-zero minimum central point mass. For Mpc-sized halos with 7 to 10 effective\ndegrees of freedom (F2), the minimum central mass is compatible with\nobservations of supermassive black holes. Smaller gas mass influxes enable\nsmaller central masses for wider ranges of F2. The halo comprises a sharp spike\naround the central mass, embedded within a core of nearly constant density (at\n10-10^2.5kpc scales), with outskirts that attenuate and naturally truncate at\nfinite radius (several Mpc). The gas density resembles a broken power law in\nradius, but the temperature dips and peaks within the dark core. A finite\nminimum temperature occurs due to gravitational self-warming, without cold mass\ndropout nor needing regulatory heating.

The simulated tilted disks showed dramatic\ndifferences from comparable untilted disks, such as asymmetrical accretion onto\nthe hole through opposing \"plunging streams\" and global precession of the disk\npowered by a torque provided by the black hole. However, those simulations used\na traditional spherical-polar grid that was purposefully underresolved along\nthe pole, which prevented us from assessing the behavior of any jets that may\nhave been associated with the tilted disks. To address this shortcoming we have\nadded a block-structured \"cubed-sphere\" grid option to the Cosmos++ GRMHD code,\nwhich will allow us to simultaneously resolve the disk and polar regions. Here\nwe present our implementation of this grid and the results of a small suite of\nvalidation tests intended to demonstrate that the new grid performs as\nexpected. The most important test in this work is a comparison of identical\ntilted disks, one evolved using our spherical-polar grid and the other with the\ncubed-sphere grid. We also demonstrate an interesting dependence of the\nearly-time evolution of our disks on their orientation with respect to the grid\nalignment. This dependence arises from the differing treatment of current\nsheets within the disks, especially whether they are aligned with symmetry\nplanes of the grid or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2008 22:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The dynamics is\ncomplicated by extreme perihelion precession compounded by spin-induced\nprecession. We are able to quantitatively define and describe the fully three\ndimensional motion of comparable mass binaries with one black hole spinning and\nexpose an underlying simplicity. To do so, we untangle the dynamics by\ncapturing the motion in the orbital plane. Our results are twofold: (1) We\nderive highly simplified equations of motion in a non-orthogonal orbital basis,\nand (2) we define a complete taxonomy for fully three-dimensional orbits. More\nthan just a naming system, the taxonomy provides unambiguous and quantitative\ndescriptions of the orbits, including a determination of the zoom-whirliness of\nany given orbit. Through a correspondence with the rationals, we are able to\nshow that zoom-whirl behavior is prevalent in comparable mass binaries in the\nstrong-field regime. A first significant conclusion that can be drawn from this\nanalysis is that all generic orbits in the final stages of inspiral under\ngravitational radiation losses are characterized by precessing clovers with few\nleaves and that no orbit will behave like the tightly precessing ellipse of\nMercury. The gravitational waveform produced by these low-leaf clovers will\nreflect the natural harmonics of the orbital basis -- harmonics that,\nimportantly, depend only on radius.

Based on technology\ndeveloped for CUORICINO and its predecessors, CUORE is a next-generation\nexperiment designed to probe neutrino mass in the range of 10 - 100 meV. Latest\nresults from CUORICINO and overview of the progress and current status of CUORE\nare presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2008 02:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

One of\nthe emerging solitons is always stable in its existence region and the other is\nalways unstable. We argue that the critical amplitude for supratransmission is\nthen the same as the critical driving amplitude of the saddle-node bifurcation.\nWe consider as well the case of the forcing frequency in the lower forbidden\nband. It is discussed briefly that there is no supratransmission because in\nthis case there is only one rapidly decaying static soliton that exists and is\nstable for any driving amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2008 07:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-24"}

It has also\nbeen suggested as a way to amplify magnetic fields in discs, the instability\nacting as a nonlinear dynamo. Recent numerical work has shown that a\nlarge-scale magnetic field, which is predominantly azimuthal, can be sustained\nby motions driven by the MRI of this same field. Following this idea, we\npresent an analytical calculation of the MRI in the presence of an azimuthal\nfield with a non-trivial vertical structure. We find that the mean radial EMF\nassociated to MRI modes tends to reduce the magnetic energy, acting like a\nturbulent resistivity by mixing the non-uniform azimuthal field. Meanwhile, the\nazimuthal EMF generates a radial field that, in combination with the Keplerian\nshear, tends to amplify the azimuthal field and can therefore assist in the\ndynamo process. This effect, however, is reversed for sufficiently strong\nazimuthal fields, naturally leading to a saturation of the dynamo and possibly\nto a cyclic behaviour of the magnetic field, as found in previous numerical\nworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2008 09:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Both radial and\ntransverse motions with relativistic velocities are considered. The lens\nequation is derived by first considering geodesic motion of photons in the\nrest-frame Schwarzschild spacetime of the lens, and, then, light-ray detection\nin the moving observer's frame. Due to the transverse motion images are\ndisplaced and distorted in the observer's celestial sphere, whereas the radial\nvelocity along the line of sight causes an effective re-scaling of the lens\nmass.

Gamma-Ray\nBursts (GRBs) are one of the main scientific targets of the AGILE mission and\nthe MCAL design as an independent self-triggering detector makes it a valuable\nall-sky monitor for GRBs.

Small stellar clusters, with a stellar mass of several\n10^6 M_sun, and low-mass black holes (BHs), with a mass of several 10^5 M_sun\nshould be directly detectable out to redshift z=10, and individual supernovae\n(SNe) and gamma ray burst (GRB) afterglows are bright enough to be visible\nbeyond this redshift.

The direct light emitted by the very first stellar clusters\nand intermediate-mass black holes at z>10 will likely fall below JWST's\ndetection threshold. However, JWST could reveal a decline at the faint-end of\nthe high-redshift luminosity function, and thereby shed light on radiative and\nother feedback effects that operate at these early epochs. JWST will also have\nthe sensitivity to detect individual SNe from beyond z=10. In a dedicated\nsurvey lasting for several weeks, thousands of SNe could be detected at z>6,\nwith a redshift distribution extending to the formation of the very first stars\nat z>15. Using these SNe as tracers may be the only method to map out the\nearliest stages of the cosmic star-formation history.

No other PGA Tour player in our sample could have come close\nto such a feat. We also are able to quantify the intimidation factor associated\nwith playing with Woods. On average, players who were paired with Woods during\nthe 1998-2001 period scored 0.462 strokes per round worse than normal. Although\nwe find that Woods' presence in a tournament may have had a small, but\nstatistically significant adverse impact on the entire field, this effect was\nswamped by the apparent intimidation factor associated with having to play with\nTiger side-by-side.\n  We also demonstrate that Phil Mickelson's performance in major golf\nchampionships over the 1998-2001 period was not nearly as bad as was frequently\nmentioned in the golf press. Although Mickelson won no majors during this\nperiod, he played sufficiently well to have won one or two majors under normal\ncircumstances. Moreover, his overall performance in majors, relative to his\nestimated skill level, was comparable to that of Tiger Woods, who won five of\n16 major golf championships during our four-year sample period. Thus, the\ngeneral characterization of Woods as golf's dominant player over the 1998-2001\nperiod was accurate, but the frequent characterization of Phil Mickelson\nchoking in majors was not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2008 14:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-24"}

From the continuum observations we show that the\nionized shell of IRAS 17347-3139 consists of two main structures: one extended\n(size ~1\". 5) with bipolar morphology along PA=-30 degrees, elongated in the\nsame direction as the lobes observed in the near-infrared images, and a central\ncompact structure (size ~0\". 25) elongated in the direction perpendicular to\nthe bipolar axis, coinciding with the equatorial dark lane observed in the\nnear-infrared images.

N-band visibilities were obtained\nwith VLTI/MIDI. Simple geometrical models are used to compare the dust emission\nto high-resolution optical spectra in the 6300 AA [OI] line of the same\ntargets. The disks around HD 101412 and HD 135344 B appear strongly flared in\nthe gas, but self-shadowed in the dust beyond ~ 2 AU. In both systems, the 10\nmicron emission is rather compact (< 2 AU) while the [OI] brightness profile\nshows a double peaked structure. The inner peak is strongest and is consistent\nwith the location of the dust, the outer peak is fainter and is located at 5-10\nAU. Spatially extended PAH emission is found in both disks. The disk around HD\n179218 is flared in the dust. The 10 micron emission emerges from a double\nring-like structure with the first ring peaking at ~ 1 AU and the second at ~\n20 AU. No dust emission is detected between ~ 3 -- 15 AU. The oxygen emission\nseems also to come from a flared structure, however, the bulk of this emission\nis produced between ~ 1 -- 10 AU. This could indicate a lack of gas in the\nouter disk or could be due to chemical effects which reduce the abundance of OH\n-- the parent molecule of the observed [OI] emission -- further away from the\nstar. The three systems, HD 179218, HD 135344 B and HD 101412, may form an\nevolutionary sequence: the disk initially flared becomes flat under the\ncombined action of gas-dust decoupling, grain growth and dust settling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2008 15:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-16"}
