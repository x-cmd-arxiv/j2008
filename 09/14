The setup assumes a packet\nerasure channel and that nodes cannot transmit and receive information\nsimultaneously. The sender transmits coded data packets back-to-back before\nstopping to wait for the receiver to acknowledge (ACK) the number of degrees of\nfreedom, if any, that are required to decode correctly the information. We\nprovide an analysis of this problem to show that there is an optimal number of\ncoded data packets, in terms of mean completion time, to be sent before\nstopping to listen. This number depends on the latency, probabilities of packet\nerasure and ACK erasure, and the number of degrees of freedom that the receiver\nrequires to decode the data. This scheme is optimal in terms of the mean time\nto complete the transmission of a fixed number of data packets. We show that\nits performance is very close to that of a full duplex system, while\ntransmitting a different number of coded packets can cause large degradation in\nperformance, especially if latency is high. Also, we study the throughput\nperformance of our scheme and compare it to existing half-duplex Go-back-N and\nSelective Repeat ARQ schemes. Numerical results, obtained for different\nlatencies, show that our scheme has similar performance to the Selective Repeat\nin most cases and considerable performance gain when latency and packet error\nprobability is high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Sep 2008 16:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-16"}

We consider properties that are\ndescribed by a single forbidden pattern (and its linear transformations), i.e.,\na property is given by $k$ points $v_{1},...,v_{k}\\in\\cube^{k}$ and\n$f:\\cube^{n}\\to\\cube$ satisfies the property that if for all linear maps\n$L:\\cube^{k}\\to\\cube^{n}$ it is the case that $f(L(v_{1})),...,f(L(v_{k}))$ do\nnot all equal 1. We show that this property is testable if the underlying\nmatroid specified by $v_{1},...,v_{k}$ is a graphic matroid. This extends\nGreen's result to an infinite class of new properties.\n  Our techniques extend those of Green and in particular we establish a link\nbetween the notion of \"1-complexity linear systems\" of Green and Tao, and\ngraphic matroids, to derive the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Sep 2008 02:44:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2009 18:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-20"}

For a\nHopf algebra $B$ in a braided monoidal category $\\C$, and under certain\nassumptions on the braiding (fulfilled if $\\C$ is symmetric), we construct a\nsequence for the Brauer group $\\BM(\\C;B)$ of $B$-module algebras, generalizing\nBeattie's one.

This equation exhibits\nspontaneous emergence of singular solutions (peakons) from smooth initial\nconditions. The CH equation has been recently extended to a two-component\nintegrable system (CH2), which includes both velocity and density variables in\nthe dynamics. Although possessing peakon solutions in the velocity, the CH2\nequation does not admit singular solutions in the density profile. We modify\nthe CH2 system to allow dependence on average density as well as pointwise\ndensity. The modified CH2 system (MCH2) does admit peakon solutions in velocity\nand average density. We analytically identify the steepening mechanism that\nallows the singular solutions to emerge from smooth spatially-confined initial\ndata. Numerical results for MCH2 are given and compared with the pure CH2 case.\nThese numerics show that the modification in MCH2 to introduce average density\nhas little short-time effect on the emergent dynamical properties. However, an\nanalytical and numerical study of pairwise peakon interactions for MCH2 shows a\nnew asymptotic feature.
