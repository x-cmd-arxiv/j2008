Within\nthe context of non-relativistic Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the\ncharacteristic acceleration scale of the theory appears to be related to the\ncurrent value of either the Hubble constant, i.e., alpha ~ cH_0, or the dark\nenergy density, i.e., alpha (8 pi G rho_lambda/3)^{1/2}. If these relations are\nthe manifestation of a fundamental coupling of a_0 to either of the two\ncosmological parameters, the cosmological evolution would then dictate a\nparticular dependence of the MOND acceleration scale with redshift that can be\ntested with Tully-Fisher relations of high-redshift galaxies. We compare this\nprediction to two sets of Tully-Fisher data with redshifts up to z=1.2. We find\nthat both couplings are excluded within the formal uncertainties. However, when\nwe take into account the potential systematic uncertainties in the data, we\nfind that they marginally favor the coupling of the MOND acceleration scale to\nthe density of dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2008 16:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-18"}

It has been speculated that the peak of the separation distribution of\nbrown dwarf binaries lies right in the unprobed range. This work extends\nhigh-precision radial velocity surveys of brown dwarfs for the first time out\nto 3 AU. Based on more than six years UVES/VLT spectroscopy the binary\nfrequency of brown dwarfs and (very) low-mass stars (M4.25-M8) in ChaI was\ndetermined: 18% for the whole sample and 10% for the subsample of ten brown\ndwarfs and VLMS (M < 0.1 Msun). Two spectroscopic binaries were confirmed, the\nbrown dwarf candidate ChaHa8 (previously discovered by Joergens & Mueller) and\nthe low-mass star CHXR74. Since their orbital separations appear to be 1 AU or\ngreater, the binary frequency at < 1 AU might be less than 10%. Now for the\nfirst time companion searches of (young) brown dwarfs cover the whole orbital\nseparation range, and the following observational constraints for models of\nbrown dwarf formation can be derived: (i) the frequency of brown dwarf and very\nlow-mass stellar binaries at < 3 AU does not significantly exceed that at > 3\nAU; i.e. direct imaging surveys do not miss a significant fraction of brown\ndwarf binaries; (ii) the overall binary frequency of brown dwarfs and very\nlow-mass stars is 10-30 %; (iii) the decline in the separation distribution of\nbrown dwarfs towards smaller separations seems to occur between 1 and 3 AU;\n(iv) the observed continuous decrease in the binary frequency from the stellar\nto the substellar regime is confirmed at < 3 AU providing further evidence of a\ncontinuous formation mechanism from low-mass stars to brown dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2008 20:04:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2008 13:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These spectra, having a\nminimally discernible hard X-ray excess, are an excellent test of modern disk\natmosphere models that include the effects of black hole spin. The HETG data\nshow that the soft disk spectrum is only very mildly absorbed with N_H =1-2 X\n10^{21} cm^-2. These data additionally reveal 13.449 A NeIX absorption\nconsistent with the warm/hot phase of the interstellar medium.

We show, however, that pure Schwarzschild\nblack hole models describe the data extremely well, albeit with large disk\natmosphere ``color-correction'' factors.

The models track the\nproduction of both iron and alpha elements. A model is chosen that provides an\nexcellent fit to the metallicity distribution of stars in the Geneva-Copenhagen\nsurvey (GCS) of the solar neighbourhood, and a good fit to the local Hess\ndiagram. The model provides a good fit to the distribution of GCS stars in the\nage-metallicity plane although this plane was not used in the fitting process.\nAlthough this model's star-formation rate is monotonic declining, its disc\nnaturally splits into an alpha-enhanced thick disc and a normal thin disc. In\nparticular the model's distribution of stars in the ([O/Fe],[Fe/H]) plane\nresembles that of Galactic stars in displaying a ridge line for each disc. The\nthin-disc's ridge line is entirely due to stellar migration and there is the\ncharacteristic variation of stellar angular momentum along it that has been\nnoted by Haywood in survey data. Radial mixing of stellar populations with high\nsigma_z from inner regions of the disc to the solar neighbourhood provides a\nnatural explanation of why measurements yield a steeper increase of sigma_z\nwith age than predicted by theory. The metallicity gradient in the ISM is\npredicted to be steeper than in earlier models, but appears to be in good\nagreement with data for both our Galaxy and external galaxies. The models are\ninconsistent with a cutoff in the star-formation rate at low gas surface\ndensities. The absolute magnitude of the disc is given as a function of time in\nseveral photometric bands, and radial colour profiles are plotted for\nrepresentative times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2008 20:35:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 21:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The low surface-gravity dwarfs are\nkinematically younger than the overall population, and the kinematics of the\nred and blue ultracool dwarfs suggest ages that are younger and older than the\nfull sample, respectively.

Our measurements reveal that the heating scheme\nand the details of the contact geometry play the dominant role in determining\nthe final phase composition of the device such that a non-uniform heating\nscheme promotes partial amorphization/crystallization for a wide range of pulse\nparameters enabling multiple resistance levels for data storage applications.\nFurthermore we find that fluctuations in the snap-back voltage and set/reset\nresistances in repeated switching experiments are related to the details of the\ncurrent distribution such that a uniform current injection geometry (i.e.\ncircular contact) favors more reproducible switching parameters. This shows\nthat possible geometrical defects in nanoscale phase change memory devices may\nplay an essential role in the performance of the smallest possible devices\nthrough modification of the exact current distribution in the active\nchalcogenide layer. We present a three-dimensional finite element model of the\nelectro-thermal physics to provide insights into the underlying physical\nmechanisms of the switching dynamics as well as to quantitatively account for\nthe scaling behaviour of the switching currents in both circular and\nrectangular contact geometries. The calculated temporal evolution of the heat\ndistribution within the pulse duration shows distinct features in rectangular\ncontacts providing evidence for locally hot spots at the sharp corners of the\ncurrent injection site due to current crowding effects leading to the observed\nbehaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2008 22:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It consists of correlating the lensing\nsignal (either shear or magnification) of a background galaxy/quasar sample\nwith the number density of a foreground galaxy sample. However, the foreground\ngalaxy density is inevitably altered by the magnification bias due to the mass\nbetween the foreground and the observer, leading to a correction to the\nobserved galaxy-lensing signal. The aim of this paper is to quantify this\ncorrection. The single most important determining factor is the foreground\nredshift z: the correction is small if the foreground galaxies are at low\nredshifts but can become non-negligible for sufficiently high redshifts. For\ninstance, we find that for the multipole l=1000, the correction is above\n1%*(5s-2)/b for z<0.37, and above 5%*(5s-2)/b for z<0.67, where s is the number\ncount slope of the foreground sample, and b its galaxy bias. These\nconsiderations are particularly important for geometrical measures, such as the\nJain and Taylor ratio or its generalization by Zhang et al. Assuming\n(5s-2)/b=1, we find that the foreground redshift should be limited to z<0.45 in\norder to avoid biasing the inferred dark energy equation of state w by more\nthan 5%, and that even for a low foreground redshift (< 0.45), the background\nsamples must be well separated from the foreground to avoid incurring a bias of\nsimilar magnitude. Lastly, we briefly comment on the possibility of obtaining\nthese geometrical measures without using galaxy shapes, using instead\nmagnification bias itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2008 15:53:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2009 18:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-05"}

Here, we apply this general idea\nto black hole binaries. It is assumed that a test particle experiences a\nsimilar parametric resonance mechanism such as the one described in paper I and\nII but now the resonance is induced by the interaction between a spiral density\nwave in the accretion disk, excited close to the innermost stable circular\norbit, and vertical epicyclic oscillations. We use the Kerr spacetime geometry\nto deduce the characteristic frequencies of this test particle. The response of\nthe test particle is maximal when the frequency ratio of the two strongest\nresonances is equal to 3:2 as observed in black hole candidates. Finally,\napplying our model to the microquasar GRS 1915+105, we reproduce the correct\nvalue of several HF-QPOs. Indeed the presence of the 168/113/56/42/28 Hz\nfeatures in the power spectrum time analysis is predicted.

About 25% of lenses\nin the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) appear to have luminous satellites\nwithin ~ 5 kpc/h of the main lensing galaxies, which are usually at redshift z\n~ 0.2-1. In this work we use the Millennium Simulation combined with galaxy\ncatalogues from semi-analytical techniques to study the predicted frequency of\nsuch satellites in simulated haloes. The fraction of haloes that host bright\nsatellites within the (projected) central regions is similar for red and blue\nhosts and is found to increase as a function of host halo mass and redshift.\nSpecifically, at z = 1, about 11% of galaxy-sized haloes (with masses between\n10^{12} M_sun/h and 10^{13} M_sun/h) host bright satellite galaxies within a\nprojected radius of 5 kpc/h. This fraction increases to about 17% (25%) if we\nconsider bright (all) satellites of only group-sized haloes (with masses\nbetween 10^{13} M_sun/h and 10^{14} M_sun/h). These results are roughly\nconsistent with the fraction (~ 25%) of CLASS lensing galaxies observed to host\nluminous satellites. At z = 0, only ~ 3% of galaxy-sized haloes host bright\nsatellite galaxies. The fraction rises to ~ 6%, (10%) if we consider bright\n(all) satellites of only group-sized haloes at z = 0. However, most of the\nsatellites found in the inner regions are `orphan' galaxies where the dark\nmatter haloes have been completely stripped. Thus the agreement crucially\ndepends on the true survival rate of these `orphan' galaxies.

Since non-local correlations\nare more useful if they are stronger, it is natural to ask whether weak\nnon-locality can be amplified. We give an affirmative answer by presenting the\nfirst protocol for distilling non-locality in the framework of generalized\nnon-signaling theories. Our protocol works for both quantum and non-quantum\ncorrelations.

In\nthe present paper we analyze the CaT strength (WCaT), and kinematical products\nderived in that study, namely stellar and ionized gas velocity dispersions. Our\nmain results may be summarized as follows: (1) Seyfert 2s show no sign of\ndilution in WCaT with respect to the values spanned by normal galaxies, even\nwhen optical absorption lines such as the CaII K band at 3933 A are much weaker\nthan in old, bulge-like stellar populations. (2) The location of Seyfert 2s in\nthe WCaT-WCaK plane is consistent with evolutionary synthesis models. The\nimplication is that the source responsible for the dilution of optical lines in\nthese AGN is a young stellar population, rather than an AGN featureless\ncontinuum, confirming the conclusion of the pioneer study of Terlevich, Diaz &\nTerlevich. (3) In Seyfert 1s, both W[SIII] and WCaT tend to be diluted due to\nthe presence of a non-stellar component, in agreement with the unification\nparadigm. (4) A comparison of stellar and gas velocity dispersions confirms the\nexistence of a correlation between the typical velocities of stars and clouds\nof the Narrow Line Region. The strength and scatter around this correlation are\nsimilar to those previously obtained from the [OIII]5007 line width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2008 15:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

This\nidea is the basis of a general strategy, called DataBase Monte Carlo (DBMC),\nfor improving efficiency of Monte Carlo. In this paper we describe how this\nstrategy can be implemented using the variance reduction technique of Control\nVariates (CV). We show that, once an initial setup cost for extracting\ninformation is incurred, this approach can lead to significant gains in\ncomputational efficiency.

The in-plane elastomer deformation is monitored during the incipient\nsliding regime, i.e. the transition between static and sliding contact. As the\nshear load is increased, an annular slip region, in coexistence with a central\nstick region, is found to progressively invade the contact. From the\ninterfacial displacement field, the tangential stress field can be further\ncomputed using a numerical inversion procedure. These local mechanical\nmeasurements are found to be correctly captured by Cattaneo and Mindlin (CM)'s\nmodel. However, close comparison reveals significant discrepancies in both the\ndisplacements and stress fields that reflect the oversimplifying hypothesis\nunderlying CM's scenario. In particular, our optical measurements allow us to\nexhibit an elasto-plastic like friction constitutive equation that differs from\nthe rigid-plastic behavior assumed in CM's model. This local constitutive law,\nwhich involves a roughness-related length scale, is consistent with the model\nof Bureau \\textit{et al.} [Proc. R. Soc.

Small deviations are observed and interpreted as\na result of the finite compliance of the rough interface, a behavior which\ncontrasts with Amontons' law of friction assumed to be valid locally in CM's\nmodel.
