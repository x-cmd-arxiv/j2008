What makes\nthis criterion interesting, as we show here, is that it surprisingly displays\nbehavior similar to recent anomalies observed for non-locality measures in\nhigher dimensions, as well as demonstrates an equivalence to the CHSH\ninequality for certain classes of two-qubit states. Yet, despite these\nsimilarities, the criterion is not itself a non-locality measure. We also\nconsider entanglement detection in bound entangled states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2008 18:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-21"}

The linear part of the $\\dot{\\Phi}$ power\nspectrum (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect or ISW) drops quickly as the\nrelative importance of $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ diminishes at high redshift, while\nthe non-linear part (the Rees-Sciama effect or RS) evolves more slowly with\nredshift. Therefore, the deviation of the total power spectrum from linear\ntheory occurs at larger scales at higher redshifts. The deviation occurs at\n$k\\sim 0.1 $ $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0$. The cross-correlation power spectrum of\nthe density $\\delta$ with $\\dot{\\Phi}$ behaves differently to the power\nspectrum of $\\dot{\\Phi}$. Firstly, the deviation from linear theory occurs at\nsmaller scales ($k\\sim 1 $ $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0$). Secondly, the correlation\nbecomes negative when the non-linear effect dominates. For the\ncross-correlation power spectrum of galaxy samples with the CMB, the non-linear\neffect becomes significant at $l\\sim 500$ and rapidly makes the cross power\nspectrum negative. For high redshift samples, the cross-correlation is expected\nto be suppressed by $5-10%$ on arcminute scales. The RS effect makes a\nnegligible contribution to the large-scale ISW cross-correlation measurement.\nHowever, on arc-minute scales it will contaminate the expected\ncross-correlation signal induced by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2008 20:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2008 19:34:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2009 19:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The main, surprising\noutcome seems a QFT physically equivalent to the undeformed counterpart (to\nconfirm it or not one should however first clarify the relation between\n$n$-point functions and observables, in particular S-matrix elements).\n  These results are mainly based on a joint work [24] with J.

Field theories with infinitely many\nderivatives are ubiquitous in string field theory and have attracted interest\nrecently also from cosmologists. Crucial to any application is a firm\nunderstanding of the mathematical structure of infinite order partial\ndifferential equations. In our previous work we developed a formalism to study\nthe initial value problem for linear infinite order equations with constant\ncoefficients. Our approach relied on the use of a contour integral\nrepresentation for the functions under consideration. In many applications,\nincluding the study of cosmological perturbations in nonlocal inflation, one\nmust solve linearized partial differential equations about some time-dependent\nbackground. This typically leads to variable coefficient equations, in which\ncase the contour integral methods employed previously become inappropriate. In\nthis paper we develop the theory of a particular class of linear infinite order\npartial differential equations with variable coefficients. Our formalism is\nparticularly well suited to the types of equations that arise in nonlocal\ncosmological perturbation theory. As an example to illustrate our formalism we\ncompute the leading corrections to the scalar field perturbations in p-adic\ninflation and show explicitly that these are small on large scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2008 00:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

This has stimulated a\nnumber of recent research endeavors that aim to apply SDR to the high-order QAM\ncases. These independently developed SDRs are different in concept and\nstructure, and presently no serious analysis has been given to compare these\nmethods. This paper analyzes the relationship of three such SDR methods, namely\nthe polynomial-inspired SDR (PI-SDR) by Wiesel et al., the bound-constrained\nSDR (BC-SDR) by Sidiropoulos and Luo, and the virtually-antipodal SDR (VA-SDR)\nby Mao et al. The result that we have proven is somehow unexpected: the three\nSDRs are equivalent. Simply speaking, we show that solving any one SDR is\nequivalent to solving the other SDRs. This paper also discusses some\nimplications arising from the SDR equivalence, and provides simulation results\nto verify our theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2008 04:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Also, we\nshall mention that one of the advantages of this new methodology is its ability\nto capture nonlinear dynamics. For our purpose, we shall basically focus on the\nbehaviour of stock market indexes and consider the CAC 40, MIB 30, NIKKEI 225,\nPSI 20, IBEX 35, FTSE 100 and SP 500 for a comparative analysis between the\napproaches mentioned above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2008 09:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

In case of multimedia or\nmulticast communications and in the context of the Delay Tolerant Networking\n(DTN), the classical retransmission schemes can be counterproductive in terms\nof data transfer performance or not possible when the acknowledgment path is\nnot always available. Indeed, over long delay links, packets retransmission has\na meaning of cost and must be minimized.In this paper, we detail a novel\nreliability mechanism with an implicit acknowledgment strategy that could be\nused either within these new DTN proposals, for multimedia traffic or in the\ncontext of multicast transport protocols. This proposal is based on a new\non-the-fly erasure coding concept specifically designed to operate efficient\nreliable transfer over bi-directional links. This proposal, named Tetrys,\nallows to unify a full reliability with an error correction scheme. In this\npaper, we model the performance of this proposal and demonstrate with a\nprototype, that we can achieve a full reliability without acknowledgment path\nconfirmation. Indeed, the main findings are that Tetrys is not sensitive to the\nloss of acknowledgments while ensuring a faster data availability to the\napplication compared to other traditional acknowledgment schemes.

The composition of\nSmodels program modules is suitably limited by module conditions which ensure\nthe compatibility of the module system with stable models. Hence the semantics\nof an entire Smodels program depends directly on stable models assigned to its\nmodules. This result is formalized as a module theorem which truly strengthens\nLifschitz and Turner's splitting-set theorem for the class of Smodels programs.\nTo streamline generalizations in the future, the module theorem is first proved\nfor normal programs and then extended to cover Smodels programs using a\ntranslation from the latter class of programs to the former class. Moreover,\nthe respective notion of module-level equivalence, namely modular equivalence,\nis shown to be a proper congruence relation: it is preserved under\nsubstitutions of modules that are modularly equivalent.

The accuracy of the effective temperatures is supported\nby a number of independent consistency checks. The spectroscopic orbital\nsolution for TrES-3 is improved with our new radial-velocity measurements of\nthat system, as are the light-curve parameters for both systems based on newly\nacquired photometry for TrES-3 and a reanalysis of existing photometry for\nTrES-4.

The method is\nexact for full-sky coverage and uniform noise, and an excellent approximation\nfor sky cuts and scanning patterns relevant for modern satellite experiments\nsuch as WMAP and Planck. A single evaluation of this estimator between l=2 and\n200 takes ~0.2 CPU milliseconds, while for comparison, a single pixel space\nlikelihood evaluation between l=2 and 30 for a map with ~2500 pixels requires\n~20 seconds.

The Johnson filtration is a decreasing\nsequence of subgroups of the Torelli group of S, whose k-th term consists of\nthe self-homeomorphisms of S that act trivially at the level of the k-th\nnilpotent quotient of P. Morita defined a homomorphism from the k-th term of\nthe Johnson filtration to the third homology group of the k-th nilpotent\nquotient of P.

We\nprovide a diagrammatic description of the k-th infinitesimal Morita\nhomomorphism and, given an expansion of the free group P that is \"symplectic\"\nin some sense, we show how to compute it from Kawazumi's \"total Johnson map\".\nBesides, we give a topological interpretation of the full tree-reduction of the\nLMO homomorphism, which is a diagrammatic representation of the Torelli group\nderived from the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki invariant of 3-manifolds.

There have been many recent attempts at radiative\ntransfer in SPH (Stamatellos et al 2005, 2005, Mayer et al 2007, Whitehouse and\nBate 2006), however these are becoming increasingly complex, with some methods\nrequiring the photosphere to be mapped (which is often of non-trivial geometric\nshape), and extra conditions to be applied there (matching atmospheres as in\nCai et al (2008), or specifying cooling at the photosphere as in Mayer et al\n(2007)). The method of identifying the photosphere is usually a significant\naddition to the total simulation runtime, and often requires extra free\nparameters, the changing of which will affect the final results. Our method is\nnot affected by such concerns, as the photosphere is constructed implicitly by\nthe algorithm without the need for extra free parameters.
