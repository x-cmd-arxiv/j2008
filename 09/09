The set of fully general relativistic Navier-Stokes equations is\nsolved implicitly using the implicit solver GR-I-RMHD in combination with a\nthird order spatial and second order temporal advection scheme. The viscous\noperators are formulated using a Kerr-like metric in the fixed background of a\nslowly rotating neutron star whose radius coincides with the corresponding last\nstable orbit. The importance of these operators and their possible\nsimplifications are discussed as well. In the rotating case and depending on\nthe viscosity parameter, $\\alpha_\\mm{tur}$, it is found that the\nviscously-initiated fronts at the center of bursts propagate at much faster\nspeed than the fluid motion. These fast fronts act to decouple angular momentum\nfrom matter: angular momentum is transported outwards while matter sinks\ninwards into the deep gravitational well of the neutron star, thereby enhancing\nthe compression of matter necessary for initiating ignition, that subsequently\nspreads over the whole surface of the neutron star on the viscous time scale.\nBased on the numerical simulations, we find that a viscosity parameter\n$\\alpha_\\mm{tur} = \\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ is most suitable for fitting observations\nof neutron stars during X-ray bursts. It is argued that the spin up observed in\nthe cooling tails of X-ray bursts is a transient phase, which eventually should\nbe followed by a spin down phase. This delay can be attributed to a significant\nlengthening of the viscous time scale due to rapid cooling of matter in the\nouter layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2008 17:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Here, we explore various\nformulations of unimodular gravity beyond the classical limit. We first\nconsider the non-generally covariant action formulation in which the\ndeterminant of the metric is held fixed to unity. We argue that the\ncorresponding quantum theory is also equivalent to General Relativity for\nlocalized perturbative processes which take place in generic backgrounds of\ninfinite volume (such as asymptotically flat spacetimes). Next, using the same\naction, we calculate semiclassical non-perturbative quantities, which we expect\nwill be dominated by Euclidean instanton solutions. We derive the entropy/area\nratio for cosmological and black hole horizons, finding agreement with GR for\nsolutions in backgrounds of infinite volume, but disagreement for backgrounds\nwith finite volume. In deriving the above results, the path integral is taken\nover histories with fixed 4-volume. We point out that the results are different\nif we allow the 4-volume of the different histories to vary over a continuum\nrange. In this \"generalized\" version of unimodular gravity, one recovers the\nfull set of Einstein's equations in the classical limit, including the trace,\nso $\\Lambda$ is no longer an integration constant. Finally, we consider the\ngenerally covariant theory due to Henneaux and Teitelboim, which is classically\nequivalent to unimodular gravity.

Indeed, if the differences Delta J_L among the even\nzonals estimated in different Earth's gravity field global solutions from the\ndedicated GRACE mission are assumed for the uncertainties delta J_L instead of\nusing their covariance sigmas sigma_JL, it turns out that the systematic\nuncertainty \\delta\\mu in the Lense-Thirring test with the nodes Omega of LAGEOS\nand LAGEOS II may be up to 3 to 4 times larger than in the evaluations so far\npublished ($5-10%$) based on the use of the sigmas of one model at a time\nseparately. The second issue consists of the possibility of using a different\napproach in extracting the relativistic signature of interest from the\nLAGEOS-type data. The third issue is the possibility of reaching a realistic\ntotal accuracy of 1% with LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and LARES, which should be launched\nin November 2009 with a VEGA rocket. While LAGEOS and LAGEOS II fly at\naltitudes of about 6000 km, LARES will be likely placed at an altitude of 1450\nkm. Thus, it will be sensitive to much more even zonals than LAGEOS and LAGEOS\nII.

These new data provide a lower opacity tracer of\nmolecular clouds and improved angular and spectral resolution than previous\nsurveys of molecular line emission along the Galactic Plane. We calculate GMC\nmasses within the SRBY cloud boundaries assuming LTE conditions throughout the\ncloud and a constant H2 to 13CO abundance, while accounting for the variation\nof the 12C/13C with Galacto-centric radius. The LTE derived masses are\ntypically five times smaller than the SRBY virial masses. The corresponding\nmedian mass surface density of molecular hydrogen for this sample is 42\nMsun/pc^2, which is significantly lower than the value derived by SRBY (median\n206 Msun/pc^2) that has been widely adopted by most models of cloud evolution\nand star formation. This discrepancy arises from both the extrapolation by SRBY\nof velocity dispersion, size, and CO luminosity to the 1K antenna temperature\nisophote that likely overestimates the GMC masses and our assumption of\nconstant 13CO abundance over the projected area of each cloud. Owing to the\nuncertainty of molecular abundances in the envelopes of clouds, the mass\nsurface density of giant molecular clouds could be larger than the values\nderived from our 13CO measurements. From velocity dispersions derived from the\n13CO data, we find that the coefficient of the cloud structure functions,\nvo=sigma_v/R^{1/2}, is not constant, as required to satisfy Larson's scaling\nrelationships, but rather systematically varies with the surface density of the\ncloud as Sigma^{0.5} as expected for clouds in self-gravitational equlibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2008 18:15:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 18:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Jupiter forms via a combination of planetesimal accretion\nand gravitational accumulation of gas from the surrounding solar nebula. The\nformation of the circumjovian gaseous disk, or subnebula, straddles the\ntransitional stage between runaway gas accretion and Jupiter's eventual\nisolation from the solar disk. This isolation, which effectively signals the\ntermination of Jupiter's accretion, takes place as Jupiter opens a deep gas gap\nin the solar nebula, or the solar nebula gas dissipates. We describe the\nconditions for accretion of the Galilean satellites, including the timescales\nfor their formation, and mechanisms for their survival, all within the context\nof key constraints for satellite formation models. The environment in which the\nregular satellites form is tied to the timescale for circumplanetary disk\ndispersal, which depends on the nature and persistence of turbulence. In the\ncase that subnebula turbulence decays as gas inflow wanes, we present a novel\nmechanism for satellite survival involving gap opening by the largest\nsatellites. On the other hand, assuming that sustained turbulence drives\nsubnebula evolution on a short timescale compared to the satellite formation\ntimescale, we review a model that emphasizes collisional processes to explain\nsatellite observations.

Hence, the inversion result is\nnot directly related to the thermal structure. Next, using solar models that\ninclude magnetic fields, we develop a formulation to use the inversion results\nto infer the differences in the magnetic and thermal structures between active\nand quiet regions. We then apply our technique to existing structure inversion\nresults for different pairs of active and quiet regions.

We focus on the effects of FUV and\nX-ray photons since EUV photoevaporation has been treated previously, and\nconsider central star masses in the range $0.3-7 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. Contrary to\nthe EUV photoevaporation scenario, which creates a gap at about $r_g\\sim 7\\\n(M_*/1{\\rm M}_{\\odot})$ AU and then erodes the outer disk from inside out, we\nfind that FUV photoevaporation predominantly removes less bound gas from the\nouter disk. Heating by FUV photons can cause significant erosion of the outer\ndisk where most of the mass is typically located. X-rays indirectly increase\nthe mass loss rates (by a factor $\\sim 2$) by ionizing the gas, thereby\nreducing the positive charge on grains and PAHs and enhancing FUV-induced grain\nphotoelectric heating. FUV and X-ray photons may create a gap in the disk at\n$\\sim 10$ AU under favourable circumstances. Photoevaporation timescales for\nM$_* \\sim 1{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ stars are estimated to be $\\sim 10^6$ years, after\nthe onset of disk irradiation by FUV and X-rays. Disk lifetimes do not vary\nmuch for stellar masses in the range $0.3-3$M$_{\\odot}$. More massive stars\n($\\gtrsim 7 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$) lose their disks rapidly (in $\\sim 10^5$ years)\ndue to their high EUV and FUV fields. Disk lifetimes are shorter for shallow\nsurface density distributions and when the dust opacity in the disk is reduced\nby processes such as grain growth or settling. The latter suggests that the\nphotoevaporation process may accelerate as the dust disk evolves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 14:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Here, we consider all this available information to reconstruct the\nfull evolutionary history of the black hole X-ray binary XTE J1118+480,\nassuming that the system originated in the Galactic disk and the donor has\nsolar metallicity. This analysis accounts for four evolutionary phases: mass\ntransfer through the ongoing X-ray phase, tidal evolution before the onset of\nRoche-lobe overflow, motion through the Galactic potential after the formation\nof the black hole, and binary orbital dynamics due to explosive mass loss and\npossibly a black hole natal kick at the time of core collapse. We find that\nright after black hole formation, the system consists of a ~6.0-10.0 solar\nmasses black hole and a ~1.0-1.6 solar masses main-sequence star. We also find\nthat that an asymmetric natal kick is not only plausible but required for the\nformation of this system, and derive a lower and upper limit on the black hole\nnatal kick velocity magnitude of 80 km/s and 310 km/s, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 15:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
