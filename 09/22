This implies strict constraints on the possible models of\nnon-standard neutrino interactions, which we analyze. The focus is set on the\neffective low-energy dimension six and eight operators involving four leptons,\ndecomposing them according to all possible tree-level mediators, as a guide for\nmodel building. The new couplings are required to have sizeable strength, while\nprocesses involving four charged leptons are required to be suppressed. For\nnon-standard interactions in matter, only diagonal tau-neutrino interactions\ncan escape these requirements and can be allowed to result from dimension six\noperators. Large non-standard neutrino interactions from dimension eight\noperators alone are phenomenologically allowed in all flavour channels and\nshown to require at least two new mediator particles. The new couplings must\nobey general cancellation conditions both at the dimension six and eight\nlevels, which result from expressing the operators obtained from the mediator\nanalysis in terms of a complete basis of operators. We illustrate with one\nexample how to apply this information to model building.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2008 14:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2008 12:58:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2009 14:36:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2009 07:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-23"}

CGs are identified using the same 2D criteria as those\nvisually applied by Hickson (1982) to his CGs (HCGs), but with a brightest\ngalaxy magnitude limit, and the blending of close projected pairs. Half of the\nmock CGs identified in projection contain at least 4 accordant velocities\n(mvCGs), versus 70% for HCGs. In comparison to mvCGs, the HCGs are only 8%\ncomplete at distances < 9000 km/s, missing the CGs with small angular sizes, a\nstrongly dominant galaxy, and (for one SAM) the CGs that are fainter and those\nwith lower surface brightness. We explore different ways to determine the\nfraction of physically dense groups. Binding energy criteria turn out to be\ninapplicable given the segregation between galaxies and dark matter particles.\nWe rely instead on the combination of the 3D length of the CGs (maximum real\nspace galaxy separation) and their elongation along the line-of-sight (ratio of\nmaximum line-of-sight to maximum projected separations), restricting ourselves\nin both cases to smallest quartets within the CGs. We find that between 64% and\n80% (depending on the SAM) of the mvCGs have 3D lengths shorter than 200 kpc/h,\nbetween 71% and 80% have line-of-sight elongations less than 2, while between\n59% and 76% have either 3D lengths shorter than 100 kpc/h or both lengths\nshorter than 200 kpc/h and elongations smaller than 2. Therefore, chance\nalignments (CAs) of galaxies concern at most 40% of the mvCGs. These CAs are\nmostly produced from larger host groups, but a few have galaxies extending a\nfew Mpc beyond the host group. The mvCGs built with the Hickson selection with\n(without) the close projected pair blending criterion have 10% higher (lower)\nfractions of physically dense systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2008 15:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2010 17:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

We\nconcentrate on one such effect, ambipolar diffusion, which enables the field\nlines to slip relative to the bulk neutral matter. We find that the slippage\ndoes not sufficiently weaken the braking to allow rotationally supported disks\nto form for realistic levels of cloud magnetization and cosmic ray ionization\nrate; in some cases, the magnetic braking is even enhanced. Only in dense cores\nwith both exceptionally weak fields and unreasonably low ionization rate do\nsuch disks start to form in our simulations.

We show that a per session throughput capacity of\n$\\Theta(nT^{3}(n))$, where $n$ is the total number of nodes and T(n) is the\ncommunication range, can be achieved as a tight bound when each session\ncontains a constant number of sinks.

This result\nproves that NC does not contribute to the order capacity of multicast traffic\nin wireless ad hoc networks when MPR and MPT are used in the network.

Using Scanning tunneling microscopy and an initially vicinal\n6H-SiC(0001) sample, we determine the sequence of microscopic processes that\nresult in the formation of bilayer graphene. Adjacent steps retract with\ndifferent speeds and the carbon released produces characteristic \"fingers\" when\na step of higher speed catches up with a slower moving step. These processes\nare based on different rates of Si desorption from steps and can be avoided if\nfaster heating rates are used. We also show that faster rates lead to single\nlayer graphene films extending over many microns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2008 23:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-23"}

The evolution of these pulses follow soft-to-hard-to-soft (the\nphase of soft-to-hard and hard-to-soft are denoted by rise phase and decay\nphase, respectively) with time. It is found that the overall characteristics of\n$E_{peak}$ of our selected sample are: 1) the $E_{peak}$ evolution in the rise\nphase always start on the high state (the values of $E_{peak}$ are always\nhigher than 50 keV); 2) the spectra of rise phase clearly start at higher\nenergy (the median of $E_{peak}$ are about 300 keV), whereas the spectra of\ndecay phase end at much lower energy (the median of $E_{peak}$ are about 200\nkeV); 3) the spectra of rise phase are harder than that of the decay phase and\nthe duration of rise phase are much shorter than that of decay phase as well.\nIn other words, for a complete pulse the initial $E_{peak}$ is higher than the\nfinal $E_{peak}$ and the duration of initial phase (rise phase) are much\nshorter than the final phase (decay phase).

Consider $2n$ teams in a\nsport league. Each pair of teams must play exactly one match in $2n-1$ days.\nThat is, $n$ games are held simultaneously in a day. We want to make a schedule\nwhich has $n(2n-1)$ games for $2n-1$ days.\n  When we make a schedule, the schedule must satisfy a constraint according to\nthe HAP table, which designates a home game or an away game for each team and\neach date. Two teams cannot play against each other unless one team is assigned\nto a home game and the other team is assigned to an away game. Recently, D.\nBriskorn proposed a necessary condition for a HAP table to have a proper\nschedule. And he proposed a conjecture that such a condition is also\nsufficient. That is, if a solution to the linear inequalities exists, they must\nhave an integral solution. In this paper, we rewrite his conjecture by using\nperfect matchings. We consider a monoid in the affine space generated by\nperfect matchings. In terms of the Hilbert basis of such a monoid, the problem\nis naturally generalized to a scheduling problem for not all pairs of teams\ndescribed by a regular graph.

The liner consists\nof a ceramic structure of parallel square channels: 1mm by 1 mm in cross\nsection, 65 mm in length, and a surface density of 400 channels/inch square.\nThe channels are rigidly terminated, thus constituting a locally reacting\nstructure. In the absence of flow the liner reacts classically: There is a\nsignificant decrease in transmission coefficient around the frequency of\nminimal impedance. When the wall is exposed to a grazing flow this behaviour is\nchanged: an increase in transmission coefficient appears at this resonance\nfrequency. The transmission coefficient can be even rise above 1 (up to 3 for a\nMach number of 0.3). This behaviour is caused by the appearance of a\nhydrodynamic instability above the liner. Furthermore, the stationary pressure\ndrop induced by this liner is deeply affected by its acoustic behaviour. When a\nsound wave is added, at the resonance frequency of the liner, the pressure drop\ncan increase by a factor 3 when the Mach number is 0.3.

Extracted\nvalues of spin polarization, which are close to the spin polarization of Fe,\nreveal no variation with the rare earth component for the measured\nintermetallic compounds. This suggests that using this technique we probe the\nFe sub-lattice, and that this lattice drives spintronic effects in these\ncompounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2008 15:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 16:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-06"}

The class of alpha-critical graphs has several\nnice structural properties, most of them related to their defect which is the\nnumber of vertices minus two times the stability number. In particular, a\nremarkable result of Lov\\'asz (1978) is the finite basis theorem for\nalpha-critical graphs of a fixed defect. The class of alpha-critical graphs is\nalso of interest for at least two topics of polyhedral studies. First,\nChv\\'atal (1975) shows that each alpha-critical graph induces a rank inequality\nwhich is facet-defining for its stable set polytope. Investigating a weighted\ngeneralization, Lipt\\'ak and Lov\\'asz (2000, 2001) introduce critical\nfacet-graphs (which again produce facet-defining inequalities for their stable\nset polytopes) and they establish a finite basis theorem. Second, Koppen (1995)\ndescribes a construction that delivers from any alpha-critical graph a\nfacet-defining inequality for the linear ordering polytope. Doignon, Fiorini\nand Joret (2006) handle the weighted case and thus define facet-defining\ngraphs. Here we investigate relationships between the two weighted\ngeneralizations of alpha-critical graphs. We show that facet-defining graphs\n(for the linear ordering polytope) are obtainable from 1-critical facet-graphs\n(linked with stable set polytopes). We then use this connection to derive\nvarious results on facet-defining graphs, the most prominent one being derived\nfrom Lipt\\'ak and Lov\\'asz's finite basis theorem for critical facet-graphs. At\nthe end of the paper we offer an alternative proof of Lov\\'asz's finite basis\ntheorem for alpha-critical graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2008 15:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-15"}

This perturbation in the form of a rotation\nnot only creates a three-dimensional chaotic mixing region, which operates\nthrough the stretching and folding of material lines, but also offers the\npossibility of controlling both the size and the location of the mixing.

Most of this\nwork has focused on the finite-dimensional setting in which the goal is to\ndecompose a finite-length vector into a given finite dictionary. Underlying\nmany of these results is the conceptual notion of an uncertainty principle: a\nsignal cannot be sparsely represented in two different bases. Here, we extend\nthese ideas and results to the analog, infinite-dimensional setting by\nconsidering signals that lie in a finitely-generated shift-invariant (SI)\nspace. This class of signals is rich enough to include many interesting special\ncases such as multiband signals and splines. By adapting the notion of\ncoherence defined for finite dictionaries to infinite SI representations, we\ndevelop an uncertainty principle similar in spirit to its finite counterpart.\nWe demonstrate tightness of our bound by considering a bandlimited lowpass\ntrain that achieves the uncertainty principle. Building upon these results and\nsimilar work in the finite setting, we show how to find a sparse decomposition\nin an overcomplete dictionary by solving a convex optimization problem. The\ndistinguishing feature of our approach is the fact that even though the problem\nis defined over an infinite domain with infinitely many variables and\nconstraints, under certain conditions on the dictionary spectrum our algorithm\ncan find the sparsest representation by solving a finite-dimensional problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2008 15:54:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 20:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
