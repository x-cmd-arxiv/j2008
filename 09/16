Second, while the\ninfrared and mm-regimes are thought to be related based on reported time lags\nbetween lightcurves from the two wavelength domains, the reported time lag of\n20 min inferred using the Keck data of this common VLT/Keck night only is at\nodds with the lag of ~100 min reported earlier.

The AGN is clearly\ndetected at a level of about 2 x 10^{-17} W m^{-2} in the observed 0.3-10.0 keV\nband by Swift in a 50 ks observation in 2007 September. For the first time\nsince the ROSAT All-Sky Survey observation in 1990 it was possible to derive an\nX-ray photon distribution by adding together all Swift observations that have\nbeen performed so far (85.5 ks in total). This photon distribution is\nconsistent with an X-ray spectrum of an AGN with a partial covering absorber\nwith a column density in the order of ~ 1 x 10^{23} cm^{-2} and a covering\nfraction of about 90%.

The typical double-peaked CaII 8498,8542,8662A\nemission lines can be modelled in terms of a Keplerian gas disc with a radial\nextent from ~0.5Rsun to ~1.0. The effective temperature of SDSS0845+2257,\nTeff=18600+-500K, is comparable to the two other white dwarfs with gaseous\ndiscs, SDSS1043+0855 and SDSS1228+1040, and hence substantially hotter than the\nbulk of white dwarfs where dusty debris discs were identified through the\npresence of infrared excess flux. This may suggest that the conditions to\nproduce emission lines from debris discs in the optical wavelength range are\nonly met for a relatively narrow range in Teff. The observed asymmetry in the\nline profiles indicates a substantial eccentricity in the disc. Two spectra\nobtained four years apart reveal a significant change in the shapes and\nequivalent widths of the line profiles, implying that the circumstellar disc\nevolves on relatively short time scales. In contrast to SDSS1043+0855 and\nSDSS1228+1040, SDSS0845+2257 has a helium-dominated atmosphere. We detect\nphotospheric absorption lines of He, Ca, Mg, and Si in the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey spectrum, and hence classify SDSS0845+2257 as DBZ white dwarf.

However,\nthis seems to suggest a rethink of our standard notions of cosmological\nevolution after the end of inflation and before the beginning of BBN. We argue\nthat within classes of realistic string compactifications, there generically\nexists a light modulus with a mass comparable to that of the gravitino which\ngenerates a large late-time entropy when it decays. Therefore, all known\nmechanisms of generating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe in the literature\nhave to take this fact into account. In this work, we find that it is still\npossible to naturally generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe as\nwell as light left-handed neutrino masses from a period of Affleck-Dine(AD)\nleptogenesis shortly after the end of inflation, in classes of realistic string\nconstructions with a minimal extension of the MSSM below the unification scale\n(consisting only of right-handed neutrinos) and satisfying certain microscopic\ncriteria described in the text. The consequences are as follows. The lightest\nleft-handed neutrino is required to be virtually massless. The moduli\n(gravitino) problem can be naturally solved in this framework both within\ngravity and gauge mediation. The observed upper bound on the relic abundance\nconstrains the moduli-matter and moduli-gravitino couplings since the DM is\nproduced non-thermally within this framework. Finally, although not a definite\nprediction, the framework naturally allows a light right-handed neutrino and\nsneutrinos around the electroweak scale which could have important implications\nfor DM as well as the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2008 20:13:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2009 03:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 17:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-16"}

This geometric approach leads to\nremarkable examples, such as perfect space-time block codes, for which the\ncomplexity of Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding is considerable. Code diversity\nis an alternative and complementary approach where a small number of feedback\nbits are used to select from a family of space-time codes. Different codes lead\nto different induced channels at the receiver, where Channel State Information\n(CSI) is used to instruct the transmitter how to choose the code. This method\nof feedback provides gains associated with beamforming while minimizing the\nnumber of feedback bits. It complements the standard approach to code design by\ntaking advantage of different (possibly equivalent) realizations of a\nparticular code design. Feedback can be combined with sub-optimal low\ncomplexity decoding of the component codes to match ML decoding performance of\nany individual code in the family. It can also be combined with ML decoding of\nthe component codes to improve performance beyond ML decoding performance of\nany individual code. One method of implementing code diversity is the use of\nfeedback to adapt the phase of a transmitted signal as shown for 4 by 4\nQuasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code (QOSTBC) and multi-user detection using\nthe Alamouti code. Code diversity implemented by selecting from equivalent\nvariants is used to improve ML decoding performance of the Golden code.

The energy band structure of zigzag ribbons has two\nvalleys that are well separated in momentum space, related to the two Dirac\npoints of the graphene spectrum. The partial flat bands due to edge states make\nthe imbalance between left- and right-going modes in each valley, {\\it i.e.}\nappearance of a single chiral mode. This feature gives rise to a perfectly\nconducting channel in the disordered system, i.e. the average of conductance\n$<g>$ converges exponentially to 1 conductance quantum per spin with increasing\nsystem length, provided impurity scattering does not connect the two valleys,\nas is the case for long-range impurity potentials. Ribbons with short-range\nimpurity potentials, however, through inter-valley scattering, display ordinary\nlocalization behavior. Symmetry considerations lead to the classification of\ndisordered zigzag ribbons into the unitary class for long-range impurities, and\nthe orthogonal class for short-range impurities. The electronic states of\ngraphene nanoribbons with general edge structures are also discussed, and it is\ndemonstrated that chiral channels due to the edge states are realized even in\nmore general edge structures except for armchair edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2008 07:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-07"}

We find that both star-forming\n(sBzK) and passive (pBzK) galaxies, to a magnitude limit of $K_{AB} < 23$, are\nstrongly clustered. The passive galaxies are the most strongly clustered\npopulation, with scale lengths of $r_0 = 15.0^{+1.9}_{-2.2}$h$^{-1}$Mpc\ncompared with $r_0 = 6.75^{+0.34}_{-0.37}$h$^{-1}$Mpc for star-forming\ngalaxies.

In addition, the pBzKs exhibit a\nsharp flattening and potential turn-over in their number counts, in agreement\nwith other recent studies.

We indeed consider the\ndifferent tasks of the data integration process as services offered by agents.\nTo validate this approach, we have actually developed an MAS for complex data\nintegration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2008 11:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-17"}

The 3:2 HFQPO pairs are interpreted by virtue of the inner\nand outer hotspots arising from non-axisymmetric magnetic field, where the\ninner hotspot is produced by a torque exerted at the inner edge of the disc,\nand the outer hotspot is created by the screw instability of the large-scale\nmagnetic field. The very steep emissivity index is created predominantly by the\ntorque exerted at the inner edge of the disc.

The article presents data about many kinds\nof cyclic permutations of elements of the genetic code in the genetic\n(8x8)-matrix [C A; U G](3) of 64 triplets, where C, A, U, G are letters of the\ngenetic alphabet. These cyclic permutations lead to such reorganizations of the\nmatrix form of presentation of the initial genetic Yin-Yang-algebra that arisen\nmatrices serve as matrix forms of presentations of new Yin-Yang-algebras as\nwell. They are connected algorithmically with Hadamard matrices. The discovered\nexistence of a hierarchy of the cyclic changes of types of genetic\nYin-Yang-algebras allows thinking about new algebraic-genetic models of cyclic\nprocesses in inherited biological systems including models of cyclic\nmetamorphoses of animals. These cycles of changes of the genetic 8-dimensional\nalgebras and of their 8-dimensional numeric systems have many analogies with\nfamous facts and doctrines of modern and ancient physiology, medicine, etc.\nThis viewpoint proposes that the famous idea by Pythagoras (about organization\nof natural systems in accordance with harmony of numerical systems) should be\ncombined with the idea of cyclic changes of Yin-Yang-numeric systems in\nconsidered cases.

From such algebraic-genetic viewpoint, the notion of\nbiological time can be considered as a factor of coordinating these\nhierarchical ensembles of cyclic changes of types of the genetic\nmulti-dimensional algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2008 14:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-17"}

Jupiter's strong burst emission is used to perform\nbroadband full signal cross-correlations on time intervals of up to hundreds of\nmilliseconds. METHODS: Broadband VLBI observations at about 20 MHz on a\nbaseline of ~50000 wavelengths were performed to achieve arcsecond angular\nresolution. LOFAR's Initial Test Station (LOFAR/ITS, The Netherlands) and the\nNancay Decametric Array (NDA, France) digitize the measured electric field with\n12 bit and 14 bit in a 40 MHz baseband. The fine structure in Jupiter's signal\nwas used for data synchronization prior to correlation on the time-series data.\nRESULTS: Strong emission from Jupiter was detected during snapshots of a few\nseconds and detailed features down to microsecond time-scales were identified\nin dynamic spectra. Correlations of Jupiter's burst emission returned strong\nfringes on 1 ms time-scales over channels as narrow as a hundred kilohertz\nbandwidth.

Therefore, we study\nthe geometry of the air shower radio emission measured with LOPES and search\nfor systematic effects between the direction determined on the radio signal and\nthe direction provided by the particle detector array KASCADE. METHODS: We\nproduce 4D radio images on time-scales of nanoseconds using digital\nbeam-forming. Each pixel of the image is calculated for three spatial\ndimensions and as a function of time. The third spatial dimension is obtained\nby calculating the beam focus for a range of curvature radii fitted to the\nsignal wave front. We search this multi-dimensional parameter space for the\ndirection of maximum coherence of the air shower radio signal and compare it to\nthe direction provided by KASCADE. RESULTS: The maximum radio emission of air\nshowers is obtained for curvature radii being larger than 3 km. We find that\nthe direction of the emission maximum can change when optimizing the curvature\nradius. Furthermore, we find a tentative increase of the curvature radius to\nlower elevations, where the air showers pass through a larger atmospheric\ndepth. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the angular resolution of LOPES is\nsufficient to determine the direction which maximizes the observed electric\nfield amplitude. However, the statistical uncertainty of the directions is not\ndetermined by the resolution of LOPES, but by the uncertainty of the curvature\nradius. We do not find any systematic deviation between the directions\ndetermined from the radio signal and from the detected particles.
