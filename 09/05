This solution is similar in form to that derived\nfrom Newtonian mechanics, and includes first-order corrections describing three\neffects due to general relativity: precession; reduced radial coordinate; and\nincreased eccentricity. The quantitative prediction of increased eccentricity\nmay provide an additional observational test of general relativity. By analogy\nwith Keplerian orbits, approximate orbital energy parameters are defined in\nterms of a relativistic eccentricity, providing first-order corrections to\nNewtonian energies for elliptical orbits. The first-order relativistic equation\nof orbit is demonstrated to be a limiting case of a very accurate\nself-consistent solution. This self-consistent solution is supported by exact\nnumerical solutions to the Schwarzschild geometry, displaying remarkable\nagreement. A more detailed energy parameterization is investigated using the\nrelativistic eccentricity together with the apsides derived from the\nrelativistic effective potential in support of the approximate energy\nparameters defined using only first-order corrections. The methods and\napproximations describing this Keplerian limit are applied to more general\nstatic spherically-symmetric geometries.

The GaAs/AlGaAs\nheterostructure devices consist of two constrictions defined by etch trenches\nin 2D electron layer, enclosing an approximately circular island. Front gates\ndeposited in etch trenches allow to fine-tune the device for symmetry and to\nchange the constriction filling, relative to the bulk. The low-field\nlongitudinal and Hall magnetotransport shows Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and\ninteger quantum Hall plateaus. A systematic variation of front-gate voltage\naffects the constriction and the island electron density, while the bulk\ndensity remains unaffected. This results in quantized plateaus in longitudinal\nresistance, while the Hall resistance is dominated by the low-density,\nlow-filling constriction.

The present work devises an alternative to the mixing length\ntheory or turbulence models usually adopted for the modelling of convective\ntransport in such studies. Assuming that the largest convective patterns\ngenerate the majority of convective transport, the convective velocity field is\ndescribed using two parallel radial columns to represent up- and downstream\nflows. Horizontal exchange in the form of fluid flow and radiation over their\nconnecting interface couples the two columns and allows a simple circulating\nmotion. The main parameters of this convective description have a\nstraightforward geometrical meaning, namely the diameter of the columns\n(corresponding to the size of the convective cells) and the ratio of cross\nsection between up- and downdrafts. For this geometrical setup, the\ntime-dependent solution of the equations of radiation hydrodynamics is computed\nfrom an implicit scheme which has the advantage of being not affected by the\nCourant-Friedrichs-Lewy time step limit. In order to demonstrate the approach,\nresults for the example of convection zones in Cepheids are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 17:31:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2008 14:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this process we have\nidentified for the first time several new types of Cepheid pulsational\nbehaviour. We have found two triple-mode Cepheids pulsating simultaneously in\nthe first three radial overtones. In 9% of the first overtone Cepheids we have\ndetected weak, but well resolved secondary periodicities. They appear either\nvery close to the primary pulsation frequency or at a much higher frequency\nwith a characteristic period ratio of 0.60-0.64. In either case, the secondary\nperiodicities must correspond to nonradial modes of oscillation. This result\npresents a major challenge to the theory of stellar pulsations, which predicts\nthat such modes should not be exited in Cepheid variables. Nonradial modes have\nalso been found in three of the fundamental/first overtone double-mode\nCepheids, but no such oscillations have been detected in single mode Cepheids\npulsating in the fundamental mode. In 19% of double-mode Cepheids pulsating in\nthe first two radial overtones (FO/SO type) we have detected a Blazhko-type\nperiodic modulation of amplitudes and phases. Both modes are modulated with a\ncommon period, which is always longer than 700 days. Variations of the two\namplitudes are anticorrelated and maximum of one amplitude always coincides\nwith minimum of the other. We have compared observations of modulated FO/SO\nCepheids with predictions of theoretical models of the Blazhko effect, showing\nthat currently most popular models cannot account for properties of these\nstars. We propose that Blazhko effect in FO/SO Cepheids can be explained by a\nnonstationary resonant interaction of one of the radial modes with another,\nperhaps nonradial, mode of oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 17:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For this method, it is necessary to know the inclination of the\nX-ray-producing inner region of the disk. Since the inner disk is expected to\nbe oriented perpendicular to the spin axis of the hole, the usual practice is\nto assume that the black hole spin is aligned with the orbital angular momentum\nvector of the binary, and to estimate the inclination of the latter from\nellipsoidal modulations in the light curve of the secondary star. We show that\nthe inclination of the disk can be inferred directly if we have both spectral\nand polarization information on the disk radiation. The predicted degree of\npolarization varies from 0% to 5% as the disk inclination changes from face-on\nto edge-on. With current X-ray polarimetric techniques the polarization degree\nof a typical bright X-ray binary could be measured to an accuracy of 0.1% by\nobserving the source for about 10 days. Such a measurement would constrain the\ndisk inclination to within a degree or two and would significantly improve the\nreliability of black hole spin estimates. In addition, it would provide new\ninformation on the tilt between the black hole spin axis and the orbital\nrotation axis of the binary, which would constrain any velocity kicks\nexperienced by stellar-mass black holes during their formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 18:49:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2008 16:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We find that\nthe 3_1 and 4_1-TPK lengths are typically Delta l~4.7 nm and 6.9 nm,\nrespectively, for a wide range of tensions (F < 1.5 nN), pointing to a pore\ndiameter of ~2 nm below which a translocated knotted protein might get stuck.\nThe 4_1-knot length is in agreement with recent AFM pulling experiments.\nDetailed TPK characteristics however, may be sequence-specific: we find a\ndifferent size and structural behavior in polyglycines, and, strikingly, a\nstrong hydrogen bonding and water molecule trapping capability of hydrophobic\nTPKs due to side chain shielding of the polar TPK core.

The central idea is to utilize polynomial\nfitting schemes to approximate the thermodynamic integration data to improve\nthe accuracy and precision of the free energy difference estimates. In this\nreport we introduce polynomial and spline interpolation techniques. Two systems\nwith analytically solvable relative free energies are used to test the accuracy\nand precision of the interpolation approach (Shyu and Ytreberg, J Comput Chem\n30: 2297-2304, 2009). We also use both interpolation and extrapolation methods\nto determine a small molecule salvation free energy. Our simulations show that,\nusing such polynomial techniques and non-equidistant lambda values, the\nsolvation free energy can be estimated with high accuracy without using\nsoft-core scaling and separate simulations for Lennard-Jones and partial\ncharges.

Information graphics and\ninteractive information visualization systems employ a variety of metaphorical\ndevices to make abstract, complex, voluminous, or otherwise\ndifficult-to-comprehend information understandable in graphical terms. This\npaper explores the use of metaphor in information visualization, advancing the\ntheory previously argued by Johnson, Lakoff, Tversky et al. that many\ninformation graphics are metaphorically understood in terms of cognitively\nentrenched spatial patterns known as image schemas. These patterns serve to\nstructure and constrain abstract reasoning processes via metaphorical\nprojection operations that are grounded in everyday perceptual experiences with\nphenomena such as containment, movement, and force dynamics. Building on\nprevious research, I argue that information graphics promote comprehension of\ntheir target information through the use of graphical patterns that invoke\nthese preexisting schematic structures. I further theorize that the degree of\nstructural alignment of a particular graphic with one or more corresponding\nimage schemas accounts for its perceived degree of intuitiveness. Accordingly,\nimage schema theory can provide a powerful explanatory and predictive framework\nfor visualization research. I review relevant theories of analogy and metaphor,\nand discuss the image schematic properties of several common types of\ninformation graphic. I conclude with the proposal that the inventory of image\nschemas culled from linguistic studies can serve as the basis for an inventory\nof design elements suitable for developing intuitive and effective new\ninformation visualization techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 19:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

It could easily induce a crash of the photosynthetic-based food\nchain in the oceans. Regularities in the latitudinal distribution of damage are\napparent in simulations of the atmospheric changes. We previously proposed that\nthe late Ordovician extinction is a plausible candidate for a contribution from\nan ionizing radiation event, based on environmental selectivity in trilobites.\nTo test a null hypothesis based on this proposal, we confront latitudinal\ndifferential extinction rates predicted from the simulations with data from a\npublished analysis of latitudinal gradients in the Ordovician extinction.

Both the temperature and flux of the thermal emission\nshow a well defined temporal behavior, a broken power law in time. The\ntemperature is nearly constant during the first few seconds, afterwards it\ndecays with power law index alpha ~0.7. The thermal flux also decays at late\ntimes as a power law with index beta ~2.1. This behavior is very ubiquitous,\nand was observed in a sample currently containing 32 BATSE bursts. These\nresults are naturally explained by considering emission from the photosphere.\nThe photosphere of a relativistically expanding plasma wind strongly depends on\nthe angle to the line of sight, theta. As a result, thermal emission can be\nseen after tens of seconds. By introducing probability density function\nP(r,theta) of a thermal photon to escape the plasma at radius r and angle\ntheta, the late time behavior of the flux can be reproduced analytically.\nDuring the propagation below the photosphere, thermal photons lose energy as a\nresult of the slight misalignment of the scattering electrons velocity vectors,\nwhich leads to photon comoving energy decay epsilon'(r)~r^{-2/3}. This in turn\ncan explain the decay of the temperature observed at late times. Finally, I\nshow that understanding the thermal emission is essential in understanding the\nhigh energy, non-thermal spectra. Moreover, thermal emission can be used to\ndirectly measure the Lorentz factor of the flow and the initial jet radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 20:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Traditional random graph models are insufficient to handle such\nsituations.\n  A simple idea to account for multiple constraints consists in taking the\nintersection of random graphs. In this paper we initiate the study of random\ngraphs so obtained through a simple example. We examine the intersection of an\nErdos-Renyi graph and of one-dimensional geometric random graphs. We\ninvestigate the zero-one laws for the property that there are no isolated\nnodes. When the geometric component is defined on the unit circle, a full\nzero-one law is established and we determine its critical scaling. When the\ngeometric component lies in the unit interval, there is a gap in that the\nobtained zero and one laws are found to express deviations from different\ncritical scalings. In particular, the first moment method requires a larger\ncritical scaling than in the unit circle case in order to obtain the one law.\nThis discrepancy is somewhat surprising given that the zero-one laws for the\nabsence of isolated nodes are identical in the geometric random graphs on both\nthe unit interval and unit circle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 21:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-10"}

The unifying thread running through the\npapers is the use of Bayesian Inference to solve underdetermined inverse\nproblems in astrophysics. Firstly, a methodology is developed to solve a\nquestion in gravitational lens inversion - using the observed images of\ngravitational lens systems to reconstruct the undistorted source profile and\nthe mass profile of the lensing galaxy. A similar technique is also applied to\nthe task of inferring the number and frequency of modes of oscillation of a\nstar from the time series observations that are used in the field of\nasteroseismology. For these complex problems, many of the required calculations\ncannot be done analytically, and so Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms have\nbeen used. Finally, probabilistic reasoning is applied to a controversial\nquestion in astrobiology: does the fact that life formed quite soon after the\nEarth constitute evidence that the formation of life is quite probable, given\nthe right macroscopic conditions?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 01:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-08"}

We\ninvestigate the propagation of the brightening of these PFLs along the neutral\nlines and the separation of the FRs perpendicular to the neutral lines. In most\nof the cases, the length of the FRs ranges from 20 Mm to 170 Mm. The\npropagating duration of the brightening is from 10 to 60 minutes, and from 10\nminutes to 70 minutes for the separating duration of the FRs. The velocities of\nthe propagation and the separation range from 3 km/s to 39 km/s and 3 km/s to\n15 km/s, respectively. Both of the propagating velocities and the separating\nvelocities are associated with the flare strength and the length of the FRs. It\nappears that the propagation and the separation are dynamically coupled, that\nis the greater the propagating velocity is, the faster the separation is.\nFurthermore, a greater propagating velocity corresponds to a greater\ndeceleration (or acceleration). These PFLs display three types of propagating\npatterns. Type I propagation, which possesses about half of all the events, is\nthat the brightening begins at the middle part of a set of PFLs, and propagates\nbi-directionally towards its both ends. Type II, possessing 30%, is that the\nbrightening firstly appears at one end of a set of PFLs, then propagates to the\nother end. The remnant belongs to Type III propagation which displays that the\ninitial brightening takes place at two (or more than two) positions on two (or\nmore than two) sets of PFLs, and each brightening propagates bi-directionally\nalong the neutral line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 05:56:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2008 02:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Our analysis represents the widest and\ndeepest UV investigation of a nearby cluster of galaxies made to date. The Coma\nUV LFs show a faint-end slope steeper than the one observed in the local field.\nThis difference, more evident in NUV, is entirely due to the contribution of\nmassive quiescent systems (e.g. ellipticals, lenticulars and passive spirals),\nmore frequent in high density environments. On the contrary, the shape of the\nUV LFs for Coma star-forming galaxies does not appear to be significantly\ndifferent from that of the field, consistently with previous studies of local\nand high redshift clusters. We demonstrate that such similarity is only a\nselection effect, not providing any information on the role of the environment\non the star formation history of cluster galaxies. By integrating the UV LFs\nfor star-forming galaxies (corrected for the first time for internal dust\nattenuation), we show that the specific star formation rate of Coma is\nsignificantly lower than the integrated SSFR of the field and that Coma-like\nclusters contribute only <7% of the total SFR density of the local universe.\nApproximately 2/3 of the whole star-formation in Coma is occurring in galaxies\nwith M_star < 10^10 M_sol.

Other studies proposed that the carriers are a restricted\npopulation made of neutral and singly-ionised dehydrogenated coronene molecules\n(C24Hn, n less than 3), in line with models of the hydrogenation state of\ninterstellar PAHs predicting that medium-sized species are highly\ndehydrogenated. To assess the observational consequences of the latter\nhypothesis we have undertaken a systematic study of the electronic spectra of\ndehydrogenated PAHs. We use our first results to see whether such spectra show\nstrong general trends upon dehydrogenation. We used state-of-the-art techniques\nin the framework of the density functional theory (DFT) to obtain the\nelectronic ground-state geometries, and of the time- dependent DFT to evaluate\nthe electronic excited-state properties. We computed the absorption\ncross-section of the species C24Hn (n=12,10,8,6,4,2,0) in their neutral and\ncationic charge-states. Similar calculations were performed for other PAHs and\ntheir fullydehydrogenated counterparts. pi electron energies are always found\nto be strongly affected by dehydrogenation. In all cases we examined,\nprogressive dehydrogenation translates into a correspondingly progressive blue\nshift of the main electronic transitions. In particular, the pi-pi* collective\nresonance becomes broader and bluer with dehydrogenation. Its calculated energy\nposition is therefore predicted to fall in the gap between the UV bump and the\nfar-UV rise of the extinction curve. Since this effect appears to be\nsystematic, it poses a tight observational limit on the column density of\nstrongly dehydrogenated medium-sized PAHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 09:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The nine sources were selected because of some\npeculiar properties, such as extremely red infrared colours or too strong\nHalpha emission for their blue optical colours. Methods: We took high-quality,\nlow-resolution spectroscopy (R ~ 500) of the nine targets with ALFOSC at the\nNordic Optical Telescope. We also re-analyzed [24]-band photometry from\nMIPS/Spitzer and compiled the best photometry available at the ViJHKs passbands\nand the four IRAC/Spitzer channels for constructing accurate spectral energy\ndistributions covering from 0.55 to 24 mum. Results: The nine targets were\nclassified into: one Herbig Ae/Be star with a scatterer edge-on disc, two\nG-type stars, one X-ray flaring, early-M, young star with chromospheric Halpha\nemission, one very low-mass, accreting, young spectroscopic binary, two young\nobjects at the brown dwarf boundary with the characteristics of classical T\nTauri stars, and two emission-line galaxies, one undergoing star formation, and\nanother one whose spectral energy distribution is dominated by an active\ngalactic nucleus.

By using this effect, there is a\npossibility to determine the axis of rotation for each black hole formed,\nsuggesting a way to improve the statistics. Deviation from thermal spectrum is\nalso a signature of rotation. This deviation is due to the fact that rapidly\nrotating holes have an effective temperature $T_{\\rm eff}$ significantly higher\nthan the Hawking temperature $T_H$. The deformation of the spectral shape\nbecomes evident only for very rapidly rotating cases.

Based on\nthese results, we construct a phenomenological model which incorporates the\nstatistical and dynamical features of the translocation process and predicts a\npower law dependence of the translocation time on the polymer length with an\nexponent $\\alpha$ $\\approx 1.2$. The actual value of the exponent from the\nsimulations is $\\alpha = 1.28 \\pm 0.01$, which is in excellent agreement with\nexperimental measurements of DNA translocation through a nanopore, and is not\nsensitive to the choice of parameters in the simulation. The mechanism behind\nthe emergence of such a robust exponent is related to the interplay between the\nlongitudinal and transversal dynamics of both translocated and untranslocated\nsegments.

Specifically, bit errors\nare caused by erroneous decoding at the receiver or violation of the strict\ndelay constraint. Under certain scaling of the statistics of the bit-arrival\nprocess with SNR, this paper shows that the optimal decay behavior of the\nasymptotic total probability of bit error depends on how fast the burstiness of\nthe source scales down with SNR. If the source burstiness scales down too\nslowly, the total probability of error is asymptotically dominated by\ndelay-violation events. On the other hand, if the source burstiness scales down\ntoo quickly, the total probability of error is asymptotically dominated by\nchannel-error events. However, at the proper scaling, where the burstiness\nscales linearly with 1/sqrt(log SNR) and at the optimal coding duration and\ntransmission rate, the occurrences of channel errors and delay-violation errors\nare asymptotically balanced. In this latter case, the optimal exponent of the\ntotal probability of error reveals a tradeoff that addresses the question of\nhow much of the allowable time and rate should be used for gaining reliability\nover the channel and how much for accommodating the burstiness with delay\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 15:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

An example is the case of high\ntemperature superconductors: while a tight-binding model captures the kinetic\nterm, it is not clear that there is superconductivity with only an onsite\nrepulsion and, thus, that the problem is accurately described by the Hubbard\nmodel alone. Here we pose the question of whether, once the kinetic energy is\nfixed, a candidate ground state is {\\it groundstatable or not}. The easiness to\nanswer this question is strongly related to the presence or the absence of a\nsign problem in the system.

Its aim is threefold.\nUpon starting from the multi-dimensional Markovian state transition model\nproposed by Malone \\textit{et.al.} for characterizing the behavior of the IEEE\n802.11 protocol at the Medium Access Control layer, it presents an extension\naccounting for packet transmission failures due to channel errors. Second, it\nestablishes the conditions under which a network constituted by $N$ stations,\neach station transmitting with its own bit rate, $R^{(s)}_d$, and packet rate,\n$\\lambda_s$, can be assumed loaded. Finally, it proposes a modified\nProportional Fairness (PF) criterion, suitable for mitigating the \\textit{rate\nanomaly} problem of multirate loaded IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs, employing the\nmandatory DCF option. Compared to the widely adopted assumption of saturated\nnetwork, the proposed fairness criterion can be applied to general loaded\nnetworks.\n  The throughput allocation resulting from the proposed algorithm is able to\ngreatly increase the aggregate throughput of the DCF, while ensuring fairness\nlevels among the stations of the same order as the ones guaranteed by the\nclassical PF criterion.\n  Simulation results are presented for some sample scenarios, confirming the\neffectiveness of the proposed criterion for optimized throughput allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 15:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-08"}

This implies that increasing the overall DNA-binding\nprotein concentration would have a marginal effect in reducing the search time,\nbecause any additional proteins would restrict the search process for each\nother. While the presence of other proteins prevents sliding from the flanking\nDNA, DNA looping provides an alternative path to transfer from neighboring\nsites to the target efficiently. We propose that, when looping is faster than\nthe initial search process, the auxiliary binding sites further extend the\neffective target region and therefore facilitate the target location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 15:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-08"}

Being a\nstatistical concept, the state cannot be obtained from a single system\nrealization. It can be reconstructed from an ensemble of copies, by performing\nmeasurements on different realizations. Reconstructing the state of a set of\ntrapped particles shielded from their environment is an important step for the\ninvestigation of the quantum to classical boundary. While trapped atom state\nreconstructions have been achieved, it is challenging to perform similar\nexperiments with trapped photons which require cavities storing light for very\nlong times. Here, we report the complete reconstruction and pictorial\nrepresentation of a variety of radiation states trapped in a cavity in which\nseveral photons survive long enough to be repeatedly measured. Information is\nextracted from the field by atoms crossing the cavity one by one. We exhibit a\ngallery of pictures featuring coherent states, Fock states with a definite\nphoton number and Schrodinger cat states which are superpositions of coherent\nstates with different phases. These states are equivalently represented by\ntheir density matrices in the photon-number basis or by their Wigner functions,\nwhich are distributions of the field complex amplitude. Quasi-classical\ncoherent states have a Gaussian-shaped Wigner function while Fock and\nSchrodinger cat Wigner functions show oscillations and negativities revealing\nquantum interferences. Cavity damping induces decoherence which quickly washes\nout the Wigner functions oscillations. We observe this process and realize\nmovies of decoherence by reconstructing snapshots of Schrodinger cat states at\nsuccessive times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 15:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-25"}

We present a new high-resolution optical spectrum of this\nnuclear cluster, obtained with the ESI Spectrograph at the Keck Observatory.\nThe nucleus has a Seyfert 2 emission-line spectrum at optical wavelengths,\nsupporting the hypothesis that a black hole is present.

If the black hole mass is small compared\nwith the cluster's stellar mass, then the dynamical models imply a total\nstellar mass of ~1*10^7 solar masses, which is consistent with rough estimates\nof the stellar mass based on photometric measurements from HST images.
