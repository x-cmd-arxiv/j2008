This behaviour is typically attributed to energy injection\ninto the burst ejecta. At some point this phase ends, resulting in a break in\nthe lightcurve, which is commonly interpreted as the cessation of the energy\ninjection. In a few cases, however, while breaks in the X-ray lightcurve are\nobserved, optical emission continues its slow flux decline. This behaviour\nsuggests a more complex scenario. In this paper, we present a model that\ninvokes a double component outflow, in which narrowly collimated ejecta are\nresponsible for the X-ray emission while a broad outflow is responsible for the\noptical emission. The narrow component can produce a jet break in the X-ray\nlightcurve at relatively early times, while the optical emission does not break\ndue to its lower degree of collimation. In our model both components are\nsubject to energy injection for the whole duration of the follow-up\nobservations. We apply this model to GRBs with chromatic breaks, and we show\nhow it might change the interpretation of the GRBs canonical lightcurve. We\nalso study our model from a theoretical point of view, investigating the\npossible configurations of frequencies and the values of GRB physical\nparameters allowed in our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2008 18:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In quantum\ninformation processing with solid state qubits, decoherence significantly\nlimits the performances of such devices. Therefore, it is necessary to fully\nunderstand the mechanisms that lead to decoherence. In this review we discuss\nhow decoherence affects two of the most successful realizations of solid state\nqubits, namely, spin-qubits and superconducting qubits. In the former, the\nqubit is encoded in the spin 1/2 of the electron, and it is implemented by\nconfining the electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot. Superconducting\ndevices show quantum behavior at low temperatures, and the qubit is encoded in\nthe two lowest energy levels of a superconducting circuit. The electron spin in\na quantum dot has two main decoherence channels, a (Markovian) phonon-assisted\nrelaxation channel, due to the presence of a spin-orbit interaction, and a\n(non-Markovian) spin bath constituted by the spins of the nuclei in the quantum\ndot that interact with the electron spin via the hyperfine interaction. In a\nsuperconducting qubit, decoherence takes place as a result of fluctuations in\nthe control parameters, such as bias currents, applied flux, and bias voltages,\nand via losses in the dissipative circuit elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2008 21:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-26"}

Kazanas.\nUnlike past similar attempts our approach is a purely kinematical application\nof the conformal symmetry to the Universe, through a critical reanalysis of\nfundamental astrophysical observations, such as the cosmological redshift and\nothers. As a result of this novel approach we obtain a closed-form expression\nfor the cosmic scale factor R(t) and a revised interpretation of the space-time\ncoordinates usually employed in cosmology. New fundamental cosmological\nparameters are introduced and evaluated. This emerging new cosmology does not\nseem to possess any of the controversial features of the current standard\nmodel, such as the presence of dark matter, dark energy or of a cosmological\nconstant, the existence of the horizon problem or of an inflationary phase.\nComparing our results with current conformal cosmologies in the literature, we\nnote that our kinematic cosmology is equivalent to conformal gravity with a\ncosmological constant at late (or early) cosmological times. The cosmic scale\nfactor and the evolution of the Universe are described in terms of several\ndimensionless quantities, among which a new cosmological variable delta emerges\nas a natural cosmic time. The mathematical connections between all these\nquantities are described in details and a relationship is established with the\noriginal kinematic cosmology by L. Infeld and A. Schild. The mathematical\nfoundations of our kinematical conformal cosmology will need to be checked\nagainst current astrophysical experimental data, before this new model can\nbecome a viable alternative to the standard theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2008 23:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 04:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}

Standard LBM, being explicit time-marching in\nnature, requires a long time to attain steady state convergence, particularly\nat low Mach numbers due to the disparity in characteristic speeds of\npropagation of different quantities. In this paper, we present a preconditioned\ngeneralized lattice Boltzmann equation (GLBE) with forcing term to accelerate\nsteady state convergence to flows driven by external forces. The use of\nmultiple relaxation times in the GLBE allows enhancement of the numerical\nstability. Particular focus is given in preconditioning external forces, which\ncan be spatially and temporally dependent. In particular, correct forms of\nmoment-projections of source/forcing terms are derived such that they recover\npreconditioned Navier-Stokes equations with non-uniform external forces. As an\nillustration, we solve an extended system with a preconditioned lattice kinetic\nequation for magnetic induction field at low magnetic Prandtl numbers, which\nimposes Lorentz forces on the flow of conducting fluids. Computational studies,\nparticularly in three-dimensions, for canonical problems show that the number\nof time steps needed to reach steady state is reduced by orders of magnitude\nwith preconditioning. In addition, the preconditioning approach resulted in\nsignificantly improved stability characteristics when compared with the\ncorresponding single relaxation time formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 2008 01:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Let a source with\nunknown statistics generate some word $... x_{-1}x_{0}x_{1}x_{2}...$ in some\nalphabet $A$. For every moment $t, t=... $ $-1, 0, 1, ...$, one stores the word\n(\"window\") $ x_{t-w} x_{t-w+1}... x_{t-1}$ where $w$,$w \\geq 1$, is called\n\"window length\". In the theory of universal coding, the code of the $x_{t}$\ndepends on source ststistics estimated by the window, in the problem of\npredicting, each letter $x_{t}$ is predicted using information of the window,\netc. After that the letter $x_{t}$ is included in the window on the right,\nwhile $x_{t-w}$ is removed from the window. It is the sliding window scheme.\nThis scheme has two merits: it allows one i) to estimate the source statistics\nquite precisely and ii) to adapt the code in case of a change in the source'\nstatistics. However this scheme has a defect, namely, the necessity to store\nthe window (i.e. the word $x_{t-w}... x_{t-1})$ which needs a large memory size\nfor large $w$. A new scheme named \"the Imaginary Sliding Window (ISW)\" is\nconstructed. The gist of this scheme is that not the last element $x_{t-w}$ but\nrather a random one is removed from the window. This allows one to retain both\nmerits of the sliding window as well as the possibility of not storing the\nwindow and thus significantly decreasing the memory size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 2008 07:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-30"}
