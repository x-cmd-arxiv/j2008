It is plausibly an elementary particle, perhaps the lightest\nsupersymmetric partner of known particle species. In this case, annihilation of\ndark matter in the halo of the Milky Way should produce gamma-rays at a level\nwhich may soon be observable. Previous work has argued that the annihilation\nsignal will be dominated by emission from very small clumps (perhaps smaller\neven than the Earth) which would be most easily detected where they cluster\ntogether in the dark matter halos of dwarf satellite galaxies. Here we show,\nusing the largest ever simulation of the formation of a galactic halo, that\nsuch small-scale structure will, in fact, have a negligible impact on dark\nmatter detectability. Rather, the dominant and likely most easily detectable\nsignal will be produced by diffuse dark matter in the main halo of the Milky\nWay. If the main halo is strongly detected, then small dark matter clumps\nshould also be visible, but may well contain no stars, thereby confirming a key\nprediction of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 19:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We detect up to four generations of subhalos within subhalos,\nbut contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhalos than in\nthe main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall\nsubstructure mass fraction is much lower in subhalos than in the main halo.\nExtrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we\npredict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3% within 100 kpc,\nand to be below 0.1% within the Solar Circle. The inner density profiles of\nsubhalos show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well\nfit by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of\nisolated halos are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al.\ndown to maximum circular velocities of 1.5 km/s, an extrapolation over some 5\norders of magnitude in mass.

For students to develop their ability to\nsolve ill-structured problems, they must first believe that standardized\nprocedural approaches will not always be sufficient for solving ill-structured\nengineering and scientific challenges. In this paper we document the range of\nbeliefs university students have about problem-solving. Students enrolled in a\nphysics course submitted a written reflection both at the start and the end of\nthe course on how they solve problems. We coded approximately 500 of these\nreflections for the presence of different problem-solving approaches. At the\nstart of the semester over 50% of the students mention in written reflections\nthat they use Rolodex equation matching, i.e. they solve problems by searching\nfor equations that have the same variables as the knowns and unknowns. We then\ndescribe the extent to which students' beliefs about physics problem-solving\nchange due to their experience throughout a semester with context-rich,\nmultifaceted problems. The frequency of strategies such as the Rolodex method\nreduces only slightly by the end of the semester. However, there is an increase\nin students describing more expansive strategies within their reflections. In\nparticular there is a large increase in describing the use of diagrams, and\nthinking about concepts first. Hence the use of context-rich, multi-faceted\nproblems positively impacts students' attitude towards problem-solving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 17:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-08"}

Previous work has shown that the most\nluminous EELRs are found almost exclusively around steep-spectrum radio-loud\nquasars, with apparently disordered global velocity fields, and little, if any,\nmorphological correlation with either the host-galaxy or the radio structure.\nOur new observations confirm and expand these results. The EELRs often show\nsome clouds with velocities exceeding 500 km/s, ranging up to 1100 km/s, but\nthe velocity dispersions, with few exceptions, are in the 30-100 km/s range.\nEmission-line ratios show that the EELRs are clearly photoionized by the\nquasars. Masses of the EELRs range up to >10^10 Msun. Essentially all of the\nEELRs show relatively low metallicities, and they are associated with quasars\nthat, in contrast to most, show similarly low metallicities in their broad-line\nregions.

We searched for \"invariant\nloops\": closed curves (analogous to stable periodic orbits in time-independent\npotentials) that change shape with the binary orbital phase, as test particles\nin them move under the influence of the binary potential. This approach allows\nus to identify stable configurations when pressure forces are unimportant, and\ndissipation acts only to prevent gas clouds from colliding with one another. We\nnow extend this work to study the main geometrical properties of circumbinary\ndiscs. We have studied more than 100 cases with a range in eccentricity 0 .le.\ne .le. 0.9, and mass ratio 0.1 .le. q .le. 0.9.

The radii for stable orbits that can host gas in\ncircumbinary discs are sharply constrained as a function of the binary's\neccentricity. The circumbinary disc configurations are almost circular, with\neccentricity e_d < 0.15, but if the mass ratio is unequal the disk is offset\nfrom the center of mass of the system.

In fact, there is a flood of models\nbelonging to new physics which can result in products with characteristics\nsimilar to $H_{TC}+\\Pi$ of the TC2 model.

We assume here that the corona is\nin a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium and that, because of the low plasma beta,\none may decouple the magnetic forces from pressure and gravity. The magnetic\nfield is then described by a force-free field for which we perform a\nstatistical study of the magnetic field strength with height for four different\nactive regions. The plasma along each field line is assumed to be in a\nhydrostatic equilibrium. As a first approximation, the coronal plasma is\nassumed to be isothermal with a constant or varying gravity with height. We\nstudy a bipolar magnetic field with a ring distribution of currents, and apply\nthis method to four active regions associated with different eruptive events.\nBy studying the global properties of the magnetic field strength above active\nregions, we conclude that (i) most of the magnetic flux is localized within 50\nMm of the photosphere, (ii) most of the energy is stored in the corona below\n150 Mm, (iii) most of the magnetic field strength decays with height for a\nnonlinear force-free field slower than for a potential field. The Alfven speed\nvalues in an isothermal atmosphere can vary by two orders of magnitude (up to\n100000 km/s).

We show that there is a constant spatial flux of spanwise\nvorticity, due to vorticity conservation, and that this flux is necessary to\nproduce pressure-drop and energy dissipation. The vorticity transport is shown\nto be dominated by viscous diffusion at distances closer to the wall than the\npeak Reynolds stress, well into the classical log-layer.

The\nmetric on M induced by the ambient spherical geometry of S is the Fisher\ninformation matrix. Statistical properties of the system modelled by a\nparametric density function p can then be expressed in terms of information\ngeometry. An elementary introduction to information geometry is presented,\nfollowed by a precise geometric characterisation of the family of Gaussian\ndensity functions. When the parametric density function describes the\nequilibrium state of a physical system, certain physical characteristics can be\nidentified with geometric features of the associated information manifold M.\nApplying this idea, the properties of vapour-liquid phase transitions are\nelucidated in geometrical terms. For an ideal gas, phase transitions are absent\nand the geometry of M is flat. In this case, the solutions to the geodesic\nequations yield the adiabatic equations of state. For a van der Waals gas, the\nassociated geometry of M is highly nontrivial. The scalar curvature of M\ndiverges along the spinodal boundary which envelopes the unphysical region in\nthe phase diagram.

Here we explore the relation between folding\nplasticity and a gross, generic feature of the native geometry, namely, the\nrelative number of local and non-local native contacts. The results from our\nstudy, which is based on Monte Carlo simulations of simple lattice proteins,\nshow that folding to a structure that is rich in local contacts is considerably\nmore plastic than folding to a native geometry characterized by having a very\nlarge number of long-range contacts (i.e., contacts between amino acids that\nare separated by more than 12 units of backbone distance). The smaller folding\nplasticity of `non-local' native geometries is probably a direct consequence of\ntheir higher folding cooperativity that renders the folding reaction more\nrobust against single- and multiple-point mutations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2008 15:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-09"}
