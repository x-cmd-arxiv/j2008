This method is based on the maximal\nsymmetry present at lowest order in a perturbation series in inverse spatial\ndimensions. The symmetric structure at lowest order has a point group\nisomorphic with the S_N group, the symmetric group of N particles, and the\nresulting perturbation expansion of the Hamiltonian is order-by-order invariant\nunder the permutations of the S_N group. This invariance under S_N imposes\nsevere symmetry requirements on the tensor blocks needed at each order in the\nperturbation series. We show here that these blocks can be decomposed into a\nbasis of binary tensors invariant under S_N. This basis is small (25 terms at\nfirst order in the wave function), independent of N, and is derived using\ngraphical techniques. This checks the N^6 scaling of these terms at first order\nby effectively separating the N scaling problem away from the rest of the\nphysics. The transformation of each binary tensor to the final normal\ncoordinate basis requires the derivation of Clebsch-Gordon coefficients of S_N\nfor arbitrary N. This has been accomplished using the group theory of the\nsymmetric group. This achievement results in an analytic solution for the wave\nfunction, exact through first order, that scales as N^0, effectively\ncircumventing intensive numerical work.

The high-angular resolution\nsub-mm continuum image of G034.43+00.24 MM1 reveals a compact (~0.03 pc) and\nmassive (~29 Msun) structure while the molecular line spectrum shows emission\nfrom numerous complex molecules. Such a rich molecular line spectrum from a\ncompact region indicates that G034.43+00.24 MM1 contains a hot molecular core,\nan early stage in the formation of a high-mass protostar.

The former describes flares with\nassociated coronal mass ejections (CMEs), while the latter denotes flares\nwithout associated CMEs. We find that about 90% of X-class flares are eruptive,\nbut the remaining 10% are confined. To probe why the largest energy releases\ncould be either eruptive or confined, we investigate four X-class events from\neach of the two types. Both sets of events are selected to have very similar\nintensities (X1.0 to X3.6) and duration (rise time under 13 minutes and decay\ntime not over 9 minutes) in soft X-ray observations, to reduce any bias due to\nflare size on CME occurrence. We find that the occurrence of eruption (or\nconfinement) is sensitive to the displacement of the location of the energy\nrelease, defined as the distance between the flare site and the flux-weighted\nmagnetic center of the source active region. The displacement is 6 - 17 Mm for\nconfined events but as large as 22 - 37 Mm for eruptive events. This means that\nconfined events occur closer to the magnetic center, while the eruptive events\ntend to occur close to the edge of active regions. We use the potential field\nsource-surface model to infer the coronal magnetic field above the source\nactive regions and calculate the flux ratio of low (<1.1 Rs) to high (>1.1 Rs)\ncorona. We find that the confined events have a lower ratio (<5.7) than the\neruptive events (>7.1).

The strength of shocks plays a key role in\nshock-related phenomena, such as radio bursts and solar energetic particle\n(SEP) generation. This paper presents an improved method of calculating Alfven\nspeed and shock strength near the Sun. This method is based on using as many\nobservations as possible, rather than one-dimensional global models. Two\nevents, a relatively slow CME on 2001 September 15 and a very fast CME on 2000\nJune 15, are selected to illustrate the calculation process. The calculation\nresults suggest that the slow CME drove a strong shock, with Mach number of\n3.43 - 4.18, while the fast CME drove a relatively weak shock, with Mach number\nof 1.90 - 3.21. This is consistent with the radio observations, which find a\nstronger and longer decameter-hectometric (DH) type II radio burst during the\nfirst event, and a short DH type II radio burst during the second event. In\nparticular, the alculation results explain the observational fact that the slow\nCME produced a major solar energetic particle (SEP) event, while the fast CME\ndid not.

We develop a method that can extend the\ndynamic range of the Plin(k) recovery by incorporating constraints on the\ngalaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) from the projected galaxy correlation\nfunction wp. We devise an analytic model to calculate Pobs(k) in real-space and\nredshift-space.

With this modification, the model reproduces\nthe observed gas mass fractions and luminosity-temperature relation of groups\nand clusters. Introducing the heating process into the model requires changes\nto a number of model parameters in order to retain a good match to the observed\ngalaxy properties. With the revised parameters, the best fitting luminosity\nfunction is comparable to that presented in Bower et al. (2006). The new model\nmakes a fundamental step forward, providing a unified model of galaxy and\ncluster ICM formation. However, the detailed comparison with the data is not\ncompletely satisfactory, and we highlight key areas for improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2008 10:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2008 14:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Its conventional\ndefinition as the range between $\\sim 0.6$ and 1.6 Einstein radii of the\nprimary lens is based on the criterion that a major caustic induced by a planet\nshould be located within the Einstein ring of the primary. However, current\nplanetary lensing searches focus on high-magnification events to detect\nperturbations induced by another caustic located always within the Einstein\nring very close to the primary lens (stellar caustic) and thus a new definition\nof a lensing zone is needed. In this paper, we determine this lensing zone. By\napplying a criterion that detectable planets should produce signals $\\geq 5%$,\nwe find that the new lensing zone varies depending on the planet/star mass\nratio unlike the fixed range of the classical zone regardless of the mass\nratio. The lensing zone is equivalent to the classical zone for a planet with a\nplanet/star mass ratio $q\\sim 3\\times 10^{-4}$ and it becomes wider for heavier\nplanets. For a Jupiter-mass planet, the lensing zone ranges from 0.25 to 3.9\nEinstein radii, corresponding to a physical range between $\\sim 0.5$ AU and 7.4\nAU for a typical Galactic event.

This concept was originally proposed as a viable mechanism\nfor the \"cosmic accelerator\" that would accelerate cosmic particles to ultra\nhigh energies in the astrophysical setting. Unlike the more familiar Plasma\nWakefield Accelerator (PWFA) and the Laser Wakefield Accelerator (LWFA) where\nthe drivers, the charged-particle beam and the laser, are independently\nexisting entities, MPWA invokes the high-frequency and high-speed whistler mode\nas the driver, which is a medium wave that cannot exist outside of the plasma.\nAside from the difference in drivers, the underlying mechanism that excites the\nplasma wakefield via the ponderomotive potential is common. Our computer\nsimulations show that under appropriate conditions, the plasma wakefield\nmaintains very high coherence and can sustain high-gradient acceleration over\nmany plasma wavelengths. We suggest that in addition to its celestial\napplication, the MPWA concept can also be of terrestrial utility. A\nproof-of-principle experiment on MPWA would benefit both terrestrial and\ncelestial accelerator concepts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2008 07:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Different\nformation channels are considered to be possible and to lead to a variety of\nhelium-burning subdwarfs. All seismic models to date, however, assume that a\nsubdwarf B star is a post-helium-flash-core surrounded by a thin inert layer of\nhydrogen. We examine an alternative formation channel, in which the subdwarf B\nstar originates from a massive (>~2 Msun) red giant with a non-degenerate\nhelium-core. Although these subdwarfs may evolve through the same region of the\nlog g-Teff diagram as the canonical post-flash subdwarfs, their interior\nstructure is rather different. We examine how this difference affects their\npulsation modes and whether it can be observed.\n  Using detailed stellar evolution calculations we construct subdwarf B models\nfrom both formation channels. The iron accumulation in the driving region due\nto diffusion, which causes the excitation of the modes, is approximated by a\nGaussian function. The pulsation modes and frequencies are calculated with a\nnon-adiabatic pulsation code. A detailed comparison of two subdwarf B models\nfrom different channels, but with the same log g and Teff, shows that their\nmode excitation is different. The excited frequencies are lower for the\npost-flash than for the post-non-degenerate subdwarf B star. This is mainly due\nto the differing chemical composition of the stellar envelope. A more general\ncomparison between two grids of models shows that the excited frequencies of\nmost post-non-degenerate subdwarfs cannot be well-matched with the frequencies\nof post-flash subdwarfs. In the rare event that an acceptable seismic match is\nfound, additional information, such as mode identification and log g and Teff\ndeterminations, allows us to distinguish between the two formation channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2008 09:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In order to guarantee their scientific\nsuccess, it is necessary to evaluate if the photon counts available at these\nresolution and cadence will provide a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\n  We perform a first step in this direction by analyzing and characterizing the\nspatial intermittency of Quiet Sun images thanks to a multifractal analysis.\n  We identify the parameters that specify the scale-invariance behavior. This\nidentification allows next to select a family of multifractal processes, namely\nthe Compound Poisson Cascades, that can synthesize artificial images having\nsome of the scale-invariance properties observed on the recorded images.\n  The prevalence of self-similarity in Quiet Sun coronal images makes it\nrelevant to study the ratio between the SNR present at SoHO/EIT images and in\ncoarsened images. SoHO/EIT images thus play the role of 'high resolution'\nimages, whereas the 'low-resolution' coarsened images are rebinned so as to\nsimulate a smaller angular resolution and/or a larger distance to the Sun. For\na fixed difference in angular resolution and in Spacecraft-Sun distance, we\ndetermine the proportion of pixels having a SNR preserved at high resolution\ngiven a particular increase in effective area. If scale-invariance continues to\nprevail at smaller scales, the conclusion reached with SoHO/EIT images can be\ntransposed to the situation where the resolution is increased from SoHO/EIT to\nSO/HRI resolution at perihelion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2008 12:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Drawing largely on the methods\ndeveloped in our group over the last twenty years, we describe a number of key\napplications ranging from folding of proteins with disulfide bonds to functions\nof molecular machines. After presenting the theoretical basis that justifies\nthe use of CG models, we explore the biophysical basis for the emergence of a\nfinite number of folds from lattice models. The lattice model simulations of\napproach to the folded state show that non-native interactions are relevant\nonly early in the folding process - a finding that rationalizes the success of\nstructure-based models that emphasize native interactions. Applications of\noff-lattice $C_{\\alpha}$ and models that explicitly consider side chains\n($C_{\\alpha}$-SCM) to folding of $\\beta$-hairpin and effects of macromolecular\ncrowding are briefly discussed. Successful application of a new class of\noff-lattice model, referred to as the Self-Organized Polymer (SOP), is shown by\ndescribing the response of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to mechanical force.\nThe utility of the SOP model is further illustrated by applications that\nclarify the functions of the chaperonin GroEL and motion of the molecular motor\nkinesin. We also present two distinct models for RNA, namely, the Three Site\nInteraction (TIS) model and the SOP model, that probe forced unfolding and\nforce quench refolding of a simple hairpin and {\\it Azoarcus} ribozyme. The\npredictions based on the SOP model show that force-induced unfolding pathways\nof the ribozyme can be dramatically changed by varying the loading rate. We\nconclude with a discussion of future prospects for the use of coarse-grained\nmodels in addressing problems of outstanding interest in biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2008 15:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-25"}

Methods: The model\ntreats the heavy ions as test particles convected by (and in a particular case\nalso diffusing through) a hydrodynamically calculated background plasma flow,\nfrom 1 AU to the termination shock (TS), to heliosheath (HS) and finally to\nheliospheric tail (HT). The ions undergo radiative and dielectronic\nrecombinations, charge exchanges, photo- and electron impact ionizations with\nplasma particles, interstellar neutral atoms (calculated on a Monte-Carlo\nmodel) and solar photons. Results: Highly-charged heavy coronal ions flowing\nwith the solar wind undergo successive de-ionizations, mainly in the\nheliosheath, leading to charge-states much lower than in the supersonic solar\nwind. If Coulomb scattering is the main ion energy loss mechanism, the end\nproduct of these deionizations are fluxes of ENA of ~1 keV/nucleon originating\nin the upwind heliosheath that for C, Mg, Si and S may constitute sources of\npickup ions (PUI) significantly exceeding the interstellar supply. Conclusions:\nDiscussed processes result in (i) distinct difference of ion charge q in the\nsupersonic solar wind (approximately q >= +Z/2, Z = atomic number) compared to\nthat in the HS (approximately 0 <= q <= +Z/2)), (ii) probable concentration of\nsingly ionized atoms (q = +1) in the heliosheath towards the heliopause (HP)\nand in the HT, (iii) possible significant production of ENA in the HS offering\nnatural explanation for production of PUI, and -- after acceleration at the TS\n-- anomalous cosmic rays (ACR) of species (like C, Mg, Si, S) unable to enter\nthe heliospheric cavity from outside because of their total ionization in the\nlocal interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2008 15:51:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2008 23:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
