We use a generic model of the memory response, which is\napplicable to any linear storage medium ranging from a superconducting device\nto an atomic medium. The temporal switching or gating of the device may either\nbe through a control field changing the coupling, or through a variable\ndetuning approach, as in more recent quantum memory experiments. An exact\ncalculation of the temporal memory response to an external input is carried\nout. This shows that there is a mode-matching criterion which determines the\noptimum input and output mode shape. This optimum pulse shape can be modified\nby changing the gate characteristics. In addition, there is a critical coupling\nbetween the atoms and the cavity that allows high fidelity in the presence of\nlong storage times.

One reason for this is\nthat after hydrogen burning, stellar evolution proceeds at conditions of equal\nnumber of neutrons and protons or at a slight degree of neutron-richness.\nProton-rich nucleosynthesis in stars tends to occur only when hydrogen-rich\nmaterial that accretes onto a white dwarf or neutron star explodes, or when\nneutrino interactions in the winds from a nascent proto-neutron star or\ncollapsar-disk drive the matter proton-rich prior to or during the\nnucleosynthesis. In this paper we solve the NSE equations for a range of\nproton-rich thermodynamic conditions. We show that cold proton-rich NSE is\nqualitatively different from neutron-rich NSE. Instead of being dominated by\nthe Fe-peak nuclei with the largest binding energy per nucleon that have a\nproton to nucleon ratio close to the prescribed electron fraction, NSE for\nproton-rich material near freeze-out temperature is mainly composed of Ni56 and\nfree protons. Previous results of nuclear reaction network calculations rely on\nthis non-intuitive high proton abundance, which this paper will explain. We\nshow how the differences and especially the large fraction of free protons\narises from the minimization of the free energy as a result of a delicate\ncompetition between the entropy and the nuclear binding energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2008 17:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Unlike the hydrodynamics of bulk fluids, low-Reynolds\nnumber membrane hydrodynamics is characterized by an inherent length scale\ngenerated by the coupling of the membrane to the bulk fluids that surround it.\nAs a result, we find that the size of the particles in the suspension relative\nto this hydrodynamic length scale has a dramatic effect on the effective\nviscosity of the suspension.

We begin\nby reproducing the results of Firmani for his 19 bursts. We then test the\nFirmani relation for the same 19 bursts except that we use independently\nmeasured values for L_iso, T_0.45, and E_peak, and we find that the relation\ndeteriorates substantially.

When the density of electrons in the wire is very low, the strong\nrepulsion between electrons leads to the formation of a Wigner crystal. We\nreview the rich spin and orbital properties of the Wigner crystal, both in the\none-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional regime. In the one-dimensional Wigner\ncrystal the electron spins form an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with\nexponentially small exchange coupling. In the presence of leads the resulting\ninhomogeneity of the electron density causes a violation of spin-charge\nseparation. As a consequence the spin degrees of freedom affect the conductance\nof the wire. Upon increasing the electron density, the Wigner crystal starts\ndeviating from the strictly one-dimensional geometry, forming a zigzag\nstructure instead. Spin interactions in this regime are dominated by ring\nexchanges, and the phase diagram of the resulting zigzag spin chain has a\nnumber of unpolarized phases as well as regions of complete and partial spin\npolarization. Finally we address the orbital properties in the vicinity of the\ntransition from a one-dimensional to a quasi-one-dimensional state. Due to the\nlocking between chains in the zigzag Wigner crystal, only one gapless mode\nexists. Manifestations of Wigner crystal physics at weak interactions are\nexplored by studying the fate of the additional gapped low-energy mode as a\nfunction of interaction strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2008 00:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2008 17:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We propose to study concurrent imitation dynamics that\nemerge when each player samples another player and possibly imitates this\nagents' strategy if the anticipated latency gain is sufficiently large. Our\nmain focus is on convergence properties. Using a potential function argument,\nwe show that our dynamics converge in a monotonic fashion to stable states.

As our main result, we show rapid convergence to approximate equilibria.\nAt an approximate equilibrium only a small fraction of agents sustains a\nlatency significantly above or below average. In particular, imitation dynamics\nbehave like fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS). Fixing all\nother parameters, the convergence time depends only in a logarithmic fashion on\nthe number of agents. Since imitation processes are not innovative they cannot\ndiscover unused strategies. Furthermore, strategies may become extinct with\nnon-zero probability.

We model subsequent\nevolutionary processes in several ways and construct possible self-similar\nshock flow solutions. We may neglect the mass and gravity of the central\nprotostar. The ionization and heating of the surrounding medium drive outflows\nin the inner cloud core and a shock travels outwards, leading to the so-called\n\"champagne phase\" with an expanding outer cloud envelope. Complementarily, we\nalso consider the expansion of a central cavity around the centre. As the inner\ncloud expands plausibly due to powerful stellar winds, a cavity (i.e., `void'\nor `bubble') can be created around the centre, and when the cavity becomes\nsufficiently large, one may neglect the gravity of the central protostar.

First, I focus on the Adiabatic Quantum Computing model, based on\nevolution with a time dependent Hamiltonian. I show that to succeed using AQC,\nthe Hamiltonian involved must have local structure, which leads to a result\nabout eigenvalue gaps from information theory. I also improve results about\nsimulating quantum circuits with AQC. Second, I look at classically simulating\ntime evolution with local Hamiltonians and finding their ground state\nproperties. I give a numerical method for finding the ground state of\ntranslationally invariant Hamiltonians on an infinite tree. This method is\nbased on imaginary time evolution within the Matrix Product State ansatz, and\nuses a new method for bringing the state back to the ansatz after each\nimaginary time step.

The\naim of this paper is to provide theoretical explanations of these anomalies in\ngeneral and a quantitative theory in the case of a simple model of\nglass-formation. We first present new simulation results for the specific heat\nin a classical model of a binary mixture. We show that in addition to the\nformerly observed specific heat peak there is a second peak at lower\ntemperatures which was not observable in earlier simulations. Second, we\npresent a general relation between the specific heat and the bulk modulus and\nthus offer a smooth connection between the liquid and amorphous solid states.\nThe central result of this paper is a connection between the micro-melting of\nclusters in the system and the appearance of specific heat peaks.

Secondly, a novel non-perturbative\nanalytic solution for the on-shell GW0 self-energy as a function of momentum is\npresented. It reproduces the numerical data for the spectral function with a\nrelative error of less than 10% in the regime where the Debye screening\nparameter is smaller than the inverse Bohr radius, kappa<1/a_B.
