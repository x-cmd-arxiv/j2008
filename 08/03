The approach combines a non-equilibrium\nGreen's function (NEGF) description of the non-equilibrium junction with a\ngeneralized scattering theory formulation for evaluating the light scattering\nsignal. This generalizes our previous study (Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 206802\n(2005); J. Chem.

For large\nenough voltage bias we find that the light scattering signal contains, in\naddition to the normal signal associated with the molecular ground electronic\nstate, also a contribution from the inverse process originated from the excited\nmolecular state as well as an interference component. The effect of coupling to\nthe electrodes and of the imposed bias on the total Raman scattering as well as\nits components are discussed. Our result reduces to the standard expression for\nRaman scattering in the isolated molecule case, i.e. in the absence of coupling\nto the electrodes. The theory is used to discuss the charge transfer\ncontribution to surface enhanced Raman scattering for molecules adsorbed on\nmetal surfaces and its manifestation in the biased junction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2008 03:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-09"}

The computational complexity of various\nsolution concepts for weighted voting games received a lot of attention in\nrecent years.
