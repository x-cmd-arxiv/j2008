An effective black\nholes (BH) in curved Riemannian spacetime in a random walk plasmas is endowed\nwith a naked singularity, when plasmas are in the lowest diffusion mode. The\nplasma particle diffusion is encoded in the effective metric. The diffusive\nsolution has a horizon when the plasma flow reaches the sound velocity in the\nmedium and a shock wave is obtained inside the slab. The sonic black hole\ncurved Riemannian metric is also found in terms of particle number density in\nplasmas. The sonic BH singularity is found at the center of the plasma\ndiffusive slab from the study of the Ricci curvature scalar for constant\ndiffusion coefficient. It is suggested and shown that the Hawking temperature\nis proportional to the plasma Kelvin temperature through diffusion coefficient\ndependence to this temperature. Therefore Unruh sonic or dumb BH is shown to\nhave a relation between Hawking and plasma diffusive temperatures. BH\nevaporation is analogous to the diffusive phenomena in plasmas, since in both\ncases Hawking temperature is inversely proportional to mass.

However when sparticles are produced the signatures of their\nproduction will to a significant degree depend on their hierarchical mass\npatterns. Here we investigate hierarchical mass patterns for the four lightest\nsparticles within one of the leading candidate theories - the SUGRA model.\nSpecifically we analyze the hierarchies for the four lightest sparticles for\nthe mSUGRA as well as for a general class of supergravity unified models\nincluding nonuniversalities in the soft breaking sector. It is shown that out\nof nearly $10^4$ possibilities of sparticle mass hierarchies, only a small\nnumber survives the rigorous constraints of radiative electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, relic density and other experimental constraints. The signature space\nof these mass patterns at the LHC is investigated using a large set of final\nstates including multi-leptonic states, hadronically decaying $\\tau$s, tagged\n$b$ jets and other hadronic jets. In all, we analyze more than 40 such lepton\nplus jet and missing energy signatures along with several kinematical\nsignatures such as missing transverse momentum, effective mass, and invariant\nmass distributions of final state observables. It is shown that a composite\nanalysis can produce significant discrimination among sparticle mass patterns\nallowing for a possible identification of the source of soft breaking. While\nthe analysis given is for supergravity models, the techniques used in the\nanalysis are applicable to wide class of models including string and brane\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2008 23:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-26"}

The Poisson nature of the photon counts leads\nto local random fluctuations in the observed spectrum that often results in\nexcess emission in a narrow band of energy resembling a weak narrow line. From\na formal statistical perspective, this leads to a (sometimes highly) multimodal\nlikelihood. Many standard statistical procedures are based on (asymptotic)\nGaussian approximations to the likelihood and simply cannot be used in such\nsettings. Bayesian methods offer a more direct paradigm for accounting for such\ncomplicated likelihood functions but even here multimodal likelihoods pose\nsignificant computational challenges. The new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethods developed in 2008 by van Dyk and Park, however, are able to fully\nexplore the complex posterior distribution of the location of a narrow line,\nand thus provide valid statistical inference. Even with these computational\ntools, standard statistical quantities such as means and standard deviations\ncannot adequately summarize inference and standard testing procedures cannot be\nused to test for emission lines.

The description\ngoes beyond probabilities. The EPR-type disentanglement, consisting in two\nmutually incompatible distant measurements, is used as a general framework in\nboth parts of this study. Two simple coherence cases are shown to emerge\nnaturally, and they are precisely the two experiments of Scully et al. The\ntreatment seems to require the relative-reality-of-unitarily-evolving-state\n(RRUES) approach. Besides insight in the exoeriments, this study has also the\ngoal of insight in quantum mechanics. The question is if it can be more than\njust a \"book-keeping device\" for calculating probabilities as Scully et al.\nmodestly and cautiously claim.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2008 09:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-03"}

The\nsimulations are double periodic and taken as a proxy for the situation in the\nfoot. The linear analysis for relatively cold unmagnetized plasmas with a\nreflected proton beam shows that obliquely propagating Buneman instability is\nstrongly excited. We also found that when the electron temperature is much\nhigher than the proton temperature, the most unstable mode is the highly\nobliquely propagating ion two-stream instability excited through the resonance\nbetween ion plasma oscillations of the background protons and of the beam\nprotons, rather than the ion acoustic instability that is dominant for parallel\npropagation. To investigate nonlinear behavior of the ion two-stream\ninstability, we have made PIC simulations for the shock foot region in which\nthe initial state satisfies the Buneman instability condition. In the first\nphase, electrostatic waves grow two-dimensionally by the Buneman instability to\nheat electrons. In the second phase, highly oblique ion two-stream instability\ngrows to heat mainly ions. This result is in contrast to previous studies based\non one-dimensional simulations, for which ion acoustic instability further\nheats electrons. The present result implies that overheating problem of\nelectrons for shocks in supernova remnants is resolved by considering ion\ntwo-stream instability propagating highly obliquely to the shock normal and\nthat multi-dimensional analysis is crucial to understand the particle heating\nand acceleration processes in shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2008 14:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here\nwe consider two restaurants only and a large number of customers (agents) who\ncome to these restaurants. Each day the same number of agents sequentially\narrives and decides which restaurant to enter. If all the agents literally\nfollow the crowd then there is no difference between this model and the famous\n`P\\'olya's Urn' model. But as agents alter their strategies different kind of\ndynamics of the model is seen. It is seen from numerical results that the\nexistence of a distribution of the fixed points is quite robust and it is also\nseen that in some cases the variations in the ratio of the queue-lengths follow\na power-law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2008 14:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

In particular, collimation of an\nelectron beam is a long-standing goal. We show that ballistic propagation of an\nelectron beam with virtual no spatial spreading or diffraction, without a\nwaveguide or external magnetic field, can be achieved in graphene under an\nappropriate class of experimentally feasible one-dimensional external periodic\npotentials. The novel chiral quasi-one-dimensional metallic state that the\ncharge carriers are in originates from a collapse of the intrinsic helical\nnature of the charge carriers in graphene owing to the superlattice potential.\nBeyond providing a new way to constructing chiral one-dimensional states in two\ndimensions, our findings should be useful in graphene-based electronic devices\n(e.g., for information processing) utilizing some of the highly developed\nconcepts in optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2008 15:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-11"}
