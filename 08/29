Starting from the\nrobust, open source ATLAS atmospheric code (Kurucz, 1979), we have developed a\nspherically symmetric code, SATLAS, as a new option for modeling stellar\natmospheres of low gravity stars. The SATLAS code is tested against both\ninterferometric observations of M giants by Wittkowski and collaborators, and\nspherically symmetric M giant NextGen models from the PHOENIX code. The SATLAS\nmodels predict interferometric visibilities that agree with the observed\nvisibilities and with predicted visibilities, and the SATLAS atmospheric\nstructures also agree with those from spherical PHOENIX models, with just small\ndifferences in temperature and pressure at large depths in the atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 21:17:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 05:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this temperature region, under the strong influence of Bose\nstatistics, the coherent many-body wave function grows to an intermediate size\nbetween a macroscopic and a microscopic one, which is different from thermal\nfluctuation. We consider such a capillary flow by including it to a general\npicture that includes the flow of rotating helium 4 as well.

By a finite size scaling analysis we have identified a mobility edge for\na certain value of the kicking strength $k = k_c$. For $k > k_c$ dynamical\nlocalization does not occur, all eigenstates are delocalized and the spectral\ncorrelations are well described by Wigner-Dyson statistics. This can be\nunderstood by mapping the kicked rotor problem onto a 3d Anderson model (AM)\nwhere a band of metallic states exists for sufficiently weak disorder. Around\nthe critical region $k \\approx k_c$ we have carried out a detailed study of the\nlevel statistics and quantum diffusion. In agreement with the predictions of\nthe one parameter scaling theory (OPT) and with previous numerical simulations\nof a 3d AM at the transition, the number variance is linear, level repulsion is\nstill observed and quantum diffusion is anomalous with $<p^2 > \\propto\nt^{2/3}$. We note that in the 3d kicked rotor the dynamics is not random but\ndeterministic. In order to estimate the differences between these two\nsituations we have studied a 3d kicked rotor in which the kinetic term of the\nassociated evolution matrix is random. A detailed numerical comparison shows\nthat the differences between the two cases are relatively small. However in the\ndeterministic case only a small set of irrational periods was used. A\nqualitative analysis of a much larger set suggests that the deviations between\nthe random and the deterministic kicked rotor can be important for certain\nchoices of periods.

These detections of activity were contemporaneous with a period of\nintense optical activity, which was monitored by GASP-WEBT. This simultaneous\noptical and gamma-ray coverage allows us to study in detail the light curves,\ntime lags, gamma-ray photon spectrum, and Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs)\nduring different states of activity. AGILE observed the source with its two\nco-aligned imagers, the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) and the hard X-ray\nimager (Super-AGILE), which are sensitive to the 30 MeV-50 GeV and 18-60 keV\nenergy ranges, respectively. Observations were completed in two different\nperiods, the first between 2007 September 4-23, and the second between 2007\nOctober 24-November 1. Over the period 2007 September 7-12, AGILE detected\ngamma-ray emission from the source at a significance level of 9.6-sigma with an\naverage flux (E>100 MeV) of (97 +/- 15) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which\nincreased by a factor of at least four within three days. No emission was\ndetected by Super-AGILE for the energy range 18-60 keV to a 3-sigma upper limit\nof 10 mCrab in 335 ksec. In October 2007, AGILE repointed toward S5 0716+714\nfollowing an intense optical flare, measuring an average flux of (47 +/- 11) x\n10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} at a significance level of 6.0-sigma. The\ngamma-ray flux of S5 0716+714 detected by AGILE is the highest ever detected\nfor this blazar and one of the most intense gamma-ray fluxes detected from a BL\nLac object. The SED of mid-September appears to be consistent with the\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission model, but only by including two SSC\ncomponents of different variabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2008 09:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, this is very surprising as the disc\ntemperature drops by more than a factor 3 in the soft state, which should\nproduce a marked change in the reprocessing efficiency. The easiest way to\nmatch the observed constant reprocessed fraction is for the disc skin to be\nhighly ionized (as suggested 30 years ago by van Paradijs), so that the bulk of\nthe disc flux is reflected and only the hardest X-rays heat the disc. The\nconstant reprocessed fraction also favours direct illumination of the disc over\na scattering origin as the optical depth/solid angle of any scattering material\n(wind/corona) over the disc should decrease as the source luminosity declines.\nBy contrast, the reprocessed fraction increases very significantly (by a factor\n~6) as the source enters the hard state. This dramatic change is not evident\nfrom X-ray/UV flux correlations as it is masked by bandpass effects.

Drawing on simple models of semiflexible worm-like\nchains we derive an expression for the probability distribution of crosslink\nseparations valid at all separations. This accounts for both entropic and\nmechanical filament stretching. From this we obtain the free energy density of\nsuch networks explicitly as a function of applied strain. We are therefore able\nto calculate the elastic moduli of such networks for any imposed strain or\nstress. We find that accounting for the distribution of cross-link separations\ndestroys the simple scaling of modulus with stress that is well known in single\nchains, and that such scaling is sensitive to the mechanical stretch modulus of\nindividual filaments. We compare this model to three experimental data sets,\nfor networks of different types of filaments, and find that a properly treated\naffine model can successfully account for the data. We find that for networks\nof stiffer filaments, such as F-actin, to fit data we require a much smaller\neffective persistence length than usually assumed to be characteristic of this\nfilament type.

Yet, at the same time, local knowledge available at a given server can\noften be irreplaceable in identifying specific spammers. To this end, in this\npaper we show how the local intelligence of mail servers can be gathered and\ncorrelated pas- sively at the ISP-level providing valuable network-wide\ninformation. Specifically, we use first a large network flow trace from a\nmedium size, national ISP, to demonstrate that the pre-filtering decisions of\nindividual mail servers can be tracked and combined at the flow level.

The Feynman loop integrals that appear have a\ngraphical representation with only cubic vertices, and numerator factors that\nare quadratic in the loop momenta, rather than quartic as in the previous form.\nThis quadratic behavior reflects cancellations beyond those required for\nfiniteness, and matches the quadratic behavior of the three-loop four-point\nscattering amplitude in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. By direct integration we\nconfirm that no additional cancellations remain in the N=8 supergravity\namplitude, thus demonstrating that the critical dimension in which the first\nultraviolet divergence occurs at three loops is D_c=6. We also give the values\nof the three-loop divergences in D=7,9,11. In addition, we present the\nexplicitly color-dressed three-loop four-point amplitude of N=4\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2008 15:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Current studies on this\nmostly rely on fitting the afterglow spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with\ntemplate extinction models. The inferred extinction (both quantity and\nwavelength-dependence) and dust-to-gas ratios are often in disagreement with\nthat obtained from dust depletion and X-ray spectroscopy studies. We argue that\nthis discrepancy could result from the prior assumption of a template\nextinction law. We propose an analytical formula to approximate the GRB host\nextinction law. With the template extinction laws self-contained, and the\ncapability of revealing extinction laws differing from the conventional ones,\nit is shown that this is a powerful approach in modeling the afterglow SEDs to\nderive GRB host extinction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2008 15:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
