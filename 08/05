We re-derive and extend the results here using a\nLaplace-transform technique, and show that the singlet quark structure function\nF_S(x,Q^2) can be determined directly in terms of G from the DGLAP gluon\nevolution equation. To illustrate the method and check the consistency of\nexisting LO quark and gluon distributions, we used the published values of the\nLO quark distributions from the CTEQ5L and MRST2001LO analyses to form\nF_2^{\\gamma p} (x, Q^2), and then solved analytically for G(x,Q^2). We find\nthat the analytic and fitted gluon distributions from MRST2001LO agree well\nwith each other for all x and Q^2, while those from CTEQ5L differ significantly\nfrom each other for large x values, x>~0.03 - 0.05 at all Q^2. We conclude that\nthe published CTEQ5L distributions are incompatible in this region. Using a\nnon-singlet evolution equation, we obtain a sensitive test of quark\ndistributions which holds in both LO and NLO perturbative QCD. We find in\neither case that the CTEQ5 quark distributions satisfy the tests numerically\nfor small x, but fail the tests for x>~0.03 - 0.05 - their use could\npotentially lead to significant shifts in predictions of quantities sensitive\nto large x.

To unify and generalize these various forms we consider P as the most\ngeneral quadratic function of the spin components that vanishes whenever Sa and\nSb are collinear, i.e. we consider the most general expressions that require\nspin canting. The study reveals new forms. We generalize to the vector P,\nMoriya's symmetry considerations regarding the (scalar) Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\nenergy D. Sa x Sb (which led to restrictions on D). This provides a rigorous\nsymmetry argument which shows that P1 is allowed no matter how high the\nsymmetry of the atoms plus environment, and gives restrictions for all other\ncontributions.

The basic expression of DTD is a logistic map that\nties together energetic characteristics of the chemical transformation in the\nsystem, its deviation from true thermodynamic equilibrium, and the sum of\nthermodynamic forces, causing that deviation. System deviation from\nthermodynamic equilibrium is the major variable of the theory.

Further, 54% are hosted in interacting/merger\ngalaxies. Finally, we present both the average X-ray spectrum (0.1-10 keV) and\nlog N-log S in the 2-10 keV band. With our average spectrum, we have the\nremarkable result of reproducing the measured CXB X-ray power law slope of ~\n1.4 (Marshall et al. 1980). From the log N-log S relationship, we show that we\nare complete to log S < -11 in the 2-10 keV band. Both the collected X-ray\nproperties of our uniform sample and the log N-log S relationship will now\nprovide valuable input to X-ray background models for z ~ 0.

To search for new low-mass cluster members with disks, we have\nmeasured photometry for all sources in the Spitzer images and have identified\nthe ones that have red colors that are indicative of disks. We present 5\npromising candidates, which may consist of 2 brown dwarfs, 2 stars with edge-on\ndisks, and a low-mass protostar if they are bona fide members. Spectroscopy is\nneeded to verify the nature of these sources. We have also used the Spitzer\ndata to determine which of the previously known probable members of Sigma Ori\nare likely to have disks. By doing so, we measure disk fractions of ~40% and\n~60% for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, respectively. These results are\nsimilar to previous estimates of disk fractions in IC 348 and Cha I, which have\nroughly the same median ages as Sigma Ori (3 Myr). Finally, we note that our\nphotometric measurements and the sources that we identify as having disks\ndiffer significantly from those of other recent studies that analyzed the same\nSpitzer images. For instance, previous work has suggested that the T dwarf S\nOri 70 is redder than typical field dwarfs, which has been cited as possible\nevidence of youth and cluster membership. However, we find that this object is\nonly slightly redder than the reddest field dwarfs in [3.6]-[4.5] (1.56+/-0.07\nvs. 0.93-1.46). We measure a larger excess in [3.6]-[5.8] (1.75+/-0.21 vs.\n0.87-1.19), but the flux at 5.8um may be overestimated because of the low\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the detection. Thus, the Spitzer data do not offer\nstrong evidence of youth and membership for this object, which is the faintest\nand coolest candidate member of Sigma Ori that has been identified to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2008 17:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Having thus established a target list, we will use the multi-object\nIR spectrograph FLAMINGOS-2 on Gemini-South to carry out a spectroscopic survey\nof the candidate counterparts, to search for emission line signatures which are\na hallmark of accreting binaries. By determining the nature of these X-ray\nsources, this FLAMINGOS-2 Galactic Center Survey will have a dramatic impact on\nour knowledge of the Galactic accreting binary population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2008 22:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The resulting model predicts a wide\nrange of deformation behavior as a function of the initial conditions,\nincluding homogeneous deformation, broad shear bands, extremely thin shear\nbands, and the onset of material failure. In particular, the STZ model predicts\nhomogeneous deformation for shorter quench times and lower strain rates, and\ninhomogeneous deformation for longer quench times and higher strain rates. The\nlocation of the transition between homogeneous and inhomogeneous flow on the\ndeformation map is determined in part by the steady state effective\ntemperature, which is likely material dependent.

The conditional stellar mass\nfunction (CSMF), which describes the stellar distribution of galaxies in halos\nof a given mass for central and satellite galaxies can be well modeled with a\nlog-normal distribution and a modified Schechter form, respectively. On\naverage, there are about 3 times as many central galaxies as satellites. Among\nthe satellite population, there are in general more red galaxies than blue\nones. For the central population, the luminosity function is dominated by red\ngalaxies at the massive end, and by blue galaxies at the low mass end. At the\nvery low-mass end ($M_\\ast \\la 10^9 h^{-2}\\Msun$), however, there is a marked\nincrease in the number of red centrals.

For this purpose, we have compiled a\nlarge sample of 725 broad-line AGNs, which consists of 498 radio-loud sources\nand 227 radio-quiet sources. Our results are generally consistent with those in\nour previous work based on a smaller sample of 115 SDSS AGNs. We confirm that\nradio-loud objects have a steeper slope ($\\xi_{RX}$) in the radio-X-ray\nrelationship with respect to radio-quiet objects, and the dependence of the\nblack hole fundamental plane on the black hole mass ($\\xi_{RM}$) is weak. We\nalso find a tight correlation with a similar slope between the soft X-ray\nluminosity and broad emission line luminosity for both radio-loud and\nradio-quiet AGNs, which implies that their soft X-ray emission is unbeamed and\nprobably related to the accretion process. With the current larger sample of\nAGNs, we are able to study the redshift evolution of the black hole fundamental\nplane relation for both radio-loud and radio-quiet subsamples. We find that\nthere is no clear evidence of evolution for radio-quiet AGNs, while for\nradio-loud ones there is a weak trend where $\\xi_{RM}$ decreases as the\nredshift increases. This may be understood in part as due to the observed\nevolution of the radio spectral index as a function of redshift.

At lower mass flow rates\nor in stronger magnetic fields, efficient cyclotron cooling will cool the\nelectrons faster than the electrons can cool the ions and a two-temperature\nflow will result. Here we investigate the differences in polarized radiation\nexpected from mCV post-shock accretion columns modeled with one- and\ntwo-temperature hydrodynamics. In an mCV model with one accretion region, a\nmagnetic field >~30 MG and a specific mass flow rate of ~0.5 g/cm/cm/s, along\nwith a relatively generic geometric orientation of the system, we find that in\nthe ultraviolet either a single linear polarization pulse per binary orbit or\ntwo pulses per binary orbit can be expected, depending on the accretion column\nhydrodynamic structure (one- or two-temperature) modeled. Under conditions\nwhere the physical flow is two-temperature, one pulse per orbit is predicted\nfrom a single accretion region where a one-temperature model predicts two\npulses. The intensity light curves show similar pulse behavior but there is\nvery little difference between the circular polarization predictions of one-\nand two-temperature models. Such discrepancies indicate that it is important to\nmodel some aspect of two-temperature flow in indirect imaging procedures, like\nStokes imaging, especially at the edges of extended accretion regions, were the\nspecific mass flow is low, and especially for ultraviolet data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2008 06:46:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Flat rotation laws\nsuch as the quasi-Kepler law are unstable against the nonaxisymmetric\nstratorotational instability (SRI). The influence of a current-free toroidal\nmagnetic field depends on the magnetic Prandtl number Pm: SRI is supported by\nPm > 1 and it is suppressed by Pm \\lsim 1. For too flat rotation laws a smooth\ntransition exists to the instability which the toroidal magnetic field produces\nin combination with the differential rotation. This nonaxisymmetric azimuthal\nmagnetorotational instability (AMRI) has been computed under the presence of an\naxial density gradient. If the magnetic field between the cylinders is not\ncurrent-free then also the Tayler instability occurs and the transition from\nthe hydrodynamic SRI to the magnetic Tayler instability proves to be rather\ncomplex. Most spectacular is the `ballooning' of the stability domain by the\ndensity stratification: already a rather small rotation stabilizes magnetic\nfields against the Tayler instability. An azimuthal component of the resulting\nelectromotive force only exists for density-stratified flows.

In such a situation, physical properties will display, upon\ndecreasing temperature or energy, a dimensional crossover from two-dimensional\n(2d) to three-dimensional (3d) behavior, which is particularly interesting near\nquantum criticality. Here we study this crossover in thermodynamics using a\nsuitably generalized Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach to the critical behavior,\ncombined with renormalization group techniques. We focus on two experimentally\nrelevant cases: the crossover from a 2d to a 3d antiferromagnet, and the\ncrossover from a 2d ferromagnet to a 3d antiferromagnet. We discuss the\nlocation of phase boundary and crossover lines and determine the crossover\nfunctions for important thermodynamic quantities. As naive scaling does not\napply at and above the upper critical dimension, two crossover scales arise\nwhich can be associated with separate dimensional crossovers of classical and\nquantum fluctuations, respectively. In particular, we find an intermediate\nregime with novel power laws where the quantum fluctuations still have a 2d and\nthe classical fluctuations already have a 3d character. For the\nferromagnet-to-antiferromagnet crossover, the mismatch of the dynamical\nexponents between the 2d and 3d regimes leads to an even richer crossover\nstructure, with an interesting 2d non-critical regime sandwiched between two\ncritical regimes. For all cases, we find that thermal expansion and\ncompressibility are particularly sensitive probes of the dimensional crossover.\nFinally, we relate our results to experiments on the quantum critical\nheavy-fermion metals CeCu(6-x)Au(x), YbRh(2)Si(2) and CeCoIn(5).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2008 11:23:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2009 12:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We form PV images of the line ratios to get a global picture of the flow\nexcitation. We then apply a specialised diagnostic technique to find the\nelectron density, ionisation fraction, electron temperature and total density.\nOur results are in the form of PV maps of the obtained quantities, in which the\ngas behaviour is resolved as a function of both radial velocity and distance\nfrom the jet axis. They highlight a number of interesting physical features of\nthe jet collimation region, including regions of extremely high density,\nasymmetries with respect to the axis, and possible shock signatures. Finally,\nwe estimate the jet mass and angular momentum outflow rates, both of which are\nfundamental parameters in constraining models of accretion/ejection structures,\nparticularily if the parameters can be determined close to the jet footpoint.\nComparing mass flow rates for cases where the latter is available in the\nliterature (i.e. DG Tau, RW Aur and CW Tau) reveals a mass\nejection-to-accretion ratio of 0.01 - 0.07. Finally, where possible (i.e. DG\nTau and CW Tau), both mass and angular momentum outflow rates have been\nresolved into higher and lower velocity jet material. For the clearer case of\nDG Tau, this revealed that the more collimated higher velocity component plays\na dominant role in mass and angular momentum transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2008 11:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In one case, we found a new attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2008 13:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-06"}

In radio quiet quasars (RQQs) the relative radio\nemission is ~10^3 times weaker, and its origin is not established yet. We show\nhere that there is a strong correlation between the radio luminosity (L_R) and\nX-ray luminosity (L_X) with L_R~10^-5L_X, for the radio quiet Palomar-Green\n(PG) quasar sample. The sample is optically selected, with nearly complete\nradio and X-ray detections, and thus this correlation cannot be due to direct\nselection biases. The PG quasars lie on an extension of a similar correlation\nnoted by Panessa et al., for a small sample of nearby low luminosity type 1\nAGN. A remarkably similar correlation, known as the Guedel-Benz relation, where\nL_R/L_X~10^-5, holds for coronally active stars. The Guedel-Benz relation,\ntogether with correlated stellar X-ray and radio variability, implies that the\ncoronae are magnetically heated. We therefore raise the possibility that AGN\ncoronae are also magnetically heated, and that the radio emission in RQQ also\noriginates in coronal activity. If correct, then RQQ should generally display\ncompact flat cores at a few GHz due to synchrotron self-absorption, while at a\nfew hundred GHz we should be able to see directly the X-ray emitting corona,\nand relatively rapid and large amplitude variability, correlated with the X-ray\nvariability, is likely to be seen. We also discuss possible evidence that the\nradio and X-ray emission in ultra luminous X-ray sources and Galactic black\nholes may be of coronal origin as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2008 12:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the\ncase of H chemisorption or a vacancy, the gap does not decrease appreciably,\nwhereas it is substantially reduced in the case of a substitutional proton. The\npresence of an impurity invariably induces an increase of the density of states\nnear the HOMO level. We find a zero mode only in the case of a substitutional\nproton.

Data on symptoms\nreported by caregivers along with the cause of death are collected from a\nmedical facility, and the cause-of-death distribution is estimated in the\npopulation where only symptom data are available. Current approaches analyze\nonly one cause at a time, involve assumptions judged difficult or impossible to\nsatisfy, and require expensive, time-consuming, or unreliable physician\nreviews, expert algorithms, or parametric statistical models. By generalizing\ncurrent approaches to analyze multiple causes, we show how most of the\ndifficult assumptions underlying existing methods can be dropped. These\ngeneralizations also make physician review, expert algorithms and parametric\nstatistical assumptions unnecessary. With theoretical results, and empirical\nanalyses in data from China and Tanzania, we illustrate the accuracy of this\napproach. While no method of analyzing verbal autopsy data, including the more\ncomputationally intensive approach offered here, can give accurate estimates in\nall circumstances, the procedure offered is conceptually simpler, less\nexpensive, more general, as or more replicable, and easier to use in practice\nthan existing approaches. We also show how our focus on estimating aggregate\nproportions, which are the quantities of primary interest in verbal autopsy\nstudies, may also greatly reduce the assumptions necessary for, and thus\nimprove the performance of, many individual classifiers in this and other\nareas. As a companion to this paper, we also offer easy-to-use software that\nimplements the methods discussed herein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2008 13:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-06"}

The concrete form of the wave packages can be\nexpressed through some model functions and is defined by the local behavior of\nthe dispersive curves of the separate modes near to the corresponding special\npoints. The solution of this problem is possible with the help of the modified\nvariant of the special-time ray method offered by the authors (the method of\ngeometrical optics), the basic difference of which consists that the asymptotic\nrepresentation of the solution may be found in the form the series of the\nnon-integer degrees of some small parameter.

The obvious kind of the\nrepresentation is determined from the principle of the localness and the\nasymptotic behavior of the solution in the stationary and the\nhorizontally-homogeneous case.
