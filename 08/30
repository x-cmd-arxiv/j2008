We find that 43% of 171A EUV light\nthat enters TRACE is scattered, either through diffraction off the entrance\nfilter grid or through other nonspecular effects. We carry this result forward,\nvia known-PSF deconvolution of TRACE images, to identify its effect on analysis\nof TRACE data. Known-PSF deconvolution by this derived PSF greatly reduces the\neffect of visible haze in the TRACE 171A images, enhances bright features, and\nreveals that the smooth background component of the corona is considerably less\nbright (and hence much more rarefied) than commonly supposed. Deconvolution\nreveals that some prior conlclusions about the Sun appear to have been based on\nstray light in the images. In particular, the diffuse background \"quiet corona\"\nbecomes consistent with hydrostatic support of the coronal plasma; feature\ncontrast is greatly increased, possibly affecting derived parameters such as\nthe form of the coronal heating function; and essentially all existing\ndifferential emission measure studies of small features appear to be affected\nby contamination from nearby features. We speculate on further implications of\nstray light for interpretation of EUV images from TRACE and similar\ninstruments, and advocate deconvolution as a standard tool for image analysis\nwith future instruments such as SDO/AIA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2008 18:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Analytical\nrelations for the dependence of stature, measured mass (weight), growth\nvelocity (and their mix as the body mass index) on age are deduced with a set\nof common statistical parameters which could relate environmental, genetics and\nmetabolism and different aspects of physical growth on earth. A relationship to\nthe monotone smoothing using functional data analysis to estimate growth curves\nand its derivatives is established.

The idea is\nto sample a reconstruction sequence from a Boltzmann distribution associated\nwith an energy function that incorporates the distortion between the source and\nreconstruction, the compressibility of the reconstruction, and the point sought\non the rate-distortion curve. To sample from this distribution, we use a `heat\nbath algorithm': Starting from an initial candidate reconstruction (say the\noriginal source sequence), at every iteration, an index i is chosen and the\ni-th sequence component is replaced by drawing from the conditional probability\ndistribution for that component given all the rest. At the end of this process,\nthe encoder conveys the reconstruction to the decoder using universal lossless\ncompression. The complexity of each iteration is independent of the sequence\nlength and only linearly dependent on a certain context parameter (which grows\nsub-logarithmically with the sequence length). We show that the proposed\nalgorithms achieve optimum rate-distortion performance in the limits of large\nnumber of iterations, and sequence length, when employed on any stationary\nergodic source. Experimentation shows promising initial results. Employing our\nlossy compressors on noisy data, with appropriately chosen distortion measure\nand level, followed by a simple de-randomization operation, results in a family\nof denoisers that compares favorably (both theoretically and in practice) with\nother MCMC-based schemes, and with the Discrete Universal Denoiser (DUDE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2008 19:23:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 18:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

We detect strong radio\nemission, dominated by short-duration periodic pulses at 4.86 GHz with\nP=124.32+/-0.11 min. The stability of the pulse profiles and arrival times\ndemonstrates that they are due to the rotational modulation of a B~1.7 kG\nmagnetic field. A quiescent non-variable component is also detected, likely due\nto emission from a uniform large-scale field. The H-alpha emission exhibits\nidentical periodicity, but unlike the radio pulses it varies sinusoidally and\nis offset by exactly 1/4 of a phase. The sinusoidal variations require\nchromospheric emission from a large-scale field structure, with the radio\npulses likely emanating from the magnetic poles. While both light curves can be\nexplained by a rotating mis-aligned magnetic field, the 1/4 phase lag rules out\na symmetric dipole topology since it would result in a phase lag of 1/2\n(poloidal field) or zero (toroidal field). We therefore conclude that either\n(i) the field is dominated by a quadrupole configuration, which can naturally\nexplain the 1/4 phase lag; or (ii) the H-alpha and/or radio emission regions\nare not trivially aligned with the field.

It is a legitimate question to ask how human brain can receive subtle\nexternal visual quantum information intact when it must pass through very noisy\nand complex pathways from the eye to the brain? There are several approaches to\ninvestigate information processing in the brain, each of which presents a\ndifferent set of conclusions. Penrose and Hameroff have hypothesized that there\nis quantum information processing inside the human brain whose material\nsubstrate involves microtubules and consciousness is the result of a collective\nwavefunction collapse occurring in these structures. Conversely, Tegmark stated\nthat owing to thermal decoherence there cannot be any quantum processing in\nneurons of the brain and processing in the brain must be classical for\ncognitive processes. However, Rosa and Faber presented an argument for a middle\nway which shows that none of the previous authors are completely right and\ndespite the presence of decoherence, it is still possible to consider the brain\nto be a quantum system. Additionally, Thaheld, has concluded that quantum\nstates of photons do collapse in the human eye and there is no possibility for\ncollapse of visual quantum states in the brain and thus there is no possibility\nfor the quantum state reduction in the brain. In this paper we conclude that if\nwe accept the main essence of the above approaches taken together, each of them\ncan provide a different part of a teleportation mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2008 20:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2008 18:00:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2010 23:51:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2010 15:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-14"}

The detection\nof such oscillations for a star offers a very good opportunity to determine the\nstage of its nuclear evolution, and hence its age. In this context, we\ninvestigate the Sun and alpha Cen A and B. For alpha Cen A and B, each of the\nsmall separations delta nu 01, delta nu 02 and delta nu 13 gives a different\nage. Therefore, in our fitting process, we also employ the second difference,\ndefined as nu n2 - 2 nu n1 + nu n0, which is 2 delta nu 01- delta nu 02. In\naddition to this, we also use frequency ratio (nu n0/ nu n2). For the Sun,\nthese expressions areequivalent and give an age of about 4.9-5.0 Gyr. For alpha\nCen A and B, however, the small separation and the second difference give very\ndifferent ages. This conflict may be solved by the detection of oscillation\nfrequencies that can be measured much more precisely than the current\nfrequencies.

Although it is notoriously difficult to derive\ngeneral end-to-end capacity results for multi-terminal or \\adhoc networks, the\ntransmission capacity (TC) framework allows for quantification of achievable\nsingle-hop rates by focusing on a simplified physical/MAC-layer model. By using\nstochastic geometry to quantify the multi-user interference in the network, the\nrelationship between the optimal spatial density and success probability of\ntransmissions in the network can be determined, and expressed -- often fairly\nsimply -- in terms of the key network parameters. The basic model and\nanalytical tools are first discussed and applied to a simple network with path\nloss only and we present tight upper and lower bounds on transmission capacity\n(via lower and upper bounds on outage probability). We then introduce random\nchannels (fading/shadowing) and give TC and outage approximations for an\narbitrary channel distribution, as well as exact results for the special cases\nof Rayleigh and Nakagami fading.

Without loss of generality, we will focus our attention on\nturbo multiuser detection, to facilitate a more concrete discussion. It is\nshown that, with some loss of optimality, variational inference avoids the\nexponential complexity of a posteriori probability (APP) detection by\noptimizing a closely-related, but much more manageable, objective function\ncalled variational free energy. In addition to its systematic appeal, there are\nseveral other advantages to this viewpoint. First of all, it provides unified\nand rigorous justifications for numerous detectors that were proposed on\nradically different grounds, and facilitates convenient joint detection and\ndecoding (utilizing the turbo principle) when error-control codes are\nincorporated. Secondly, efficient joint parameter estimation and data detection\nis possible via the variational expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, such\nthat the detrimental effect of inaccurate channel knowledge at the receiver may\nbe dealt with systematically. We are also able to extend BPSK-based SISO\ndetection schemes to arbitrary square QAM constellations in a rigorous manner\nusing a variational argument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Aug 2008 01:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-23"}
