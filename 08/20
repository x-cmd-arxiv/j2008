Furthermore, it has also been noted that the effects of\nchanneling may enable a WIMP that scatters elastically via spin-independent\ninteractions from nuclei to produce the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA without\nexceeding the limits placed by CDMS, XENON, CRESST, CoGeNT and other\ndirect-detection experiments. To accommodate this signal, however, the mass of\nthe responsible dark-matter particle must be relatively light, m_{DM} \\lsim 10\nGeV. Such dark-matter particles will become captured by and annihilate in the\nSun at very high rates, leading to a potentially large flux of GeV-scale\nneutrinos. We calculate the neutrino spectrum resulting from WIMP annihilations\nin the Sun and show that existing limits from Super-Kamiokande can be used to\nclose a significant portion of the DAMA region, especially if the dark-matter\nparticles produce tau leptons or neutrinos in a sizable fraction of their\nannihilations. We also determine the spin-dependent WIMP-nuclei\nelastic-scattering parameter space consistent with DAMA. The constraints from\nSuper-Kamiokande on the spin-dependent scenario are even more severe--they\nexclude any self-annihilating WIMP in the DAMA region that annihilates 1% of\nthe time or more to any combination of neutrinos, tau leptons, or charm or\nbottom quarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2008 16:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-26"}

We develop a simple model for the evolution across the L/T\ntransition.

We focus on near infrared color-\nmagnitude diagrams (CMDs) and on the nature of the ``second parameter'' that is\nresponsible for the scatter of colors along the Teff sequence. Variations in\nmetallicity and cloud parameters, unresolved binaries and possibly a relatively\nyoung population all play a role in defining the spread of brown dwarfs along\nthe cooling sequence.

We\napply the same model to the Pleiades brown dwarf sequence. Taken at face value,\nthe Pleiades data suggest that the L/T transition occurs at lower Teff for\nlower gravity objects. The simulated populations of brown dwarfs also reveal\nthat the phase of deuterium burning produces a distinctive feature in CMDs that\nshould be detectable in ~50-100 Myr old clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2008 19:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The point of\ntransition defines a point on the edge of chaos. Since it is defined via the\nlifetimes, the edge of chaos can also be used in situations when the turbulence\nis not persistent.

We find a tight relation\nto z=3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small,\nand blue galaxies being large. We show that the relation is driven by stellar\nsurface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surface\ndensity are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies with\nlow surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates.\nSurface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated with\nspecific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. Hence stellar mass by\nitself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. In\ngeneral, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific star\nformation rates at higher redshift. Specifically, galaxies with a surface\ndensity of 1-3 10^9 Msun/kpc^2 are \"red and dead\" at low redshift,\napproximately 50% are forming stars at z=1, and almost all are forming stars by\nz=2. This provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution of\ngalaxies onto the red sequence. The sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolve\nlike 1/(1+z)^(0.59 +- 0.10). Hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing in\ntheir history. The size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies, and\nquiescent galaxies. The persistence of the structural relations from z=0 to\nz=2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to the\nHubble sequence exists out to z=2.5, and possibly beyond. The star forming\ngalaxies at z >= 1.5 are quite different from star forming galaxies at z=0, as\nthey have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation time scales\ncomparable to the orbital time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2008 20:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In particular, for anharmonic oscillator\nsystems such as the superconducting phase qubit and the transmon a two-level\napproximation is insufficient. We apply optimal control theory to the envelope\nof a resonant Rabi pulse in a qubit in the presence of a single, weakly\noff-resonant leakage level. The gate error of a spin flip operation reduces by\norders of magnitude compared to simple pulse shapes. Near-perfect gates can be\nachieved for any pulse duration longer than an intrinsic limit given by the\nnonlinearity. The pulses can be understood as composite sequences that refocus\nthe leakage transition. We also discuss ways to improve the pulse shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2008 01:19:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-22"}

We find that the non-equilibrium\nrelaxation, beginning with random initial states quenched to low temperatures,\nexhibits a three-stage relaxation of chirality autocorrelations. At the early\nstage, the relaxation is found to be described by the von Schweidler form. Then\nit exhibits power-law behavior in the intermediate time scale and faster decay\nin the long-time limit, which together can be fitted to the Ogielski form; for\nlonger waiting times, this crosses over to a stretched exponential form. We\nargue that the power-law behavior in the intermediate time scale may be\nunderstood as a consequence of the coarsening behavior, leading to the local\nvortex order corresponding to f=2/5 ground-state configurations. High mobility\nof the vortices in the domain boundaries, generating slow wandering motion of\nthe domain walls, may provide mechanism of dynamic heterogeneity and account\nfor the long-time stretched exponential relaxation behavior.

They however failed to predict the bright EUV warm loops\npermeating ARs: the synthetic images were dominated by intense footpoint\nemission. We demonstrate that this failure is due to the very weak dependence\nof loop temperature on loop length which cannot simultaneously account for both\nhot and warm loops in the same AR. We then consider time-dependent AR models\nbased on nanoflare heating. We demonstrate that such models can simultaneously\nreproduce EUV and SXR loops in ARs. Moreover, they predict radial intensity\nvariations consistent with the localized core and extended emissions in SXR and\nEUV AR observations respectively. We finally show how the AR morphology can be\nused as a gauge of the properties (duration, energy, spatial dependence,\nrepetition time) of the impulsive heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2008 13:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In fission yeast for example, polarized growth sites are organized\nby actin whereas microtubules (MT) acting upstream control where growth occurs\n(La Carbona et al, 2006). Growth is limited to the cell poles when MTs undergo\ncatastrophes there and not elsewhere on the cortex (Brunner and Nurse, 2000).\nHere we report that the modulation of MT dynamics by forces as observed in\nvitro (Dogterom and Yurke, 1997; Janson et al, 2003) can quantitatively explain\nthe localization of MT catastro-phes in S. pombe. However, we found that it is\nnecessary to add length-dependent catastrophe rates to make the model fully\nconsistent with other measured traits of MTs. This result demonstrates the\npossibility that MTs together with associated proteins such as kinesins having\na depolymerization activity can reliably mark the tips of the cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2008 09:22:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 16:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-30"}

The manifestation of such\na phonon-plasmon scenario based on a nonadiabatic charge response is\nquantitatively supported by a realistic calculation of the frequency and\nwavevector dependent irreducible polarization part of the density response\nfunction. The latter is used within linear response theory to calculate the\ncoupled mode dispersion in the main symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone\nand the charge density redistributions excited by certain strongly coupling\nphonon-like and plasmon-like modes. Moreover, the corresponding mode induced\norbital averaged changes of the selfconsistent potential felt by the electrons\nare assessed. Our analysis should be representative for the optimally to\noverdoped state of the cuprates where experimental evidence of a coherent\nthree-dimensional Fermi surface and a coherent c-axis charge transport is\ngiven. It is demonstrated that modes from the outside of a small region around\nthe c-axis can reliably be calculated within the adiabatic limit. Only a minor\nnonadiabatic correction is found for these modes in form of stiffening of the\nhigh-frequency oxygen-bond-stretching mode at the X-point which is attributed\nto dynamical reduced nesting. On the other hand, modes inside the nonadiabatic\nsector of the BZ have to be determined nonadiabatically owing to the poor\ndynamical screening of the long-ranged Coulomb interaction around the c-axis by\nthe slow charge dynamics. In particular, the relevance of the strongly coupling\nphonon-like apex oxygen $Z$-point breathing mode at about 40 meV is emphasized\nwhose mode energy decreases with less doping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2008 14:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2008 13:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-12"}
