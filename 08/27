Although the\nframework is similar as the one in Part I \\cite{myself3}, dealing with the slow\nfading requires more intricate techniques. Unlike in the fast fading scenario,\nwhere the frames supporting the transmission of the codewords were equivalent\nand completely characterized by the channel statistics, in our present scenario\nthe frames are unique, and characterized by a specific set of channel\nrealizations. This leads to more involved inter-frame power allocation\nstrategies, and in some cases even to the need for a third level of power\ncontrol. We also show that for parallel slow fading channels, the CSI feedback\nhelps in the battle against jamming, as evidenced by the significant\ndegradation to system performance when CSI is not sent back. We expect this\ndegradation to decrease as the number of parallel channels $M$ increases, until\nit becomes marginal for $M\\to \\infty$ (which can be considered as the case in\nPart I).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2008 18:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-27"}

Both transmitter and\njammer are subject to power constraints which can be enforced over each\ncodeword short-term / peak) or over all codewords (long-term / average), hence\ngenerating different scenarios. All our jamming problems are formulated as\nzero-sum games, having the probability of outage as pay-off function and power\ncontrol functions as strategies. The paper aims at providing a comprehensive\ncoverage of these problems, under fast and slow fading, peak and average power\nconstraints, pure and mixed strategies, with and without channel state\ninformation (CSI) feedback. In this first part we study the fast fading\nscenario. We first assume full CSI to be available to all parties. For peak\npower constraints, a Nash equilibrium of pure strategies is found. For average\npower constraints, both pure and mixed strategies are investigated. With pure\nstrategies, we derive the optimal power control functions for both intra-frame\nand inter-frame power allocation. Maximin and minimax solutions are found and\nshown to be different, which implies the non-existence of a saddle point. In\naddition we provide alternative perspectives in obtaining the optimal\nintra-frame power control functions under the long-term power constraints. With\nmixed strategies, the Nash equilibrium is found by solving the generalized form\nof an older problem dating back to Bell and Cover \\cite{bell}. Finally, we\nderive a Nash equilibrium of the game in which no CSI is fed back from the\nreceiver. We show that full channel state information brings only a very slight\nimprovement in the system's performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2008 18:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-27"}

This forms\nthe basis of a pilot study testing the feasibility of using FFS to measure the\nvelocity dispersions of several clusters simultaneously, in order to determine\ntheir dynamical masses; Methods: We adopted two methods for determining the\nvelocity dispersion of the star clusters: cross-correlating the cluster\nspectrum with the template spectra and minimising a chi^2 value between the\ncluster spectrum and the broadened template spectra. Cluster 805 in M83 was\nchosen as a control to test the reliability of the method, through a comparison\nwith the results obtained from a standard echelle VLT/UVES spectrum obtained by\nLarsen & Richtler; Results: We find no dependence of the velocity dispersions\nmeasured for a cluster on the choice of red giant versus red supergiant\ntemplates, nor on the method adopted. We measure a velocity dispersion of\nsigma_los = 10.2+/-1.1 km/s for cluster 805 from our FFS. Our FLAMES+UVES\nvelocity dispersion measurement gives M_vir = (6.6+/-1.7)e5 M_sun, consistent\nwith previous results.

However, based on\nits effective star formation efficiency, the cluster is likely to virialise,\nand may survive for a Hubble time, in the absence of external disruptive\nforces; Conclusions: We find that reliable velocity dispersions can be\ndetermined from FFS.

Subsequent observations showed that this\nEDIG (extended or extraplanar diffuse interstellar gas) has rotation velocities\napproximately 10-20% lower than those in the central plane, and have been hard\nto account for. Here we present results of hydrodynamic models, with radiative\ncooling and heating from star formation. We find that in models with star\nformation generated stochastically across the disc an extraplanar gas layer is\ngenerated as long as the star formation is sufficiently strong. However, this\ngas rotates at nearly the same speed as the mid-plane gas. We then studied a\nrange of models with imposed spiral or bar waves in the disc. EDIG layers were\nalso generated in these models, but primarily over the wave regions, not over\nthe entire disc. Because of this partial coverage, the EDIG clouds move\nradially, as well as vertically, with the result that observed kinematic\nanomalies are reproduced. The implication is that the kinematic anomalies are\nthe result of three-dimensional motions when the cylindrical symmetry of the\ndisc is broken. Thus, the kinematic anomalies are the result of bars or strong\nwaves, and more face-on galaxies with such waves should have an asymmetric EDIG\ncomponent. The models also indicate that the EDIG can contain a significant\nfraction of cool gas, and that some star formation can be triggered at\nconsiderable heights above the disc midplane.

Instead of taking periodic\nsamples, CS measures inner products with M < N random vectors and then recovers\nthe signal via a sparsity-seeking optimization or greedy algorithm. Standard CS\ndictates that robust signal recovery is possible from M = O(K log(N/K))\nmeasurements. It is possible to substantially decrease M without sacrificing\nrobustness by leveraging more realistic signal models that go beyond simple\nsparsity and compressibility by including structural dependencies between the\nvalues and locations of the signal coefficients. This paper introduces a\nmodel-based CS theory that parallels the conventional theory and provides\nconcrete guidelines on how to create model-based recovery algorithms with\nprovable performance guarantees. A highlight is the introduction of a new class\nof structured compressible signals along with a new sufficient condition for\nrobust structured compressible signal recovery that we dub the restricted\namplification property, which is the natural counterpart to the restricted\nisometry property of conventional CS.

Most of the disc\nsimulations have assumed a small initial magnetic field and studied the\nturbulence that arises from the magnetorotational instability. However, gaseous\ndiscs in galactic nuclei and in some binary systems are likely to have\nsignificant initial magnetisation. Motivated by this, we performed ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of strongly magnetised, vertically stratified\ndiscs in a Keplerian potential. Our initial equilibrium configuration, which\nhas an azimuthal magnetic field in equipartion with thermal pressure, is\nunstable to the Parker instability. This leads to the expelling of magnetic\nfield arcs, anchored in the midplane of the disc, to around five scale heights\nfrom the midplane. Transition to turbulence happens primarily through\nmagnetorotational instability in the resulting vertical fields, although\nmagnetorotational shear instability in the unperturbed azimuthal field plays a\nsignificant role as well, especially in the midplane where buoyancy is weak.\nHigh magnetic and hydrodynamical stresses arise, yielding an effective\n$\\alpha$-value of around 0.1 in our highest resolution run. Azimuthal magnetic\nfield expelled by magnetic buoyancy from the disc is continuously replenished\nby the stretching of a radial field created as gas parcels slide in the linear\ngravity field along inclined magnetic field lines. This dynamo process, where\nthe bending of field lines by the Parker instability leads to re-creation of\nthe azimuthal field, implies that highly magnetised discs are astrophysically\nviable and that they have high accretion rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2008 20:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The method\nof using the infrared regime to convert single-lined spectra into double-lined\nspectra, and derive the mass ratio for the binary system, has been successfully\nused for a number of young, low-mass binaries. For RX J0529.3+1210, a long-\nperiod(462 days) and highly eccentric(0.88) binary system, we determine the\nmass ratio to be 0.78+/-0.05 using the infrared double-lined velocity data\nalone, and 0.73+/-0.23 combining visible light and infrared data in a full\norbital solution. The large uncertainty in the latter is the result of the\nsparse sampling in the infrared and the high eccentricity: the stars do not\nhave a large velocity separation during most of their ~1.3 year orbit. A mass\nratio close to unity, consistent with the high end of the one sigma uncertainty\nfor this mass ratio value, is inconsistent with the lack of a visible light\ndetection of the secondary component. We outline several scenarios for a color\ndifference in the two stars, such as one heavily spotted component, higher\norder multiplicity, or a unique evolutionary stage, favoring detection of only\nthe primary star in visible light, even in a mass ratio ~1 system. However, the\nevidence points to a lower ratio. Although RX J0529.3+1210 exhibits no excess\nat near-infrared wavelengths, a small 24 micron excess is detected, consistent\nwith circumbinary dust.

Blowing-up of the orbifold is described by a Higgs\neffect and the results are consistent with the corresponding ones obtained for\nsmooth G2 spaces.

Our method, based on a principal component analysis (PCA), can\nbe applied in a consistent way to spectra drawn from local galaxy surveys and\nfrom surveys at $z \\sim 1$, and is only weakly influenced by attenuation due to\ndust. We apply our method to galaxy samples drawn from SDSS and DEEP2 to study\nmass-dependent growth of galaxies from $z \\sim 1$ to $z \\sim 0$. We find that,\n(1) high mass galaxies have lower SSFRs than low mass galaxies; (2) the average\nSSFR has decreased from $z=1$ to $z=0$ by a factor of $\\sim 3-4$, independent\nof galaxy mass. Additionally, at $z \\sim 1$ our average SSFRs are a factor of\n$2-2.5$ lower than those derived from multi-wavelength photometry using similar\ndatasets. We then compute the average time (in units of the Hubble time,\n$t_{\\rm H}(z)$) needed by galaxies of a given mass to form their stars at their\ncurrent rate. At both $z=0$ and at $z=1$, this timescale decreases strongly\nwith stellar mass from values close to unity for galaxies with masses $\\sim\n10^{10} M_{\\odot}$, to more than ten for galaxies more massive than $ 10^{11}\nM_{\\odot}$. Our results are in good agreement with models in which AGN feedback\nis more efficient at preventing gas from cooling and forming stars in high mass\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2008 13:44:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 03:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In these cases it is required to convert\nirregularly sampled signals to regularly sampled ones or to restore missing\ndata. In this paper, we address this problem in a framework of a discrete\nsampling theorem for band-limited discrete signals that have a limited number\nof non-zero transform coefficients in a certain transform domain. Conditions\nfor the image unique recovery, from sparse samples, are formulated and then\nanalyzed for various transforms. Applications are demonstrated on examples of\nimage super-resolution and image reconstruction from sparse projections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2008 15:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
