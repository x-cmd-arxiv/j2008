Irreversible\nchanges of their configuration lead to a training effect. This is directly seen\nas a change in the magnetic half order Bragg peaks after magnetization\nreversal. A 30 nm size of antiferromagnetic domains is extracted from the width\nthe (1/2 1/2 1/2) antiferromagnetic magnetic peak measured both by neutron and\nx-ray scattering. A reduced blocking temperature as compared to the measured\nantiferromagnetic ordering temperature clearly corresponds to the blocking of\nantiferromagnetic domains. Moreover, an excellent correlation between the size\nof the antiferromagnetic domains, exchange bias field and frozen-in spin ratio\nis found, providing a comprehensive understanding of the origin of exchange\nbias in epitaxial systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2008 17:34:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2008 00:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

One of these is a lack of large-scale\npower. Because the data otherwise match standard models extremely well, it is\nnatural to consider perturbations of the standard model as possible\nexplanations. We show that, as long as the source of the perturbation is\nstatistically independent of the source of the primary CMB anisotropy, no such\nmodel can explain this large-scale power deficit. On the contrary, any such\nperturbation always reduces the probability of obtaining any given low value of\nlarge-scale power. We rigorously prove this result when the lack of large-scale\npower is quantified with a quadratic statistic, such as the quadrupole moment.\nWhen a statistic based on the integrated square of the correlation function is\nused instead, we present strong numerical evidence in support of the result.\nThe result applies to models in which the geometry of spacetime is perturbed\n(e.g., an ellipsoidal Universe) as well as explanations involving local\ncontaminants, undiagnosed foregrounds, or systematic errors. Because the\nlarge-scale power deficit is arguably the most significant of the observed\nanomalies, explanations that worsen this discrepancy should be regarded with\ngreat skepticism, even if they help in explaining other anomalies such as\nmultipole alignments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2008 19:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

When proposing a\nnew technique for software maintenance, effective tool support is typically\nrequired to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.\nHowever, even though tool building is both pervasive and requiring significant\ntime and effort, it is still pursued in an ad hoc manner. In this paper, we\naddress these issues by proposing a dedicated development process for tool\nbuilding that takes the unique characteristics of an academic research\nenvironment into account. We first identify process requirements based on a\nreview of the literature and our extensive tool building experience in the\ndomain of maintenance tools.

The work products are concrete milestones of the process,\ntracking progress, rationalizing (design) decisions, and documenting the\ncurrent state of the tool building project. Thus, the work products provide\nimportant input for strategic project decisions and rapid initiation of new\nteam members.

Our criteria include the strengths of the 3.3\nmicron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features and the optical\ndepths of absorption features at 3.1 micron due to ice-covered dust grains and\nat 3.4 micron from bare carbonaceous dust grains. Because of the AKARI IRC's\nspectroscopic capability in the full 2.5-5 micron wavelength range, unaffected\nby Earth's atmosphere, we can apply this energy diagnostic method to ULIRGs at\nz > 0.15. We estimate the intrinsic luminosities of extended (several kpc),\nmodestly obscured (Av < 15 mag) starburst activity based on the 3.3 micron PAH\nemission luminosities measured in AKARI IRC slitless spectra, and confirm that\nsuch starbursts are energetically unimportant in nearby ULIRGs. In roughly half\nof the observed ULIRGs classified optically as non-Seyferts, we find signatures\nof luminous energy sources that produce no PAH emission and/or are more\ncentrally concentrated than the surrounding dust.

Our overall results\nsupport the scenario that luminous buried AGNs are important in many ULIRGs at\nz < 0.3 classified optically as non-Seyferts, and that the optical\nundetectability of such buried AGNs occurs merely because of a large amount of\nnuclear dust, which can make the sightline of even the lowest dust column\ndensity opaque to the ionizing radiation of the AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2008 00:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

We resolve the HCN (3-2) emission and find that it is\ncentrally peaked and has a roughly spherically symmetrical distribution.

The view-point of renewal theory\nis assumed. In order to represent market data with relatively long durations,\ntwo types of distributions are used, namely, a distribution derived from the\nso-called Mittag-Leffler survival function and the Weibull distribution. For\nMittag-Leffler type distribution, the average waiting time (residual life time)\nis strongly dependent on the choice of a cut-off parameter t_ max, whereas the\nresults based on the Weibull distribution do not depend on such a cut-off.\nTherefore, a Weibull distribution is more convenient than a Mittag-Leffler type\none if one wishes to evaluate relevant statistics such as average waiting time\nin financial markets with long durations. On the other side, we find that the\nGini index is rather independent of the cut-off parameter. Based on the above\nconsiderations, we propose a good candidate for describing the distribution of\nfirst-passage time in a market: The Weibull distribution with a power-law tail.\nThis distribution compensates the gap between theoretical and empirical results\nmuch more efficiently than a simple Weibull distribution. We also give a useful\nformula to determine an optimal crossover point minimizing the difference\nbetween the empirical average waiting time and the one predicted from renewal\ntheory. Moreover, we discuss the limitation of our distributions by applying\nour distribution to the analysis of the BTP future and calculating the average\nwaiting time.

We want to better understand the behavior of solar\ngranulation as a function of the observing height in the solar atmosphere and\nwith magnetic activity during solar cycle 23. We analyze the Power Spectral\nDensity (PSD) of eleven years of GOLF/SOHO velocity-time series using a\nHarvey-type model to characterize the properties of the convective motions in\nthe solar oscillation power spectrum. We study then the evolution of the\ngranulation with the altitude in the solar atmosphere and with the solar\nactivity. First, we show that the traditional use of a lorentzian profile to\nfit the envelope of the p modes is not well suitable for GOLF data.

We find\nthat, contrary to the steady state, the transient dynamics of the system\ndepends sensitively on the bandwidth of the electrode material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2008 13:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 10:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-11"}

The nuclei of the three sources appear to have\ndifferent relative contributions of accretion- and jet-related X-ray emission,\nas expected based on earlier work. The X-ray spectrum of the FRII narrow-line\nradio galaxy (NLRG) 4C 73.08 is modeled with the sum of a heavily absorbed\npower law that we interpret to be associated with a luminous accretion disk and\ncircumnuclear obscuring structure, and an unabsorbed power law that originates\nin an unresolved jet. This behavior is consistent with other narrow-line radio\ngalaxies. The X-ray emission of the low-excitation FRII radio galaxy DA 240 is\nbest modeled as an unabsorbed power law that we associate with a parsec-scale\njet, similar to other low-excitation sources that we have studied previously.\nHowever, the X-ray nucleus of the narrow-line radio galaxy 3C 305 shows no\nevidence for the heavily absorbed X-ray emission that has been found in other\nNLRGs. It is possible that the nuclear optical spectrum in 3C 305 is\nintrinsically weak-lined, with the strong emission arising from extended\nregions that indicate the presence of jet--environment interactions. Our\nobservations of 3C 305 suggest that this source is more closely related to\nother weak-lined radio galaxies. This ambiguity could extend to other sources\ncurrently classified as NLRGs.
