The intrinsic errors include\ndiffraction effects on the pyramid edges and detector read out noise. The\nexternal imperfections consist of a Gaussian profile in the intensity\ndistribution in the pupil plane during calibration, the effect of an optically\nresolved reference source, and noncommon-path aberrations. We investigated the\neffect of three differently sized reference sources on the calibration of the\nPWFS. For the noncommon-path aberrations the quality of the response of the\nsystem is quantified in terms of modal cross talk and aliasing. We investigate\nthe special behavior of the system regarding tip-tilt control. From our\nmeasurements we derive the method to optimize the calibration procedure and the\nsetup of a PWFS adaptive optics (AO) system. We also calculate the total\nwavefront error arising from aliasing, modal cross talk, measurement error, and\nfitting error in order to optimize the number of calibrated modes for on-sky\noperations.

Using this, we show that every\n$n$-vertex graph of genus $g$ and maximum degree $d$ satisfies $\\lambda_2(G) =\nO((g+1)^3 d/n)$. This recovers the $O(d/n)$ bound of Spielman and Teng for\nplanar graphs, and compares to Kelner's bound of $O((g+1) poly(d)/n)$, but our\nproof does not make use of conformal mappings or circle packings. We are thus\nable to extend this to resolve positively a conjecture of Spielman and Teng, by\nproving that $\\lambda_2(G) = O(d h^6 \\log h/n)$ whenever $G$ is $K_h$-minor\nfree. This shows, in particular, that spectral partitioning can be used to\nrecover $O(\\sqrt{n})$-sized separators in bounded degree graphs that exclude a\nfixed minor.

We answer the question affirmatively for\nextremely general corruption patterns: we only request that the topology of the\nnetwork and the corruption pattern of the adversary leaves at least one path\neach round connecting the sender and receiver through honest nodes (though this\npath may change at every round). Out construction works in the public-key\nsetting and enjoys bounded memory per processor (that does not depend on the\namount of traffic and is polynomial in the network size.) Our protocol achieves\noptimal transfer rate with negligible decoding error.

We show that, much like its regular\ncounterpart of M=N, the theory at planar limit have integrability structure in\nthe conformal dimension spectrum of single trace operators. We first revisit\nthe Yang-Baxter equation for a spin chain system associated with the single\ntrace operators. We show that the integrability by itself does not preclude\nparity symmetry breaking. We construct two-parameter family of parity\nnon-invariant, alternating spin chain Hamiltonian involving three-site\ninteractions between 4 and 4* of SU(4). At weak `t Hooft coupling, we study the\nChern-Simons theory perturbatively and calculate anomalous dimension of single\ntrace operators up to two loops. The computation is essentially parallel to the\nregular case M=N. We find that resulting spin chain Hamiltonian matches with\nthe Hamiltonian derived from Yang-Baxter equation, but to the one preserving\nparity symmetry. We give several intuitive explanations why the parity symmetry\nbreaking is not detected in the Chern-Simons spin chain Hamiltonian at\nperturbative level. We suggest that open spin chain, associated with open\nstring excitations on giant gravitons or dibaryons, can detect discrete flat\nholonomy and hence parity symmetry breaking through boundary field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2008 18:52:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2008 23:45:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2008 11:24:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2008 09:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-02"}

Our goal is to improve our\nunderstanding of UV excess in the regime of both massive GCs and ultra-compact\ndwarf galaxies (UCDs). To this end, we use deep archival GALEX data of the\ncentral Fornax cluster to measure NUV and FUV magnitudes of UCDs and massive\nGCs. We obtain NUV photometry for a sample of 35 compact objects with\n-13.5<M_V<-10 mag. Of those, 21 objects also have FUV photometry. Roughly half\nof the sources fall into the UCD luminosity regime (M_V <=-11 mag). We find\nthat seven out of 17 massive Fornax GCs exhibit a NUV excess with respect to\nexpectations from stellar population models, even for models with enhanced\nHelium abundance. This suggests that not only He-enrichment has contributed to\nforming the EHB population of these GCs. The GCs extend to stronger UV excess\nthan GCs in M31 and massive GCs in M87, at the 97% confidence level. Most of\nthe UCDs with FUV photometry also show evidence for UV excess, but their UV\ncolours can be matched by isochrones with enhanced Helium abundances and old\nages 12-14 Gyrs. We find that Fornax compact objects with X-ray emission\ndetected from Chandra images are almost disjunct in colour from compact objects\nwith GALEX UV detection, with only one X-ray source among the 35 compact\nobjects. However, since this source is one of the three most UV bright GCs, we\ncannot exclude that the physical processes causing X-ray emission also\ncontribute to some of the observed UV excess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2008 20:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Contrary to conventional microscopy with incoherent light, which\ngives morphological information only, diffraction microtomography makes it\npossible to obtain the complex optical refractive index of the observed sample\nby mapping a three-dimensional support in the spatial frequency domain. The\ntechnique can be implemented in two configurations, namely, by varying the\nsample illumination with a fixed sample or by rotating the sample using a fixed\nillumination. In the literature, only the former method was described in\ndetail. In this report, we precisely derive the three-dimensional frequency\nsupport that can be mapped by the sample rotation configuration. We found that,\nwithin the first-order Born approximation, the volume of the frequency domain\nthat can be mapped exhibits a missing part, the shape of which resembles that\nof an apple core. The projection of the diffracted waves in the frequency space\nonto the set of sphere caps covered by the sample rotation does not allow for a\ncomplete mapping of the frequency along the axis of rotation due to the finite\nradius of the sphere caps.

One such difficulty is the\ncusp/core problem. High resolution observations of the rotation curves for dark\nmatter dominated low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies imply that galactic dark\nmatter halos have a density profile with a flat central core, whereas N-body\nstructure formation simulations predict a divergent (cuspy) density profile at\nthe center. It has been proposed that this problem can be resolved by stellar\nfeedback driving turbulent gas motion that erases the initial cusp. However,\nstrong gravitational lensing prefers a cuspy density profile for galactic\nhalos. In this paper, we use the most recent high resolution observations of\nthe rotation curves of LSB galaxies to fit the core size as a function of halo\nmass, and compare the resultant lensing probability to the observational\nresults for the well defined combined sample of the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey\n(CLASS) and Jodrell Bank/Very Large Array Astrometric Survey (JVAS). The\nlensing probabilities based on such density profiles are too low to match the\nobserved lensing in CLASS/JVAS. High baryon densities in the galaxies that\ndominate the lensing statistics can reconcile this discrepancy, but only if\nthey steepen the mass profile rather than making it more shallow. This places\ncontradictory demands upon the effects of baryons on the central mass profiles\nof galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2008 04:23:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 09:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2010 15:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

In comparison to accretion\nflows without winds, we show that the disc rotates faster and becomes cooler\nbecause of the angular momentum and energy flux which are taking away by the\nwinds.

Such a result, which for the\ncase of Lambda is valid also for any other Hooke-like exotic force proportional\nto r, is in agreement with other negative local tests recently performed in the\nSolar System with the ratios of the non-Newtonian/Einsteinian perihelion\nprecessions for several pairs of planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2008 12:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2008 14:44:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2008 17:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-06"}

Here a sample of 1290 AGN, selected\nin the 2-10 keV band from different flux-limited surveys with very high optical\nidentification completeness is studied. The AGN are grouped into two classes,\nunabsorbed (type-1) and absorbed (type-2), depending on their optical\nspectroscopic classification and X-ray absorption properties, using hardness\nratios. Utilizing the optical to X-ray flux ratios, a rough correction for the\n~8% redshift incompleteness still present in the sample is applied. A strong\ndecrease of the absorbed fraction with X-ray luminosity is found. This can be\nrepresented by an almost linear decrease from ~80% to ~20% in the luminosity\nrange log L_X=42-46 and is consistent with similar derivations in the optical\nand MIR bands. A significant increase of the absorbed fraction with redshift is\nfound, which can be described by a power law with a slope ~(1+z)^{0.62+/-0.11},\nsaturating at a redshift of z~2. A simple power law fit ~(1+z)^{0.48+/-0.08}\nover the whole redshift is also marginally consistent with the data. The\nvariation of the AGN absorption with luminosity and redshift is described with\nhigher statistical accuracy and smaller systematic errors than previous\nresults. The findings have important consequences for the broader context of\nAGN and galaxy co-evolution. Here it is proposed that the cosmic downsizing in\nthe AGN population is due to two different feeding mechanisms: a fast process\nof merger driven accretion at high luminosities and high redshifts versus a\nslow process of gas accretion from gravitational instabilities in galactic\ndisks rebuilding around pre-formed bulges and black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2008 14:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Among the different\nsolutions, vibration energy harvesting has played a major role due to the\nalmost universal presence of mechanical vibrations: from ground shaking to\nhuman movements, from ambient sound to thermal noise. Standard approaches are\nmainly based on resonant linear oscillators that are acted on by ambient\nvibrations. Here we propose a new method based on the exploitation of the\ndynamical features of stochastic nonlinear oscillators. Such a method is shown\nto outperform standard linear oscillators and to overcome some of the most\nsevere limitations of present approaches, like narrow bandwidth, need for\ncontinuous frequency tuning and low efficiency. We demonstrate the superior\nperformances of this method by applying it to piezoelectric energy harvesting\nfrom ambient vibration. Experimental results from a toy-model oscillator are\ndescribed in terms of nonlinear stochastic dynamics. We prove that the method\nproposed here is quite general in principle and could be applied to a wide\nclass of nonlinear oscillators and different energy conversion principles.\nThere are also potentials for realizing micro/nano-scale power generators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2008 15:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here we examine\nthe formation of such hot quasar bubbles using a cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulation which includes a self-consistent treatment of black hole growth and\nassociated feedback, along with radiative gas cooling and star formation. From\nthis simulation, we construct microwave maps of the resulting Sunyaev-Zeldovich\neffect around black holes with a range of masses and redshifts. The size of the\ntemperature distortion scales approximately with black hole mass and accretion\nrate, with a typical amplitude up to a few micro-Kelvin on angular scales\naround 10 arcseconds.
