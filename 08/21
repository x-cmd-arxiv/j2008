Giant protoplanets with masses of 5 M_Jupiter or larger are found\nto be too hot for grain sedimentation to form a silicate core. Smaller\nprotoplanets are cold enough to allow grain settling and core formation. Grain\nsedimentation and core formation occur in the low mass protoplanets because of\ntheir slow contraction rate and low internal temperature. It is predicted that\nmassive giant planets will not have cores, while smaller planets will have\nsmall rocky cores whose masses depend on the planetary mass, the amount of\nsolids within the body, and the disk environment. The protoplanets are found to\nbe too hot to allow the existence of icy grains, and therefore the cores are\npredicted not to contain any ices. It is suggested that the atmospheres of low\nmass giant planets are depleted in refractory elements compared with the\natmospheres of more massive planets. These predictions provide a test of the\ndisk instability model of gas giant planet formation.\n  The core masses of Jupiter and Saturn were found to be ~0.25 M_Earth and ~0.5\nM_Earth, respectively. The core masses of Jupiter and Saturn can be\nsubstantially larger if planetesimal accretion is included. The final core mass\nwill depend on planetesimal size, the time at which planetesimals are formed,\nand the size distribution of the material added to the protoplanet. Jupiter's\ncore mass can vary from 2 to 12 M_Earth. Saturn's core mass is found to be ~8\nM_Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2008 17:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Since AGB stars are (probably) the\nmain providers of cosmic carbon grains, this residual fraction is essential in\nestablishing the validity of current grain models. Here, we use a kinetic\ntreatment to follow the chemical evolution of circumstellar shells towards\nsteady state. It is shown that the residual fraction depends essentially on the\natomic ratio of pristine gaseous carbon and oxygen, and on the cross-section\nfor CH formation by collision of C and H atoms. It lies between 55 and 144 C\natoms per million H atoms, depending on the values adopted for unknown reaction\nrates and cosmic C abundance. This is much larger than predicted by the rule of\nthumb recalled above.\n  The present results depend strongly on the rate of the reaction C+H-->CH: far\nfrom thermodynamic equilibrium (which is the case here), CO cannot be formed if\nthis rate is as low as generally assumed. We have, therefore, estimated this\nrate by chemically modelling the reaction and found it indeed much higher, and\nhigh enough to yield CO abundances compatible with observations.

Twelve of these galaxies have IRS spectra\navailable which we use to measure redshifts and classify these objects as being\ndominated by star formation or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in the\nmid-IR. The IRS spectra and Spitzer photometric redshifts confirm that the DOGs\nlie in a tight redshift distribution around z~2. Based on mid-IR colors, 80% of\nDOGs are likely dominated by star formation; the stacked X-ray emission from\nthis sub-sample of DOGs is also consistent with star formation. Since only a\nsmall number of DOGs are individually detected at far-IR and submm wavelengths,\nwe use a stacking analysis to determine the average flux from these objects and\nplot a composite IR (8-1000 microns) spectral energy distribution (SED). The\naverage luminosity of these star forming DOGs is LIR~1e12 Lsun.

The far-IR SED shape of DOGs is similar to that of\nSMGs (average dust temperature of around 30 K) but DOGs have a higher mid-IR to\nfar-IR flux ratio.

Significant progress has been made on the lattice\nand the beautiful experimental results on the Ke4 and K->3pi decays, as well as\nthose on pionic atoms also confirm the results obtained on the basis of Chiral\nPerturbation Theory. There is an exception: one of the precision experiments on\nKmu3 decay is in flat contradiction with the Callan-Treiman relation. If\nconfirmed, this would indicate physics beyond the Standard Model: right-handed\nquark couplings of the W-boson, for instance. Furthermore, I discuss two\nexamples where the estimates of the effective coupling constants based on\nsaturation by resonances appear to fail.\n  In the second part, the progress made in extending the range of validity of\nthe effective theory with dispersive methods is reviewed. In particular, I draw\nattention to an exact formula, which expresses the mass and width of a\nresonance in terms of observable quantities. The formula removes the\nambiguities inherent in the analytic continuation from the real axis into the\ncomplex plane, which plagued previous determinations of the pole positions\nassociated with broad resonances. In particular, it can now be demonstrated\nthat the lowest resonance of QCD carries the quantum numbers of the vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2008 21:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-22"}

We show that the avalanche\ncannot supply the energy to the heat wave as this increases the resistive force\nby two orders of magnitude.

The reaction kinetics is studied in the limit of deep\nwell, in which the FSE can be solved analytically. This solution enables one to\nobtain the kinetics in a simple analytical form.

Much of the effort in modelling the predicted emission has been\nbased on the analogy with the well-known emission from Jupiter. Unlike Jupiter,\nhowever, many of the targets of these radio searches are so close to their\nparent stars that they may well lie inside the stellar magnetosphere. For these\nclose-in planets we determine which physical processes dominate the radio\nemission and compare our results to those for large-orbit planets that are\nimmersed in the stellar wind. We have modelled the reconnection of the stellar\nand planetary magnetic fields. We calculate the extent of the planetary\nmagnetosphere if it is in pressure balance with its surroundings and determine\nthe conditions under which reconnection of the stellar and planetary magnetic\nfields could provide the accelerated electrons necessary for the predicted\nradio emission. We show that received radio fluxes of tens of mJy are possible\nfor exoplanets in the solar neighbourhood that are close to their parent stars\nif their stars have surface field strengths above 1-10G. We show that for these\nclose-in planets, the power of the radio emission depends principally on the\nratio (Nc/B^{1/3})^2 where Nc is the density at the base of the stellar corona,\nand B is the stellar surface magnetic field strength. Radio emission is most\nlikely to be detected from planets around stars with high-density coronae,\nwhich are therefore likely to be bright X-ray sources. The dependence of\nstellar coronal density on stellar rotation rate and effective temperature is\ncrucial in predicting radio fluxes from exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2008 09:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It studies a financial market with asset\nprices that follow jump-diffusions with negative jumps. The central building\nblock of the market model is its growth optimal portfolio (GOP), which\nmaximizes the growth rate of strictly positive portfolios. Primary security\naccount prices, when expressed in units of the GOP, turn out to be nonnegative\nlocal martingales. In the proposed framework an equivalent risk neutral\nprobability measure need not exist. Derivative prices are obtained as\nconditional expectations of corresponding future payoffs, with the GOP as\nnumeraire and the real world probability as pricing measure. The time when the\nglobal maximum of a portfolio with no positive jumps, when expressed in units\nof the GOP, is reached, is shown to be a generic representation of an honest\ntime. We provide a general formula for the law of such honest times and compute\nthe conditional distributions of the global maximum of a portfolio in this\nframework. Moreover, we provide a stochastic integral representation for\nuniformly integrable martingales whose terminal values are functions of the\nglobal maximum of a portfolio. These formulae are model independent and\nuniversal. We also specialize our results to some examples where we hedge a\npayoff that arrives at an honest time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2008 09:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-10"}

The rigid trimer has been placed on a plate of a\nelectromagnetic shaker and has been vertically vibrated according to a\nsinusoidal signal. The horizontal translational and rotational motions of the\ntrimer have been recorded for a range of frequencies between 25 and 100 Hz\nwhile the amplitude of the forcing vibration was tuned for obtaining maximal\nacceleration of the plate up to 10 times the gravity. Several modes have been\ndetected like e.g. rotational and pure translational motions. These modes are\nfound at determined accelerations of the plate and do not depend on the\nfrequency. By recording the time delays between two successive contacts when\nthe frequency and the amplitude are fixed, a mapping of the bouncing regime has\nbeen constructed and compared to that of the dimer and the bouncing ball.\nPeriod-2 and period-3 orbits have been experimentally observed. In these modes,\naccording to observations, the contact between the trimer and the plate is\npersistent between two successive jumps. This persistence erases the memory of\nthe jump preceding the contact. A model is proposed and allows to explain the\nvalues of the particular accelerations for which period-2 and period-3 modes\nare observed.

This is a Fourier duality, and the\n$x$-variable for the $L^2(\\mu)$-functions is one side in the duality, while the\npoints in $\\Lambda$ is the other. Stated this way, the framework is too wide,\nand we shall restrict attention to measures $\\mu$ which come with an intrinsic\nscaling symmetry built in and specified by a finite and prescribed system of\ncontractive affine mappings in $\\br^d$; an affine iterated function system\n(IFS). This setting allows us to generate candidates for spectral pairs in such\na way that the sets on both sides of the Fourier duality are generated by\nsuitably chosen affine IFSs. For a given affine setup, we spell out the\nappropriate duality conditions that the two dual IFS-systems must have. Our\ncondition is stated in terms of certain complex Hadamard matrices. Our main\nresults give two ways of building higher dimensional spectral pairs from\ncombinatorial algebra and spectral theory applied to lower dimensional systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2008 15:34:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2008 00:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-14"}

The frame potential is a function of N^2 unit vectors. It has a unique\nglobal minimum if the vectors form a SIC, and this property has been made use\nof in numerical searches for SICs. When the vectors form an orbit of the\nHeisenberg group the frame potential becomes a function of a single fiducial\nvector. We analytically compute the average of this function over Hilbert\nspace. We also compute averages when the fiducial vector is placed in certain\nspecial subspaces defined by the Clifford group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2008 15:48:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 12:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-26"}
