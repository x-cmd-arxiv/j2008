This\nconfirms the idea that large MBAs, over hundreds millions of years,have\ndeveloped a fine and thick thermally insulating regolith layer, responsible for\nthe low values of their thermal inertia, whereas km-sized asteroids, having\ncollisional lifetimes of only some millions years, have less regolith, and\nconsequently a larger surface thermal inertia. Because it is believed that\nregolith on asteroids forms as a result of impact processes, a better knowledge\nof asteroid thermal inertia values and its correlation with size, taxonomic\ntype, and density can be used as an important constraintfor modeling of impact\nprocesses on asteroids. However, our knowledge of asteroids' thermal inertia\nvalues is still based on few data points with NEAs covering the size range\n0.1-20 km and MBAs that >100 km. Here, we use IRAS infrared measurements to\nestimate the thermal inertias of MBAs with diameters 100 km and known shapes\nand spin vector: filling an important size gap between the largest MBAs and the\nkm-sized NEAs. An update to the inverse correlation between thermal inertia and\ndiameter is presented. For some asteroids thermophysical modelling allowed us\nto discriminate between the two still possible spin vector solutions derived\nfrom optical lightcurve inversion.

A channel in this class has the property that, for the\ntransmitter-receiver pair that suffers from interference, the conditional\noutput entropy at the receiver is invariant with respect to the transmitted\ncodewords. We compare the new capacity region upper bound with the\nHan/Kobayashi achievable rate region for interference channels. This comparison\nshows that our bound is tight in some cases, thereby yielding specific points\non the capacity region as well as sum capacity for certain Z-interference\nchannels. In particular, this result can be used as an alternate method to\nobtain sum capacity of Gaussian Z-interference channels. We then apply an\nadditional restriction on our channel class: the transmitter-receiver pair that\nsuffers from interference achieves its maximum output entropy with a single\ninput distribution irrespective of the interference distribution.

Both gaps are closed above Tc at the bulk Tc, but only the small gap\ncan be fitted with a superconducting gap function. This gap displays a BCS -\nlike order parameter. Above Tc, at the same location where the small gap was\nobserved, a pseudogap (PG) opens abruptly at a temperature just above Tc and\ncloses at 120 K. In contrast to the cuprates, the SG and PG have competing\norder parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2008 18:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-07"}

Rotation curves for the main and companion galaxies\nwere obtained, showing a deprojected velocity amplitude of 175 km/s and 185\nkm/s, respectively. The interaction between the main and companion galaxies was\nmodeled using numerical N-body/hydrodynamical simulations, with the result\nindicating that the current stage of the merger would be about 250 Myr after\nperigalacticum. The spatial variation in the distribution of the stellar\npopulation components in both galaxies was analysed by fitting combinations of\nstellar population models of different age groups. The central region of main\ngalaxy is dominated by an old (5-10 Gyr) population, while significant\ncontributions from a young (200 Myr) and intermediate (1 Gyr) components are\nfound in the disk, being enhanced in the direction of the tidal features. The\nstellar population of the companion galaxy is overall much younger, being\ndominated by components with 1 Gyr or less, quite widely spread over the whole\ndisk. Spatial profiles of the oxygen abundance were obtained from the a grid of\nphotoionization models using the R23 line ratio. The disk of the main galaxy\nshows a clear radial gradient, while the companion galaxy presents an oxygen\nabundance relatively homogeneous across the disk. The absence of an abundance\ngradient in the secondary galaxy is interpreted in terms of mixing by gas flows\nfrom the outer parts to the center of the galaxy due to the gravitational\ninteraction with the more massive primary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2008 18:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This explanation is in contradiction with the thermodynamics\nsecond law. The warming up by greenhouse effect is quite improbable. It is\ncloud reflection that gives to the earth s ground its 15 degres C mean\ntemperature. Since the reflection of the radiation by gases is negligible, the\nrole of the atmosphere greenhouse gases in the earth warming up by earth\nradiation reflection loses its importance. We think that natural climatic\noscillations contribute more to earth climatic disturbances. The oscillation\nthat we hypothesize to exist has a long period (800 to 1000 years). The glacier\nmelting and regeneration cycles lead to variations in the cold region ocean\nwater density and thermal conductibility according to their salinity. These\nvariations lead one to think about a macro climate oscillating between maximum\nhot and minimum cold temperatures. This oscillation is materialized by the\npassages of the planet through hot, mild, and cold eras, leading to the great\nseason climatic oscillation phenomenon (GSCO). Thus, our planet lives four\ngreat seasons a great spring, a great summer, a great winter and a great\nautumn/fall, making a great year embracing our four small classical yearly\nseasons. The probabilistic character of the parameters that are at the origin\nof this climatic oscillation makes the long-term prediction less precise but\nthe deterministic tendencies and the resonance phenomena give precious\ninformation on our planet climatic future. The present warming up is well\ninterpreted in the frame of the great season climatic oscillation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2008 18:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-07"}

In the next few years, the SKA pathfinders will\nprovide statistical measurements of this signal. Numerical simulations\npredicting these observations are necessary to optimize the design of the\ninstruments. The main difficulty is the computation of the spin temperature of\nneutral hydrogen which depends on the gas kinetic temperature and on the level\nof the local Lyman-alpha flux. A T_s >> T_cmb assumption is usual. However,\nthis assumption does not apply early in the reionization history, or even later\nin the history as long as the sources of X-rays are too weak to heat the\nintergalactic medium significantly. This work presents the first EoR numerical\nsimulations including, beside dynamics and ionizing continuum radiative\ntransfer, a self-consistent treatment of the Ly-alpha radiative transfer. This\nallows us to compute the spin temperature more accurately. We use two different\nbox sizes, 20 Mpc/h and 100 Mpc/h, and a star source model. Using the redshift\ndependence of average quantities, maps, and power spectra, we quantify the\neffect of using different assumptions to compute the spin temperature and the\ninfluence of the box size. The first effect comes from allowing for a signal in\nabsorption. The magnitude of this effect depends on the amount of heating by\nhydrodynamic shocks and X-rays in the intergalactic medium(IGM). The second\neffects comes from using the real, local, Lyman-alpha flux. This effect is\nimportant for an average ionization fraction of less than 10%: it changes the\noverall amplitude of the 21 cm signal, and adds its own fluctuations to the\npower spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2008 21:20:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2008 18:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A nonequilibrium\nKeldysh action for the superconducting fluctuations on the normal side is\nderived. Current flow, besides its minimal coupling to the order parameter is\nfound to give rise to two new effects.

The\nlatter is a combination of CF in one direction and DF in the other. We derive\nachievable rate regions for the CF and Mixed relaying schemes for the two and\nthree phase protocols. In the last part of this work we provide a comprehensive\ntreatment of 8 possible half-duplex bi-directional relaying protocols in\nGaussian noise, obtaining their respective achievable rate regions, outer\nbounds, and their relative performance under different SNR and relay\ngeometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2008 04:15:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2009 21:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-16"}

These solutions appear to\nviolate causality and so are considered problematic. Since CTCs reflect the\nglobal properties of a spacetime, one can attempt to change its topology,\nwithout changing its geometry, in such a way that the former CTCs are no longer\nclosed in the new spacetime. This procedure is informally known as unwrapping.\nHowever, changes in global identifications tend to lead to local effects, and\nunwrapping is no exception, as it introduces a special kind of singularity,\ncalled quasi-regular. This \"unwrapping\" singularity is similar to the string\nsingularities. We give two examples of unwrapping of essentially 2+1\ndimensional spacetimes with CTCs, the Gott spacetime and the Godel universe. We\nshow that the unwrapped Gott spacetime, while singular, is at least devoid of\nCTCs. In contrast, the unwrapped Godel spacetime still contains CTCs through\nevery point. A \"multiple unwrapping\" procedure is devised to remove the\nremaining circular CTCs. We conclude that, based on the two spacetimes we\ninvestigated, CTCs appearing in the solutions of the Einstein equation are not\nsimply a mathematical artifact of coordinate identifications, but are indeed a\nnecessary consequence of General Relativity, provided only that we demand these\nsolutions do not possess naked quasi-regular singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2008 05:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Asymptotic properties for\nthese types of procedures in settings like linear regression and ARMA time\nseries have been studied, but these do not naturally extend to nonstandard\nsituations such as mixed effects models, where simple definition of the sample\nsize is not meaningful. This paper introduces a new class of strategies, known\nas fence methods, for mixed model selection, which includes linear and\ngeneralized linear mixed models. The idea involves a procedure to isolate a\nsubgroup of what are known as correct models (of which the optimal model is a\nmember). This is accomplished by constructing a statistical fence, or barrier,\nto carefully eliminate incorrect models. Once the fence is constructed, the\noptimal model is selected from among those within the fence according to a\ncriterion which can be made flexible. In addition, we propose two variations of\nthe fence. The first is a stepwise procedure to handle situations of many\npredictors; the second is an adaptive approach for choosing a tuning constant.\nWe give sufficient conditions for consistency of fence and its variations, a\ndesirable property for a good model selection procedure. The methods are\nillustrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2008 09:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-08"}

The nonconcave penalized likelihood\nestimators enjoy the oracle properties, but maximizing the penalized likelihood\nfunction is computationally challenging, because the objective function is\nnondifferentiable and nonconcave. In this article, we propose a new unified\nalgorithm based on the local linear approximation (LLA) for maximizing the\npenalized likelihood for a broad class of concave penalty functions.\nConvergence and other theoretical properties of the LLA algorithm are\nestablished. A distinguished feature of the LLA algorithm is that at each LLA\nstep, the LLA estimator can naturally adopt a sparse representation. Thus, we\nsuggest using the one-step LLA estimator from the LLA algorithm as the final\nestimates. Statistically, we show that if the regularization parameter is\nappropriately chosen, the one-step LLA estimates enjoy the oracle properties\nwith good initial estimators. Computationally, the one-step LLA estimation\nmethods dramatically reduce the computational cost in maximizing the nonconcave\npenalized likelihood.

The event rates and detailed signals expected in these\nexperiments depend on the dark matter phase space distribution on\nsub-milliparsec scales. These scales are many orders of magnitude smaller than\nthose that can be resolved by conventional N-body simulations, so one cannot\nhope to use such tools to investigate the effect of mergers in the history of\nthe Milky Way on the detailed phase-space structure probed by the current\nexperiments. In this paper we present an alternative approach to investigating\nthe results of such mergers, by studying a simplified model for a merger of a\nsub-halo with a larger parent halo. With an appropriate choice of parent halo\npotential, the evolution of material from the sub-halo can be expressed\nanalytically in action-angle variables, so it is possible to obtain its entire\norbit history very rapidly without numerical integration. Furthermore by\nevolving backwards in time, we can obtain arbitrarily-high spatial resolution\nfor the current velocity distribution at a fixed point. Although this model\ncannot provide a detailed quantitative comparison with the Milky Way, its\nproperties are sufficiently generic that it offers qualitative insight into the\nexpected structure arising from a merger at a resolution that cannot be\napproached with full numerical simulations. Preliminary results indicate that\nthe velocity-space distribution of dark matter particles remains characterized\nby discrete and well-defined peaks over an extended period of time, both for\nsingle and multi-merging systems, in contrast to the simple smooth velocity\ndistributions sometimes assumed in predicting laboratory experiment detection\nrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2008 15:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}
