Recent work by Matt and Pudritz has\nsuggested that if classical T Tauri stars exhibit stellar winds with mass loss\nrates about 0.1 times their accretion rates, the wind can carry away enough\nangular momentum to keep the stars from being spun up unrealistically by\naccretion. This paper presents a preliminary set of theoretical models of\naccretion-driven winds from the polar regions of T Tauri stars. These models\nare based on recently published self-consistent simulations of the Sun's\ncoronal heating and wind acceleration. In addition to the convection-driven MHD\nturbulence (which dominates in the solar case), we add another source of wave\nenergy at the photosphere that is driven by the impact of plasma in neighboring\nflux tubes undergoing magnetospheric accretion. This added energy, determined\nquantitatively from the far-field theory of MHD wave generation, is sufficient\nto produce T Tauri-like mass loss rates of at least 0.01 times the accretion\nrate. While still about an order of magnitude below the level required for\nefficient angular momentum removal, these are the first self-consistent models\nof T Tauri winds that agree reasonably well with a range of observational mass\nloss constraints. The youngest modeled stellar winds are supported by Alfven\nwave pressure, they have low temperatures (\"extended chromospheres\"), and they\nare likely to be unstable to the formation of counterpropagating shocks and\nclumps far from the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 13:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Comparing our\nradiative plus dust cooling runs to a purely radiative cooling simulation we\nfind that dust has an impact on cluster scaling relations. It mainly affects\nthe normalisation of the scalings (and their evolution), whereas it introduces\nno significant differences on their slopes. The strength of the effect depends\ncritically on the dust abundance and grain size parameters as well as on the\ncluster scaling. Indeed, cooling due to dust is effective at the cluster regime\nand has a stronger effect on the \"baryon driven\" statistical properties of\nclusters such as $L_{\\rm X}-M$, $Y- M$, $S-M$ scaling relations. Major\ndifferences, relative to the radiative cooling model, are as high as 25% for\nthe $L_{\\rm X}-M$ normalisation, and about 10% for the $Y-M$ and $S-M$\nnormalisations at redshift zero.

In the\nfrequency-domain variant of this scheme the quantities $F^{\\mu}_l$ are obtained\nby fully decomposing the particle's self field into Fourier-harmonic modes $l m\n\\omega$, calculating the contribution of each such mode to $F^{\\mu}_l$, and\nthen summing over $\\omega$ and $m$ for given $l$. This procedure has the\nadvantage that one only encounters {\\it ordinary} differential equations.\nHowever, for eccentric orbits, the sum over $\\omega$ is found to converge badly\nat the particle's location. This problem (reminiscent of the familiar Gibbs\nphenomenon) results from the discontinuity of the time-domain $F^{\\mu}_l$ field\nat the particle's worldline.

The method utilizes the {\\it homogeneous} modes $l m\n\\omega$ of the self field to construct $F^{\\mu}_l$ (rather than the\ninhomogeneous modes, as in the standard method), which guarantees an\nexponentially-fast convergence to the correct value of $F^{\\mu}_l$, even at the\nparticle's location. We illustrate the application of the method with the\nexample of the monopole scalar-field perturbation from a scalar charge in an\neccentric orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole.

The spectra revealed that the\ndiffuse emission is comprised of thermal and non-thermal components.

In configurations\ncontaining confining walls or constrictions transport is controlled both by the\nfluctuation statistics of the jittering objects and the phase space available\nto their dynamics. Consequently, the study of transport at the macro- and\nnanoscales must address both Brownian motion and entropic effects. With this\nsurvey we report on recent advances in the theoretical and numerical\ninvestigation of stochastic transport occurring either in micro-sized\ngeometries of varying cross section or in narrow channels wherein the diffusing\nparticles are hindered from passing each other (single file diffusion). For\nparticles undergoing biased diffusion in static suspension media enclosed by\nconfining geometries, transport exhibits intriguing features such as (i) a\ndecrease of nonlinear mobility with increasing temperature or, also, (ii) a\nbroad excess peak of the effective diffusion above the free diffusion limit.\nThese paradoxical aspects can be understood in terms of entropic contributions\nresulting from the restricted dynamics in phase space. If, in addition, the\nsuspension medium is subjected to external, time-dependent forcing,\nrectification or segregation of the diffusing Brownian particles becomes\npossible. Likewise, the diffusion in very narrow, spatially modulated channels\ngets modified via contact particle-particle interactions, which induce\nanomalous sub-diffusion. The effective sub-diffusion constant for a driven\nsingle file also develops a resonance-like structure as a function of the\nconfining coupling constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 07:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-22"}

Four\nof the objects exhibit X-ray spectra indicative of a hard excess, consistent\nwith a heavily obscured X-ray component and hence a hidden nucleus. In these\nobjects the softer X-rays may be dominated by a strong soft scattered continuum\nor contamination from the host galaxy, which is responsible for the unabsorbed\nX-ray spectra observed, and accounts for the anomalously low 2-10 keV X-ray\nluminosity. We confirm this assertion in NGC4501 with a Chandra observation,\nwhich shows hard X-ray emission coincident with the nucleus, consistent with\nheavy absorption, and a number of contaminating softer sources which account\nfor the bulk of the softer emission. We point out that such 'Compton thick'\nsources need not necessarily present iron Ka emission of high EW. An example in\nour sample is IRASF01475-0740, which we know must host an obscured AGN as it\nhosts a HBLR seen in scattered light (Tran 2003).

The star formation rate derived from a similar analysis of\nthe UV luminosities is 17 $M_\\odot$ year$^{-1}$, without any correction for UV\ndust attenuation. The simplest conclusion is that the dust attenuation factor\nis 1.8 at UV wavelengths. However, this factor is considerably smaller than the\nstandard attenuation factor $\\sim 5$, normally assumed for LBGs. We discuss\npotential reasons for this discrepancy, including the possibility that the dust\nattenuation factor at $z \\ge 3$ is smaller than at lower redshifts. Conversely,\nthe radio luminosity for a given star formation rate may be systematically\nlower at very high redshift. Two possible causes for a suppressed radio\nluminosity are: (i) increased inverse Compton cooling of the relativistic\nelectron population due to scattering off the increasing CMB at high redshift,\nor (ii) cosmic ray diffusion from systematically smaller galaxies. The radio\ndetections of individual sources are consistent with a radio-loud AGN fraction\nof 0.3%. One source is identified as a very dusty, extreme starburst galaxy (a\n'submm galaxy').\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 14:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We find a correlation between the\nlocation of the low (high) frequency vibrational modes and regions of high\n(low) propensity for motion. This is similar to what was observed in continuous\nforce systems, but our interpretation is different: in our case relaxation is\ndue to localised excitations which propagate through the system; these\nlocalised excitations act as background disorder for the elastic network,\ngiving rise to anomalous vibrational modes. Our results show that a correlation\nbetween spatially extended low frequency modes and high propensity regions does\nnot imply that relaxational dynamics originates in extended soft modes. We\nconsider other measures of elastic heterogeneity, such as non-affine\ndisplacement fields and mode localisation lengths, and discuss implications of\nour results to interpretations of dynamic heterogeneity more generally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 15:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

The two-pion source functions of the\ngranular sources exhibit a two-tiered structure. Using a parametrized formula\nof granular two-pion source function, we examine the two-tiered structure of\nthe source functions for the imaging data of Au+Au collisions at Alternating\nGradient Synchrotron (AGS) and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We find\nthat the imaging technique introduced by Brown and Danielewicz is suitable for\nprobing the granular structure of the sources. Our data-fitting results\nindicate that there is not visible granularity for the sources at AGS energies.\nHowever, the data for the RHIC collisions with the selections of $40 < {\\rm\ncentrality} < 90%$ and $0.20<k_{\\rm T}<0.36$ GeV/c are better described by the\nmodel with granular emission than that of one Gaussian. The model with granular\nsource has more parameters than the simple Gaussian, hence can describe more\ncomplicated shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 15:53:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 15:48:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 2008 15:32:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2008 15:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
