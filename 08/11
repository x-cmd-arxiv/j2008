We present abundance analysis based on high resolution spectra of 105\nisolated red giant branch (RGB) stars in the Galactic Globular Cluster NGC 6121\n(M4). Our aim is to study its star population in the context of the\nmulti-population phenomenon recently discovered to affect some Globular\nClusters. METHODS. The data have been collected with FLAMES+UVES, at the\nESO/VLT@UT2 telescope. Analysis was performed under LTE approximation for the\nfollowing elements: O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Ba, and NLTE\ncorrections were applied to Na and Mg. Spectroscopic data were coupled with\nhigh-precision wide-field UBVI$_{\\rm C}$ photometry from WFI@2.2m telescope and\ninfrared JHK photometry from 2MASS. RESULTS: We derived an average $\\rm\n{[Fe/H]}=-1.07\\pm0.01$ (internal error), and an $\\alpha$ enhancement of $\\rm\n{[\\alpha/Fe]}=+0.39\\pm0.05$ dex (internal error).

By coupling our results with previous studies on the CN band\nstrength, we find that the CN strong stars have higher Na and Al content and\nare more O depleted than the CN weak ones.

In the\n$\\rm {U}$ vs. $\\rm {U-B}$ color magnitude diagram the RGB spread is present rom\nthe base of the RGB to the RGB-tip.

An irregularity\n('bump') in the spectrum is observed at primary energies of ~74 PeV. This bump\nexceeds a smooth power-law fit to the data by about 4 standard deviations. Not\nrejecting stochastic nature of the bump completely, we examined the systematic\nuncertainties of our methods and conclude that they cannot be responsible for\nthe observed feature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Aug 2008 19:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-02"}

In this paper we suggest that N=8 SUGRA has the\nsimplest interacting S-matrix in 4D. Using Grassmann coherent states for\nexternal particles shows that amplitudes with maximal SUSY are smooth objects,\nwith the action of SUSY manifest. We show that all tree amplitudes in N=4 SYM\nand N=8 SUGRA vanish at (supersymmetric) infinite complex momentum, and can\nthus be determined by recursion relations. We also identify the action of the\nnon-linearly realized E_{7(7)} symmetry of N=8 SUGRA on scattering amplitudes.\nWe give a simple discussion of the structure of 1-loop amplitudes in any QFT,\nin close parallel to recent work of Forde, showing that the coefficients of\nscalar \"triangle\" and \"bubble\" integrals are determined by the \"pole at\ninfinite momentum\" of tree amplitude products appearing in cuts. The on-shell\nsuperspace for maximal SUSY makes it easy to compute the multiplet sums that\narise in these cuts, leading to a simple proof of the absence of triangles and\nbubbles at 1-loop. We also argue that rational terms are absent. This\nestablishes the recent conjecture that 1-loop amplitudes in N=8 SUGRA have only\nscalar box integrals, just as N=4 SYM. It is natural to conjecture that with\nmaximal SUSY, amplitudes are completely determined by their leading\nsingularities even beyond tree- and 1-loop level; this would directly imply the\nperturbative finiteness of N=8 SUGRA. The remarkable properties of scattering\namplitudes call for an explanation in terms of a \"weak-weak\" dual formulation\nof QFT, a holographic dual of flat space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2008 05:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2008 20:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2010 21:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

This is reflected in\nthe 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen, which is coupled to the gas temperature\nthrough collisions at high redshifts, and through the Wouthuysen-Field effect\nat low redshifts. We present a semi-analytic model for star formation and the\nbuild-up of a Lyman alpha background in the presence of magnetic fields, and\ncalculate the evolution of the mean 21 cm brightness temperature and its\nfrequency gradient as a function of redshift. We further discuss the evolution\nof linear fluctuations in temperature and ionization in the presence of\nmagnetic fields and calculate the effect on the 21 cm power spectrum. At high\nredshifts, the signal is increased compared to the non-magnetic case due to the\nadditional heat input into the IGM from ambipolar diffusion and the decay of\nMHD turbulence. At lower redshifts, the formation of luminous objects and the\nbuild-up of a Lyman alpha background can be delayed by a redshift interval of\n10 due to the strong increase of the filtering mass scale in the presence of\nmagnetic fields.

When this problem is\nstudied by Monte Carlo simulation of self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic\nlattice applying a cylindrical confinement and using the standard\npruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM), one obtains spurious results,\nhowever: with increasing chain length the transition gets weaker and weaker,\ndue to insufficient sampling of the \"escaped\" states, as a detailed analysis\nshows. In order to solve this problem, a new variant of a biased sequential\nsampling algorithm with re-sampling is proposed, force-biased PERM: the\ndifficulty of sampling both phases in the region of the first order transition\nwith the correct weights is treated by applying a force at the free end pulling\nit out of the tube. Different strengths of this force need to be used and\nreweighting techniques are applied.

In\nparticular, we examine the charmonium `melting' and the `comover dissociation'\nscenarios - implemented in a microscopic transport approach - in comparison to\nthe available data from the SPS and RHIC. The analysis shows that the dynamics\nof c, c-bar quarks at RHIC are dominated by partonic or `pre-hadronic'\ninteractions in the strongly coupled plasma stage. Both the `charmonium\nmelting' and the hadronic `comover absorption and recreation model' are found,\nhowever, to be compatible with the experimental observation at SPS energies;\nthe experimental ratio of Psi'/J/Psi versus centrality clearly favors the\n`hadronic comover' scenario. We find that the collective flow of charm in the\npurely hadronic Hadron-String Dynamics (HSD) transport appears compatible with\nthe data at SPS energies, but substantially underestimates the data at top RHIC\nenergies. Thus, the large elliptic flow v2 of D-mesons and the low R_AA(p_T) of\nJ/Psi seen experimentally have to be attributed to early interactions of\nnon-hadronic degrees of freedom. Simultaneously, we observe that non-hadronic\ninteractions are mandatory in order to describe the narrowing of the J/Psi\nrapidity distribution from pp to central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC\nenergy. We demonstrate additionally that the strong quenching of low-pT J/Psi's\nin central Au+Au collisions indicates that a large fraction of final J/Psi\nmesons is created by a coalescence mechanism close to the phase boundary.\nThroughout this review we, furthermore, provide predictions for charm\nobservables from Au+Au collisions at FAIR energies of 25-35 AGeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2008 13:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Using a particle-injection method, we investigate the\neffect of structure close to the wind sources and the short-timescale influence\nof winds on protoclusters. Structures such as disks and gaseous filaments have\na strong collimating effect. By a different technique of injecting momentum\nfrom point sources, we compare the large-scale, long-term effects of isotropic\nand intrinsically-collimated winds and find them to be similar. Both types of\nwind dramatically slow the global star formation process, but the timescale on\nwhich they expel significant mass from the cluster is rather long (approaching\n10 freefall times). Clusters may then experience rapid star formation early in\ntheir lifetimes, before switching to a mode where gas is gradually expelled,\nwhile star formation proceeds much more slowly. This complicates conclusions\nregarding slow star formation derived from measuring the star-formation\nefficiency per freefall time. Estimates of the efficacy of winds in dispersing\nclusters derived simply from the total wind momentum flux may not be very\nreliable. This is due to material being expelled from deep within stellar\npotential wells, often to velocities well in excess of the cluster escape\nvelocity, and also to the loss of momentum flux through holes in the gas\ndistribution. Winds have little effect on the accretion--driven stellar IMF\nexcept at the very high-mass end, where they serve to prevent some of the most\nmassive objects accreting. We also find that the morphology of the gas, the\nrapid motions of the wind sources and the action of accretion flows prevent the\nformation of bubble-like structures.

The sensor is composed of two\nhalf-wavelength microstrip line resonators, designed to match the 50 Ohms\nimpedance of the lines on a high dielectric constant GaAs substrate. The line\nresonators cross each other perpendicularly through their centers, forming a\ncross. Microstrip feed lines are coupled through small gaps to three arms of\nthe cross to connect the resonator to the excitation ports. The control of the\nrelative magnitude and phase between the two microwave stimuli at the input\nports of each line allows for tuning the degree and type of polarization of the\nmicrowave excitation at the center of the cross resonator. The third (output)\nport is used to measure the transmitted signal, which is crucial to work at low\ntemperatures, where reflections along lengthy coaxial lines mask the signal\nreflected by the resonator. EPR spectra recorded at low temperature in an S=\n5/2 molecular magnet system show that 82%-fidelity circular polarization of the\nmicrowaves is achieved over the central area of the resonator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2008 15:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Around ten percent of these events involve\nbinary lenses. Such events potentially contain much information on the physical\nproperties of the observed binary systems, which can then be used for e.g.\nstatistical studies on binary objects in the Galactic disk or bulge. However,\nsuch events are usually not straightforward to study, because the model\nequations are strongly non-linear and there are many local minima that can fool\nthe search for the best solution if the parameter space is not inspected with\ngreat care. In this work an alternative parameterisation for the binary lens\nfitting problem is proposed, in which the parameters involved are defined to\nrepresent as closely as possible the caustic-crossing features observed in most\nbinary lens light curves. Furthermore, we work out an extension of the method\nin order to make use of the straight line fold caustic approximation, when the\nlatter applies for both the caustic entry and exit. We introduce an alternative\nparameterisation in order to confine the exploration of the parameter space to\nregions where the models only involve caustic crossing at the dates seen in the\nlight curve. We find that the proposed parameterisation provides more\nrobustness to the light curve fitting process, in particular in avoiding a code\nto get stuck in false minima.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2008 15:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 12:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
