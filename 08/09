This galaxy bias acts as a hindrance to the\nextraction of cosmological information from the galaxy power spectrum or\ncorrelation function. Theoretical arguments show that a change in the amplitude\nof the clustering between galaxies and mass on large-scales is unavoidable, but\ncosmological information can be easily extracted from the shape of the power\nspectrum or correlation function if this bias is independent of scale.\nScale-dependent bias is generally small on large scales, k<0.1 h.Mpc^{-1}, but\non smaller scales can affect the recovery of \\Omega_m.h from the measured shape\nof the clustering signal, and have a small effect on the Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations. In this paper we investigate the transition from\nscale-independent to scale-dependent galaxy bias as a function of galaxy\npopulation. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR5 sample to fit various\nmodels, which attempt to parametrise the turn-off from scale-independent\nbehaviour. For blue galaxies, we find that the strength of the turn-off is\nstrongly dependent on galaxy luminosity, with stronger scale-dependent bias on\nlarger scales for more luminous galaxies. For red galaxies, the\nscale-dependence is a weaker function of luminosity. Such trends need to be\nmodelled in order to optimally extract the information available in future\nsurveys, and can help with the design of such surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2008 16:08:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2008 14:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}

We find that matter in the eccentric tail returns at a\nsuper-Eddington rate and is eventually (0.1 sec) unable to cool via neutrino\nemission and accrete all the way to the black hole. Therefore, contrary to\nprevious claims, our analysis suggests that fallback matter is not an efficient\nsource of late time accretion power and is unlikely to cause the late flaring\nactivity observed in SGRB afterglows. The fallback matter rather forms a\nradiation-driven wind or a bound atmosphere. In both cases, the emitting plasma\nis very opaque and photons are released with a degraded energy in the X-ray\nband.

Here, I summarize some consequences that\ncan be derived from the galaxy Scaling Laws (SLs) and present a coherent\nscenario for the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies and their\ncentral SMBHs, focusing in particular on the establishment and maintenance of\ntheir SLs. In particular, after a first observationally based part, the\ndiscussion focuses on the physical interpretation of the Fundamental Plane.\nThen, two important processes in principle able to destroy the galaxy and SMBH\nSLs, namely galaxy merging and cooling flows, are analyzed. Arguments\nsupporting the necessity to clearly distinguish between the origin and\nmaintenance of the different SLs, and the unavoidable occurrence of SMBH\nfeedback on the galaxy ISM in the late stages of galaxy evolution (when\nelliptical galaxies are sometimes considered as ``dead, red objects''), are\nthen presented. At the end of the paper I will discuss some implications of the\nrecent discovery of super-dense ellipticals in the distant Universe. In\nparticular, I will argue that, if confirmed, these new observations would lead\nto the conclusion that at early epochs a relation between the stellar mass of\nthe galaxy and the mass of the central SMBH should hold, consistent with the\npresent day Magorrian relation, while the proportionality coefficient between\nMbh and the scale of velocity dispersion of the hosting spheroids should be\nsignificantly smaller than that at the present epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2008 12:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The first kind presents an\nanisotropic absorption - as in a polaroid film - and the second one is based on\ntotal reflection at the interface with a birefringent medium. Using the Stokes\nvector representation, we determine explicitly the trajectories of the wave\nlight polarization during the polarization process. We find that such\ntrajectories are not always geodesics of the Poincar\\'e sphere as it is usually\nthought. Using the analogy between light polarization and special relativity,\nwe find that the action of successive polarizers on the light wave polarization\nis equivalent to the action of a single resulting polarizer followed by a\nrotation achieved for example by a device with optical activity. We find a\ncomposition law for polarizers similar to the composition law for noncollinear\nvelocities in special relativity. We define an angle equivalent to the\nrelativistic Wigner angle which can be used to quantify the quality of two\ncomposed polarizers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2008 13:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-09"}

The thermal free energy is computed at the one-loop\nstring level, and it is shown to be free of the usual Hagedorn-like\ninstabilities for a certain choice of the chemical potentials. In the closed\nstring gravitational sector, as well as in the open string matter sector of the\nproposed orientifold construction, the free energy turns out to have\n\"Temperature duality\" symmetry, ${\\cal F}(T/T_H)={T^2\\over T_H^2} {\\cal\nF}(T_H/T)$, which requires interchanging the space-time spinor representations\n$S\\leftrightarrow C$. For small temperatures, $T\\to 0$, the anti-spinor $C$\ndecouples from the spectrum while for large temperatures, $T\\to \\infty$, the\nspinor $S$ decouples. In both limits the free energy vanishes, as we recover a\nconventional type II superstring theory. At the self dual point $T=T_H$, the\nthermal spectra of $S$ and $C$ are identical.
