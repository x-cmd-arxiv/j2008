We explore the probability density function of $\\tau$,\n$P_q(\\tau)$, assuming a stretched exponential function, $P_q(\\tau) \\sim\ne^{-\\tau^\\gamma}$. We find that the exponent $\\gamma$ depends on the threshold\nin the range between $q=1$ and 6 standard deviations of the volatility. This\nfinding supports the multiscaling nature of the return interval distribution.\nTo better understand the multiscaling origin, we study how $\\gamma$ depends on\nfour essential factors, capitalization, risk, number of trades and return. We\nshow that $\\gamma$ depends on the capitalization, risk and return but almost\ndoes not depend on the number of trades.

A total of 74 individual emission\nfeatures are detected, of which 69 are identified to arise from 21 molecular\nspecies and isotopologues, with 5 faint lines remaining unidentified.

The Kadanoff-Baym-Wagner equations for the nonequilibrium Green\nfunctions are derived, and numerically solved. The contributions of initial\ncorrelations are studied by monitoring the system evolution. It is found that\nthe initial correlations are essential for establishing full electron\ncorrelations of the system and independent on the starting time of preparing\nthe system in equilibrium. By examining the contributions of the initial\ncorrelations to the electric current and the double occupation, we find that\nthe contributions are small in relation to the total value of those physical\nquantities when the interaction is weak, and significantly increase when the\ninteraction is strong. The neglect of initial correlations may cause artifacts\nin the nonequilibrium properties of the system, especially in the strong\ninteraction case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2008 12:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
