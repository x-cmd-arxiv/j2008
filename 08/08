However these studies have been severely hampered by the small sizes\nof fields having deep near-infrared imaging. Here we use the large UKIDSS Ultra\nDeep Survey to study the clustering of DRGs. The size and depth of this survey\nallows for an unprecedented measurement of the angular clustering of DRGs at\n2<z_phot<3 and K<21. The correlation function shows the expected power law\nbehavior, but with an apparent upturn at theta<~10\". We deproject the angular\nclustering to infer the spatial correlation length, finding 10.6+-1.6 h^-1 Mpc.\nWe use the halo occupation distribution framework to demonstrate that the\nobserved strong clustering of DRGs is not consistent with standard models of\ngalaxy clustering, confirming previous suggestions that were based on smaller\nsamples. Inaccurate photometric redshifts could artificially enhance the\nobserved clustering, however significant systematic redshift errors would be\nrequired to bring the measurements into agreement with the models. Another\npossibility is that the underlying assumption that galaxies interact with their\nlarge-scale environment only through halo mass is not valid, and that other\nfactors drive the evolution of the oldest, most massive galaxies at z~2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2008 17:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We have\nestablished that the LMXB hosting frequency is correlated to various GC\nproperties such as mass and metallicity. While the X-ray luminosities of a few\nof the brightest LMXBs in GCs are consistent with the accreting object being a\nblack hole (BH), the only definitive way to distinguish between a black hole\nand multiple superposed sources in a GC is to detect variability. We have\ndiscovered just such a variable 4x10^39 erg/s black hole X-ray binary in a low\nmetallicity globular cluster in the halo of NGC 4472. The change in the X-ray\nspectrum between the bright and faint epochs suggests that the luminosity\nvariation is due to eclipsing by a warped accretion disk. The optical spectrum\nof this source also reveals strong, broad, [O III] lambda 5007 and [O III]\nlambda 4959 emission. An analysis of the X-ray spectrum suggests that the [O\nIII] lines are produced by the photoionization of a wind driven by a stellar\nmass black hole accreting mass at or above its Eddington luminosity. As it is\ndynamically implausible to form an accreting stellar mass BH system in a GC\nwith an intermediate mass BH it appears that this massive globular cluster does\nnot harbor an intermediate mass BH. The inferred mass of this BH falls well\nbelow the extrapolation of the well known M_BH-sigma and M_BH-M_Stellar\nrelations to this GC. Therefore our analysis suggests that not all old, metal\npoor stellar systems form black holes consistent with these relations, which\nhave been established for much more massive stellar systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2008 16:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We\nfocus on the optimization of two design parameters associated with the LA: 1)\ninitial position upon LA update; 2) distance threshold for triggering of LA\nupdate. Based on the popular continuous-time random walk (CTRW) mobility model,\nwe propose a novel analytical framework that uses a diffusion equation to\nminimize the location management cost. In this framework, a number of\nmeasurable physical parameters, such as length of road section, angle between\nroad sections, and road section crossing time, can be integrated into the\nsystem design. This framework allows us to easily evaluate the total cost under\ngeneral call arrival distributions and LA of different shapes. For the\nparticular case of circular LA and small Poisson call-arrival rate, we prove\nthe following: (1) When the drift is weak, the optimal initial position\napproaches the center of the LA; when the drift is strong, it approaches the\nboundary of the LA. (2) Comparing the optimal initial-position and\ncenter-initial-position solutions (which is assumed in most prior work), when\nthe drift is weak, the optimal distance threshold and the minimum total cost\nare roughly equal; when the drift is strong, the optimal distance threshold in\nthe later is about 1.260 times that in the former, and the minimum total cost\nin the later is about 1.587 times that in the former.

In the context of the expanding universe the\nkinematic interpretation corresponds to a family of comoving observers and\nhence is more natural.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2008 17:50:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 15:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

We decompose this\nincrease in average volatility and find that it is far from representative of\nthe experience of most people: there has been no systematic rise in volatility\nfor the vast majority of individuals. The rise in average volatility has been\ndriven almost entirely by a sharp rise in the income volatility of those\nexpected to have the most volatile incomes, identified ex-ante by large income\nchanges in the past.

(2006) to be a\nrotationally supported disk despite the fact that its high star formation rate\nand short gas consumption timescale require a very rapid acquisition of mass.\nPrevious kinematical analyses have suggested that z~2 disk galaxies like\nBzK-15504 did not form through mergers because their line-of-sight velocity\nfields display low levels of asymmetry. We perform the same kinematical\nanalysis on a set of simulated disk galaxies formed in gas-rich mergers of the\ntype that may be common at high redshift, and show that the remnant disks\ndisplay low velocity field asymmetry and satisfy the criteria that have been\nused to classify high-redshift galaxies as disks observationally. Further, we\ncompare one of our remnants to the bulk properties of BzK-15504 and show that\nit has a star formation rate, gas surface density, and a circular\nvelocity-to-velocity dispersion ratio that matches BzK-15504 remarkably well.\nWe suggest that observations of high-redshift disk galaxies like BzK-15504 are\nconsistent with the hypothesis that gas-rich mergers play an important role in\ndisk formation at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2008 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this work, we focus on a model of low-mass, star forming\ngalaxies at 1<~z<~2 that may host long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).\nObservations of GRB hosts have revealed a population of faint systems with star\nformation properties that often differ from Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and\nmore luminous high-redshift field galaxies. Observed GRB sightlines are\ndeficient in molecular hydrogen, but it is unclear to what degree this\ndeficiency owes to intrinsic properties of the galaxy or the impact the GRB has\non its environment.

In this paper, we study two more challenging, yet\nequally fundamental problems.\n  Subgraph connectivity asks to maintain an understanding of connectivity under\nvertex updates: updates can turn vertices on and off, and queries refer to the\nsubgraph induced by \"on\" vertices. (For instance, this is closer to\napplications in networks of routers, where node faults may occur.)\n  We describe a data structure supporting vertex updates in O (m^{2/3})\namortized time, where m denotes the number of edges in the graph. This greatly\nimproves over the previous result [Chan, STOC'02], which required fast matrix\nmultiplication and had an update time of O(m^0.94). The new data structure is\nalso simpler.\n  Geometric connectivity asks to maintain a dynamic set of n geometric objects,\nand query connectivity in their intersection graph. (For instance, the\nintersection graph of balls describes connectivity in a network of sensors with\nbounded transmission radius.)\n  Previously, nontrivial fully dynamic results were known only for special\ncases like axis-parallel line segments and rectangles. We provide similarly\nimproved update times, O (n^{2/3}), for these special cases.

We\nthen investigate numerically how a flow-normal magnetic field, and the\nassociated Hartmann steady state, affect the soft and hard instability modes of\nfree surface flow, working in the low magnetic Prandtl number regime of\nlaboratory fluids. Because it is a critical layer instability, the hard mode is\nfound to exhibit similar behaviour to the even unstable mode in channel\nHartmann flow, in terms of both the weak influence of Pm on its neutral\nstability curve, and the dependence of its critical Reynolds number Re_c on the\nHartmann number Ha. In contrast, the structure of the soft mode's growth rate\ncontours in the (Re, alpha) plane, where alpha is the wavenumber, differs\nmarkedly between problems with small, but nonzero, Pm, and their counterparts\nin the inductionless limit. As derived from large wavelength approximations,\nand confirmed numerically, the soft mode's critical Reynolds number grows\nexponentially with Ha in inductionless problems. However, when Pm is nonzero\nthe Lorentz force originating from the steady state current leads to a\nmodification of Re_c(Ha) to either a sublinearly increasing, or decreasing\nfunction of Ha, respectively for problems with insulating and conducting walls.\nIn the former, we also observe pairs of Alfven waves, the upstream propagating\nwave undergoing an instability at large Alfven numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2008 14:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Over half of these sources exhibited 2-10% rms variations on timescales\nover 2 days. We analyzed the variations by two independent methods, and find\nthat the rms variability amplitudes of the sources correlate with the emission\nmeasure in the ionized Interstellar Medium along their respective lines of\nsight. We thus link the variations with interstellar scintillation of\ncomponents of these sources, with some (unknown) fraction of the total flux\ndensity contained within a compact region of angular diameter in the range\n10-50 micro-arcseconds. We also find that the variations decrease for high mean\nflux density sources and, most importantly, for high redshift sources. The\ndecrease in variability is probably due either to an increase in the apparent\ndiameter of the source, or a decrease in the flux density of the compact\nfraction beyond z ~ 2.

Glass compositions at x < 0.095 are stressed-rigid,\nwhile those at x > 0.378 elastically flexible. Raman optical elasticity\npower-laws, trends in the nature of the glass transition endotherms corroborate\nthe three elastic phase assignments. Ionic conductivities reveal a step-like\nincrease when glasses become stress-free at x > xc(1) = 0.095, and a\nlogarithmic increase in conductivity (sigma ~ (x-xc(2)t) once they become\nflexible at x > xc(2) = 0.378 with a power-law t = 1.78.

We find that averaged\ninhomogeneous models can reproduce the observations without requiring an\nadditional Dark Energy component (though a volume acceleration is still\nneeded), and that current data do not disfavour our main assumption on the\neffective lightcone structure. We also show that the experimental uncertainties\non the angular diameter distance and the Hubble parameter from Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations measurements -- forseen in future surveys like the proposed EUCLID\nsatellite project -- are sufficiently small to distinguish between a FLRW\ntemplate geometry and the template geometry with consistently evolving\ncurvature.

The\ntemperature-extremum-extraction (TEE) method for obtaining the dynamic\ninformation of the LSC is presented. With this method, the azimuthal angular\npositions of the hot ascending and cold descending flows along the sidewall are\nidentified from the measured instantaneous azimuthal temperature profile. The\nmotion of the LSC is then decomposed into two different modes: the azimuthal\nmode and the translational or off-center mode. Comparing to the previous\nsinusoidal-fitting (SF) method, it is found that both methods give the same\ninformation about the azimuthal motion of the LSC, but the TEE method in\naddition can provide information about the off-center motion of the LSC, which\nis found to oscillate time-periodically around the cell's central vertical axis\nwith an amplitude being nearly independent of the turbulent intensity. It is\nfurther found that the azimuthal angular positions of the hot ascending flow\nnear the bottom plate and the cold descending flow near the top plate oscillate\nperiodically out of phase by $\\pi$, leading to the torsional mode of the LSC.\nThese oscillations are then propagated vertically along the sidewall by the hot\nascending and cold descending fluids. When they reach the mid-height plane, the\nazimuthal positions of the hottest and coldest fluids again oscillate out of\nphase by $\\pi$. It is this out-of-phase horizontal positional oscillation of\nthe hottest and coldest fluids at the same horizontal plane that produces the\noff-center oscillation of the LSC.

The high-redshift (z = 4:048) gamma-ray burst GRB 060206 showed unusual\nbehavior, with a significant rebrightening by a factor of ~ 4 at about 3000 s\nafter the burst. We argue that this rebrightening implies that the central\nengine became active again after the main burst produced by the first ejecta,\nthen drove another more collimated jet-like ejecta with a larger viewing angle.\nThe two ejecta both interacted with the ambient medium, giving rise to forward\nshocks that propagated into the ambient medium and reverse shocks that\npenetrated into the ejecta.

Our simulations re-scales observations of local galaxies or results\nfrom numerical simulations of disk or interacting galaxies. For the current\nanalysis, we limit ourselves to a local disk galaxy which exhibits simple\nrotation and a simulation of a merger. We have attempted to generalize our\nresults by introducing the simple concepts of \"PSF contrast\" which is the\namount of light polluting adjacent spectra which we find drives the smallest EE\nat a given spatial scale. The choice of the spatial sampling is driven by the\n\"scale-coupling\", i.e., the relationship between the IFU pixel scale and the\nsize of the features that need to be recovered by 3D spectroscopy in order to\nunderstand the nature of the galaxy and its substructure. Because the dynamical\nnature of galaxies are mostly reflected in their large-scale motions, a\nrelatively coarse spatial resolution is enough to distinguish between a\nrotating disk and a major merger. Although we used a limited number of\nmorpho-kinematic cases, our simulations suggest that, on a 42m telescope, the\nchoice of an IFU pixel scale of 50-75 mas seems to be sufficient. Such a coarse\nsampling has the benefit of lowering the exposure time to reach a specific\nsignal-to-noise as well as relaxing the performance of the MOAO system. On the\nother hand, recovering the full 2D-kinematics of z~4 galaxies requires high\nsignal-to-noise and at least an EE of 34% in 150 mas (2 pixels of 75 mas).\nFinally, we carried out a similar study at z=1.6 with a MOAO-fed spectrograph\nfor an 8m, and find that at least an EE of 30% at 0.25 arcsec spatial sampling\nis required to understand the nature of disks and mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2008 11:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Recently the present authors have been\njointly pursuing new lines of investigation into argumental interactions and\ntheir possible significance for the foundations of physics.

Our Distributed Tree\nConstruction (DTC) approach enables structured P2P networks to perform prefix\nsearch, range queries, and multicast in an optimal way. It achieves this by\ncreating a spanning tree over the peers in the search area, using only\ninformation available locally on each peer. Because DTC creates a spanning\ntree, it can query all the peers in the search area with a minimal number of\nmessages. Furthermore, we show that the tree depth has the same upper bound as\na regular DHT lookup which in turn guarantees fast and responsive runtime\nbehavior. By placing objects with a region quadtree, we can perform a prefix\nsearch or a range query in a freely selectable area of the DHT. Our DTC\nalgorithm is DHT-agnostic and works with most existing DHTs. We evaluate the\nperformance of DTC over several DHTs by comparing the performance to existing\napplication-level multicast solutions, we show that DTC sends 30-250% fewer\nmessages than common solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2008 13:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-11"}

Our work is related to that of Keiding (1991, 2006), who,\nusing a Markov process model, proposed estimators for the incidence rate from a\nprevalent cohort study \\emph{without} follow-up, under three different\nscenarios. However, each scenario requires assumptions that are both disease\nspecific and depend on the availability of epidemiologic data at the population\nlevel. With follow-up, we are able to remove these restrictions, and our\nresults apply in a wide range of circumstances. We apply our methods to data\ncollected as part of the Canadian Study of Health and Ageing to estimate the\nincidence rate of dementia amongst elderly Canadians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2008 14:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-11"}

In our model, the energy emitted by accreting\nblack holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic\nscale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jets\nthat heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. We present a\ncomprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observational\nmeasurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as cold\ngas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formation\nrates. We find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponential\ncutoff in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densities\nat z~0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely,\nquenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our model of\nself-regulated BH growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between BH\nmass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation history of galaxies in our\nmodels, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation,\nstellar mass assembly, cold gas, and metals. We find that models assuming the\n\"concordance\" LCDM cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass at\nhigh redshift (z>2). A model with less small-scale power predicts less star\nformation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellar\nmass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas in\nquasar absorption systems at high redshift (z~3-4).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2008 15:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We present here a theoretical investigation of\nthe mechanism of these reactions in vitro under thermal conditions (dilute\nsolutions of single-stranded chains, in the presence of molar concentrations of\nmonovalent salts and at elevated temperatures). The mechanism follows a\nKramers' process, whereby the complementary chains overcome a potential barrier\nthrough Brownian motion. The barrier originates from a single rate-limiting\nnucleation event in which the first complementary base pairs are formed. The\nreaction then proceeds through a fast growth of the double helix. For the DNA\nof bacteriophages T7, T4 and $\\phi$X174 as well as for Escherichia coli DNA,\nthe bimolecular rate $k_2$ of the reaction increases as a power law of the\naverage degree of polymerization $<N>$ of the reacting single- strands: $k_2\n\\prop <N>^\\alpha$. This relationship holds for $100 \\leq <N> \\leq 50 000$ with\nan experimentally determined exponent $\\alpha = 0.51 \\pm 0.01$. The length\ndependence results from a thermodynamic excluded-volume effect.
