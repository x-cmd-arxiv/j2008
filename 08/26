For the numerical realization we use star-by-star $N$-body\nsimulations. We find a very good agreement of theory and models.

The largely relaxed state of the\nsunspot shows a division in a central dark umbral region with bright dots and a\npenumbra showing bright filaments of about 2 to 3 Mm length with central dark\nlanes. By a process similar to the formation of umbral dots, the penumbral\nfilaments result from magneto-convection in the form of upflow plumes, which\nbecome elongated by the presence of an inclined magnetic field: the upflow is\ndeflected in the outward direction while the magnetic field is weakened and\nbecomes almost horizontal in the upper part of the plume near the level of\noptical depth unity.

The recently-discovered\nplanet f at 0.78 AU (Fischer et al. 2008) is located at the inner edge of a\npreviously-identified stable zone that separates the three close-in planets\nfrom planet d at 5.9 AU. Here we map the stability of the orbital space between\nplanets f and d using a suite of n-body integrations that include an\nadditional, yet-to-be-discovered planet g with a radial velocity amplitude of 5\nm/s (planet mass = 0.5-1.2 Saturn masses). We find a large stable zone\nextending from 0.9 to 3.8 AU at eccentricities below 0.4. For each system we\nquantify the probability of detecting planets b-f on their current orbits given\nperturbations from hypothetical planet g, in order to further constrain the\nmass and orbit of an additional planet. We find that large perturbations are\nassociated with specific mean motion resonances (MMRs) with planets f and d. We\nshow that two MMRs, 3f:1g (the 1:3 MMR between planets g and f) and 4g:1d\ncannot contain a planet g. The 2f:1g MMR is unlikely to contain a planet more\nmassive than about 20 Earth masses. The 3g:1d and 5g:2d MMRs could contain a\nresonant planet but the resonant location is strongly confined. The 3f:2g,\n2g:1d and 3g:2d MMRs exert a stabilizing influence and could contain a resonant\nplanet. Furthermore, we show that the stable zone may in fact contain 2-3\nadditional planets, if they are ~50 Earth masses each. Finally, we show that\nany planets exterior to planet d must reside beyond 10 AU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2008 16:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Yet\nit is the single most important handle we have in our understanding of one of\nthe most mysterious puzzle in nature, dark energy. This letter proposes a new\nmethod for measuring the EoS of dark energy by using the gravitational waves\n(GW) of black hole binaries. The method described here offers an alternative to\nthe standard way of large scale surveys.\n  It is well known that the mass of a black hole changes due to the accretion\nof dark energy but at an extremely slow rate. However, a binary of supermassive\nblack holes (SBH) radiates gravitational waves with a power proportional to the\nmasses of these accreting stars and thereby carries information on dark energy.\nThese waves can propagate through the vastness of structure in the universe\nunimpeded. The orbital changes of the binary, induced by the energy loss from\ngravitational radiation, receive a large contribution from dark energy\naccretion. This contribution is directly proportional to $(1+w)$ and is\ndominant for SBH binaries with separation $R \\ge 1000$ parsec, thereby\naccelerating the merging process for $w > -1$ or ripping the stars apart for\nphantom dark energy with $w < -1$.

We find that disk thickness plays an important, if not\ndominant, role in the evolution and structure of the bars. We also make\nextensive numerical tests of different N-body codes used to study bar dynamics.\nModels with thick disks typically used in this type of modeling\n(height-to-length ratio hz/Rd=0.2) produce slowly rotating, and very long,\nbars. In contrast, more realistic thin disks with the same parameters as in our\nGalaxy (hz/Rd= 0.1) produce bars with normal length Rbar approx R_d, which\nrotate quickly with the ratio of the corotation radius to the bar radius\n1.2-1.4 compatible with observations. Bars in these models do not show a\ntendency to slow down, and may lose as little as 2-3 percent of their angular\nmomentum due to dynamical friction with the dark matter over cosmological time.\nWe attribute the differences between the models to a combined effect of high\nphase-space density and smaller Jeans mass in the thin disk models, which\nresult in the formation of a dense central bulge. Special attention is paid to\nnumerical effects such as the accuracy of orbital integration, force and mass\nresolution. Using three N-body codes -- Gadget, ART, and Pkdgrav -- we find\nthat numerical effects are very important and, if not carefully treated, may\nproduce incorrect and misleading results. Once the simulations are performed\nwith sufficiently small time-steps and with adequate force and mass resolution,\nall the codes produce nearly the same results: we do not find any systematic\ndeviations between the results obtained with TREE codes (Gadget and Pkdgrav)\nand with the Adaptive-Mesh-Refinement (ART) code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2008 00:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In the\nfirst, one calculates the spectrum of the total light scattered by the system\nand obtains the incoherent part by subtracting the coherent part. In the second\nmethod, one introduces the fluctuation operators and obtains the incoherent\npart of the spectrum by taking the Fourier transform of the two time\ncorrelation function of the fluctuation operators. These two methods have been\nrecognized for years as two completely equivalent for evaluating the incoherent\npart of the spectrum. In a recent paper Qing Xu et al. [Phys. Rev. A 78, 013407\n(2008)] have shown that there are discrepancies between the incoherent parts of\nthe stationary spectrum of a three-level Lambda-type system calculated with\nthese two methods. The predicted discrepancies can be severe that over a wide\nrage of the Rabi frequencies and atomic decay rates, the spectrum calculated\nwith the variance method can have negative values. This is obviously unphysical\nresult since the fluorescence spectrum is a positively defined quantity. It\nrepresents the frequency distribution of light incoherently scattered by the\natomic system. Therefore, the calculated spectrum should be positive for all\nfrequencies independent of values of the Rabi frequencies and the damping\nrates. In this comment, we show that there are no discrepancies between these\ntwo methods. The equivalence of these two alternative methods leads to the same\nincoherent spectra that are positive for all frequencies independent of values\nof the parameters involved.

In a weak\nmagnetic field, it is found that the weak t_a region shows the unconventional\nquantization of the Hall conductance, \\sigma_{xy}=-(e^2/h)(2n+1), (n=0,\\pm\n1,\\pm 2,...), near the half-filling, while the strong t_a region shows only the\nconventional one, \\sigma_{xy}=-(e^2/h)n,(n=0,1,2,...). From topological nature\nof the Hall conductance, the existence of gap closing points and quantum phase\ntransitions in the intermediate t_a region are concluded. We also study\nnumerically the quantum phase structure in detail, and find that even when\nt_a=1, namely in graphene case, the system is in the weak t_a phase except when\nthe Fermi energy is located near the van Hove singularity or the lower and\nupper edges of the spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2008 03:51:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2008 05:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-03"}

Because massive star progenitors are expected to have their close-in\nsurroundings modified by the progenitor winds, we consider both free winds and\nshocked winds as possible external media for GRB remnant evolution.

For this reason, their detectability is highly biased in favor of\nthose with massive star progenitors; although, in this class of models, the\nbeamed component may be difficult to identify because the GRB ejecta is\neventually swept up by the accompanying SN.

While observational evidence shows that most of the decline in a star's\nX-ray activity occurs between the age of the Hyades (~8 x 10^8 yrs) and that of\nthe Sun, very little is known about the evolution of stellar activity between\nthese ages. To gain information on the typical level of coronal activity at a\nstar's intermediate age, we studied the X-ray emission from stars in the 1.9\nGyr old open cluster NGC 752. METHODS. We analysed a ~140 ks Chandra\nobservation of NGC 752 and a ~50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the same cluster.\nWe detected 262 X-ray sources in the Chandra data and 145 sources in the\nXMM-Newton observation. Around 90% of the catalogued cluster members within\nChandra's field-of-view are detected in the X-ray. The X-ray luminosity of all\nobserved cluster members (28 stars) and of 11 cluster member candidates was\nderived. RESULTS. Our data indicate that, at an age of 1.9 Gyr, the typical\nX-ray luminosity of the cluster members with M=0.8-1.2 Msun is Lx = 1.3 x 10^28\nerg s^-1, so approximately a factor of 6 less intense than that observed in the\nyounger Hyades.

On the\nother hand compelling experimental evidence for a strong electron-phonon\ninteraction (EPI) has currently arrived. Here I briefly review some\nphonon-mediated unconventional pairing mechanisms. In particular the anisotropy\nof sound velocity makes the phonon-mediated attraction of electrons non-local\nin space providing unconventional Cooper pairs with a nonzero orbital momentum\nalready in the framework of the conventional BCS theory with weak EPI. In the\nopposite limit of strong EPI rotational symmetry breaking appears as a result\nof a reduced Coulomb repulsion between unconventional bipolarons.

Data were obtained between 100 K and 600 K under zero and non-zero\nelectric field applied along the cubic [001] direction. The lowest energy,\nzone-center, transverse optic phonon is strongly damped and softens slowly at\nhigh temperature; however the square of the soft mode energy begins to increase\nlinearly with temperature as in a conventional ferroelectric, which we term the\nsoft mode \"recovery,\" upon cooling into the tetragonal phase at TC. Our data\nshow that the soft mode in PMN-0.32PT behaves almost identically to that in\npure PMN, exhibiting the same temperature dependence and recovery temperature\neven though PMN exhibits no well-defined structural transition (no TC). The\ntemperature dependence of the soft mode in PMN-0.32PT is also similar to that\nin PMN-0.60PT; however in PMN-0.60PT the recovery temperature equals TC. These\nresults suggest that the temperature dependence and the energy scale of the\nsoft mode dynamics in PMN-xPT are independent of concentration on the Ti-poor\nside of the MPB, but scale with TC for Ti-rich compositions. Thus the MPB may\nbe defined in lattice dynamical terms as the concentration where TC first\nmatches the recovery temperature of the soft mode. High-resolution x-ray\nstudies show that the cubic-to-ferroelectric phase boundary shifts to higher\ntemperatures by an abnormal amount within the MPB region in the presence of an\nelectric field.
