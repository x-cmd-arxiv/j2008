The dual\nstress-energy tensor is shown to be the Cotton tensor of the Dirichlet CFT. The\ntwo CFT's are related by a Legendre transformation generated by a gravitational\nChern-Simons coupling. This duality is a gravitational version of\nelectric-magnetic duality valid at any radius r, where the renormalized\nstress-energy tensor is the electric field and the Cotton tensor is the\nmagnetic field. Generic Robin boundary conditions lead to CFT's coupled to\nCotton gravity or topologically massive gravity. Interaction terms with CFT1\nlead to a non-zero vev of the stress-energy tensor in CFT2 coupled to gravity\neven after the source is removed. We point out that the dual graviton also\nexists beyond the linearized approximation, and spell out some of the details\nof the non-linear construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2008 19:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-27"}

Yet many\nphysicists continue to accept, usually on the reports of textbook writers and\nother commentators, that Bell's own view was wrong, and that, in fact, the\ntheorem only brings out a conflict with determinism or the hidden-variables\nprogram or realism or some other such principle that (unlike local causality),\nallegedly, nobody should have believed anyway. (Moreover, typically such\nbeliefs arise without the person in question even being aware that the view\nthey are accepting differs so radically from Bell's own.) Here we try to shed\nsome light on the situation by focusing on the concept of local causality that\nis the heart of Bell's theorem, and, in particular, by contrasting Bell's own\nunderstanding with the analysis of Jon Jarrett which has been the most\ninfluential source, in recent decades, for the kinds of claims mentioned\npreviously. We point out a crucial difference between Jarrett's and Bell's own\nunderstanding of Bell's formulation of local causality, which turns out to be\nthe basis for the erroneous claim, made by Jarrett and many others, that Bell\nmisunderstood the implications of his own theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2008 18:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

To improve the usual underutilization of the\ncellular uplink spectrum, this paper studies spectrum sharing between a\ncellular uplink and a mobile ad hoc networks. These networks access either all\nfrequency sub-channels or their disjoint sub-sets, called spectrum underlay and\nspectrum overlay, respectively. Given these spectrum sharing methods, the\ncapacity trade-off between the coexisting networks is analyzed based on the\ntransmission capacity of a network with Poisson distributed transmitters. This\nmetric is defined as the maximum density of transmitters subject to an outage\nconstraint for a given signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). Using tools from\nstochastic geometry, the transmission-capacity trade-off between the coexisting\nnetworks is analyzed, where both spectrum overlay and underlay as well as\nsuccessive interference cancelation (SIC) are considered. In particular, for\nsmall target outage probability, the transmission capacities of the coexisting\nnetworks are proved to satisfy a linear equation, whose coefficients depend on\nthe spectrum sharing method and whether SIC is applied. This linear equation\nshows that spectrum overlay is more efficient than spectrum underlay.\nFurthermore, this result also provides insight into the effects of different\nnetwork parameters on transmission capacities, including link diversity gains,\ntransmission distances, and the base station density. In particular, SIC is\nshown to increase transmission capacities of both coexisting networks by a\nlinear factor, which depends on the interference-power threshold for qualifying\ncanceled interferers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2008 18:35:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2008 07:38:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-18"}

Spitzer imaging shows that one of these components (B) is\ncoincident with an extremely red AGN, offset by ~4\" (~30 kpc) from the HzRG\ncore. The other submm component (A) - resolved by our beam and devoid of\nemission at 3.6-8.0um - lies between B and the HzRG core. Since the HzRG was\ndiscovered via its young, steep-spectrum lobes and their creation was likely\ntriggered by the interaction, we argue that we are witnessing an early-stage\nmerger, prior to its eventual equilibrium state. The interaction is between the\nhost galaxy of an actively-fueled BH, and a gas-rich starburst/AGN (B) marked\nby the compact submm component and coincident with broad CO emission. `A' is a\nplume of cold, dusty gas, associated with a narrow (~150 km/s) CO feature, and\nmay represent a short-lived tidal structure. It has been claimed that HzRGs and\nSMGs differ only in the activity of their AGNs, but such complex submm\nmorphologies are seen only rarely amongst SMGs. Our study has important\nimplications: where a galaxy's gas is not aligned with its central BH, CO may\nbe an unreliable probe of dynamical mass, affecting work on the co-assembly of\nBHs and spheroids. Our data support the picture wherein close binary AGN are\ninduced by mergers. They also raise the possibility that some supposedly\njet-induced starbursts may have formed co-evally with (yet independently of)\nthe radio jets, both triggered by the same interaction.

This problem\nfinds applications spanning from the mathematician's pencil, the processing of\ngranular materials, the jamming and glass transitions, all the way to fruit\npacking in every grocery. There are presently numerous experiments showing that\nthe loosest way to pack spheres gives a density of ~55% (RLP) while filling all\nthe loose voids results in a maximum density of ~63-64% (RCP). While those\nvalues seem robustly true, to this date there is no physical explanation or\ntheoretical prediction for them. Here we show that random packings of\nmonodisperse hard spheres in 3d can pack between the densities 4/(4 + 2 \\sqrt\n3) or 53.6% and 6/(6 + 2 \\sqrt 3) or 63.4%, defining RLP and RCP, respectively.\nThe reason for these limits arises from a statistical picture of jammed states\nin which the RCP can be interpreted as the ground state of the ensemble of\njammed matter with zero compactivity, while the RLP arises in the infinite\ncompactivity limit. We combine an extended statistical mechanics approach 'a la\nEdwards' (where the role traditionally played by the energy and temperature in\nthermal systems is substituted by the volume and compactivity) with a\nconstraint on mechanical stability imposed by the isostatic condition.\nUltimately, our results lead to a phase diagram that provides a unifying view\nof the disordered hard sphere packing problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2008 20:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 23:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-15"}

The\nMSA is time-consuming and is typically constructed only for a subset (few\nhundreds) of the most highly populated cities.

The\nCCA allows for the study of the underlying process leading to these deviations,\nshown to arise from the existence of long-range spatial correlations in the\npopulation growth.

Using a nanosized gold particle as\na reference pump wave source, we can collect 10 to 4 ~ 10 to 5 photons in\nsingle shot imaging where the signal from a single biomolecule is amplified and\nrecorded as 2D diffraction intensity data.

As an illustration of the phase-space method, we use the example of\nthe Ising model, which has exact solutions for the finite temperature canonical\nensemble in two dimensions. We show how a canonical ensemble for an Ising model\nof arbitrary structure can be efficiently simulated using SU(2) or atomic\ncoherent states.

To do this, we take a new approach to the\nsplitting of fast and slow potential forces: rather than splitting these forces\nat the level of the differential equations or the Hamiltonian, we split the two\npotentials with respect to the Lagrangian action integral. By using a different\nquadrature rule to approximate the contribution of each potential to the\naction, we arrive at a geometric integrator that is implicit in the fast force\nand explicit in the slow force. This can allow for significantly longer time\nsteps to be taken (compared to standard explicit methods, such as\nSt\\\"ormer/Verlet) at the cost of only a linear solve rather than a full\nnonlinear solve. We also analyze the stability of this method, in particular\nproving that it eliminates the linear resonance instabilities that can arise\nwith explicit multiple-time-stepping methods. Next, we perform some numerical\nexperiments, studying the behavior of this integrator for two test problems: a\nsystem of coupled linear oscillators, for which we compare against the\nresonance behavior of the r-RESPA method; and slow energy exchange in the\nFermi--Pasta--Ulam problem, which couples fast linear oscillators with slow\nnonlinear oscillators.
