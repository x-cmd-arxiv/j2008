In\nparticular, we examine a dynamical process that yields very low escape\nvelocities using nearly parabolic trajectories, and the reverse process that\nallows for low velocity capture. These processes are chaotic and provide a\nmechanism for minimal energy transfer that yield an increased transfer\nprobability compared to that of previously studied mechanisms that have invoked\nhyperbolic trajectories. We estimate the transfer probability in a stellar\ncluster as a function of stellar mass and cluster size.

In all sciences, besides quantum physics, all correlations are\ndescribed by either of two mechanisms. Either a first event influences a second\none by sending some information encoded in bosons or molecules or other\nphysical carriers, depending on the particular science. Or the correlated\nevents have some common causes in their common past. Interestingly, quantum\nphysics predicts an entirely different kind of cause for some correlations,\nnamed entanglement. This new kind of cause reveals itself, e.g., in\ncorrelations that violate Bell inequalities (hence cannot be described by\ncommon causes) between space-like separated events (hence cannot be described\nby classical communication). Einstein branded it as spooky action at a\ndistance. A real spooky action at a distance would require a faster than light\ninfluence defined in some hypothetical universally privileged reference frame.\nHere we put stringent experimental bounds on the speed of all such hypothetical\ninfluences. We performed a Bell test during more than 24 hours between two\nvillages separated by 18 km and approximately east-west oriented, with the\nsource located precisely in the middle. We continuously observed 2-photon\ninterferences well above the Bell inequality threshold. Taking advantage of the\nEarth's rotation, the configuration of our experiment allowed us to determine,\nfor any hypothetically privileged frame, a lower bound for the speed of this\nspooky influence. For instance, if such a privileged reference frame exists and\nis such that the Earth's speed in this frame is less than 10^-3 that of the\nspeed of light, then the speed of this spooky influence would have to exceed\nthat of light by at least 4 orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2008 09:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-26"}

However, there is no consensus for which\nphenomenon is the origin of which changes. A novel thixotropic model is defined\nthat incorporates aging. Conditions under which viscosity changes are due to\nthixotropy and aging are unambiguously defined. Viscosity changes in a complex\nfluid during a period of rest after destructuring exhibit a bifurcation at a\ncritical volume fraction PHIc2. For volume fractions less than PHIc2, the\nviscosity remains finite in the limit t => infinite. For volume fractions above\ncritical the viscosity grows without limit, so aging occurs at rest. At\nconstant shear rate there is no bifurcation, whereas under constant shear\nstress the model predicts a new bifurcation in the viscosity at a critical\nstress sB, identical to the yield stress sy observed under steady conditions.\nThe divergence of the viscosity for stress s sB is best defined as aging.\nHowever, for s > sB, where the viscosity remains finite, it seems preferable to\nuse the concepts of restructuring and destructuring, rather than aging and\nrejuvenation. Nevertheless, when a stress sA (sB) is applied during aging,\nslower aging is predicted and discussed as true rejuvenation. Plastic behaviour\nis predicted under steady conditions when s > sB. The Herschel-Bulkley model\nfits the flow curve for stresses close to sB, whereas the Bingham model gives a\nbetter fit for s >> sB.

Nanoparticles and colloids functionalized by four\nsingle strands of DNA can be thought of as designed analogs to tetrahedral\nnetwork forming atoms and molecules, with a difference that the attached DNA\nstrands allow for control of the length scale of bonding relative to the core\nsize.

We consider in detail several special cases. For quasi-concentric\ncylinders, we analyze the convergence of a perturbative evaluation based on\nsparse matrices. For concentric cylinders, we obtain analytically the\ncorrections to the proximity force approximation up to second order, and we\npresent an improved numerical procedure to evaluate the interaction energy at\nvery small distances. Finally, we consider the configuration of a cylinder in\nfront of a plane. We first show numerically that, in the appropriate limit, the\nCasimir energy for this configuration can be obtained from that of two\neccentric cylinders. Then we compute the interaction energy at small distances,\nand compare the numerical results with the analytic predictions for the first\norder corrections to the proximity force approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2008 15:09:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2008 20:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

At zero\ntemperature unidirectional and bidirectional single charge transfers occur. The\nunidirectional processes involve electrons injected from the source terminal\ndue to excess dc bias voltage. The bidirectional processes involve\nelectron-hole pairs created by time-dependent voltage bias. This interpretation\nis further supported by the charge transfer statistics in a multiterminal beam\nsplitter geometry in which injected electrons and holes can be partitioned into\ndifferent outgoing terminals. The probabilities of elementary processes can be\nprobed by noise measurements: the unidirectional processes set the dc noise\nlevel while bidirectional ones give rise to the excess noise. For ac voltage\ndrive, the noise oscillates with increasing the driving amplitude. The\ndecomposition of the noise into the contributions of elementary processes\nidentifies the origin of these oscillations: the number of electron-hole pairs\ngenerated per cycle increases with increasing the amplitude. The decomposition\nof the noise into elementary processes is studied for different time-dependent\nvoltages. The method we use is also suitable for systematic calculation of\nhigher-order current correlators at finite temperature. We obtain current noise\npower and the third cumulant in the presence of time-dependent voltage drive.\nThe charge transfer statistics at finite temperature can be interpreted in\nterms of multiple charge transfers with probabilities which depend on energy\nand temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2008 15:16:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2008 01:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-10"}

We demonstrate\nthat the electric-charge neutrality plays a similar role as the repulsive\nvector interaction; they both weaken the first-order chiral phase transition in\nthe high-density and low-temperature region. The first-order chiral phase\ntransition is not affected, however, at finite temperatures where the diquark\ncondensate melts. In this way the chiral phase transition could be second-order\nat intermediate temperatures if the diquark effects overwhelm the chiral\ndynamics, while the first-order transition may survive at lower and higher\ntemperatures. The number of the critical points appearing on the phase diagram\ncan vary from zero to three, which depends on the relative strength of the\nchiral and diquark couplings.

Recently we showed that for\nnon-cubic solids SC-QHA calculations develop deviatoric thermal stresses at\nhigh temperatures. Relaxation of these stresses leads to a series of\ncorrections to the free energy that may be taken to any desired order, up to\nself-consistency. Here we show how to correct the elastic constants obtained\nusing the SC-QHA. We exemplify the procedure by correcting to first order the\nelastic constants of MgSiO$_3$-perovskite and MgSiO$_3$-post-perovskite, the\nmajor phases of the Earth's lower mantle. We show that this first order\ncorrection is quite satisfactory for obtaining the aggregated elastic averages\nof these minerals and their velocities in the lower mantle. This type of\ncorrection is also shown to be applicable to experimental measurements of\nelastic constants in situations where deviatoric stresses can develop, such as\nin diamond anvil cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2008 15:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
