We find that\nnucleon dissociation sets in at about the saturation density, n_0, when the\ndown-quark Fermi sea is populated (d-quark dripline) due to the flavor\nasymmetry induced by beta-equilibrium and charge neutrality. At about 3n_0\nu-quarks appear and a two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase is formed.\nThe s-quark Fermi sea is populated only at still higher baryon density, when\nthe quark chemical potential is of the order of the dynamically generated\nstrange quark mass.

We review the considerable and wide-ranging evidence for the\ninvolvement of this combination of (su)peroxide and poorly liganded iron in a\nlarge number of physiological and indeed pathological processes and\ninflammatory disorders, especially those involving the progressive degradation\nof cellular and organismal performance.

The effective chelation of iron by natural or synthetic ligands is\nthus of major physiological (and potentially therapeutic) importance.

Such a formalism is presented\nhere, along with proposed resolutions to some of the issues discussed in the\nliterature. One in particular, the question of whether there can exist\nequilibria in a quantized version of a game that do not correspond to classical\ncorrelated equilibria of that game and also deliver better payoffs than the\nclassical correlated equilibria is answered in the affirmative for the\nPrisoner's Dilemma and Simplified Poker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Aug 2008 05:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-20"}

The null patterns we consider are random labeling (RL) and\ncomplete spatial randomness (CSR) of points from two or more classes, which is\ncalled CSR independence. The segregation and association patterns can be\nstudied using a nearest neighbor contingency table (NNCT) which is constructed\nusing the frequencies of nearest neighbor (NN) types in a contingency table.\nAmong NNCT-tests Pielou's test is liberal the null pattern but Dixon's test has\nthe desired significance level under the RL pattern. We propose three new\nmultivariate clustering tests based on NNCTs. We compare the finite sample\nperformance of these new tests with Pielou's and Dixon's tests and Cuzick &\nEdward's k-NN tests in terms of empirical size under the null cases and\nempirical power under various segregation and association alternatives and\nprovide guidelines for using the tests in practice. We demonstrate that the\nnewly proposed NNCT-tests perform relatively well compared to their competitors\nand illustrate the tests using three example data sets. Furthermore, we compare\nthe NNCT-tests with the second-order methods using these examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Aug 2008 15:04:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2008 14:33:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 08:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}

Many different carrier file\nformats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their\nfrequency on the Internet. For hiding secret information in images, there\nexists a large variety of steganographic techniques some are more complex than\nothers and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different\napplications have different requirements of the steganography technique used.\nFor example, some applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret\ninformation, while others require a larger secret message to be hidden. This\npaper intends to give an overview of image steganography, its uses and\ntechniques. It also attempts to identify the requirements of a good\nsteganographic algorithm and briefly reflects on which steganographic\ntechniques are more suitable for which applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Aug 2008 15:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-12"}
