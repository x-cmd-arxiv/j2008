Though the QHCs may be escaped Hilda asteroids, their origin and\nnature have not yet been studied in sufficient detail. Of particular interest\nare long TSCs/orbiters. Orbiters -- in which at least one full revolution about\nthe planet is completed -- are rare astronomical events; only four have been\nknown to occur in the last several decades. Every case has been associated with\na QHC: 82P/Gehrels 3; 111P/Helin-Roman-Crockett; P/1996 R2 (Lagerkvist); and\nthe possibly QHC-derived D/1993 F2 (Shoemaker-Levy 9, SL9). We focus on long\nTSC/orbiter events involving QHCs and Jupiter. Thus we survey the known QHCs,\nsearching for further long TSCs/orbiters over the past century. First, we\nconfirmed the long TSC/orbiter events of 82P, 111P, and 1996 R2 in order to\ntest our method against previous work, applying a general N-body Newtonian\ncode. We then used the same procedure to survey the remaining known QHCs and\nsearch for long TSC/orbiter events. We newly identified another long\nTSC/orbiter: 147P/Kushida-Muramatsu from 1949 May 14 (+97days/-106 days)--1961\nJuly 15. Our result is verified by integrations of 243 cloned orbits which take\naccount of the present orbital uncertainty of this comet. This is the third\nlong TSC and the fifth orbiter to be found, thus long TSC/orbiter events\ninvolving Jupiter have occurred once per decade. Two full revolutions about\nJupiter were completed and the capture duration was 12.17 (+0.29/-0.27) years;\nboth these numbers rank 147P as third among long TSC/orbiter events, behind SL9\nand 111P. This study also confirms the importance of the QHC region as a\ndynamical route into and out of Jovian TSC, via the Hill's sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2008 23:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
