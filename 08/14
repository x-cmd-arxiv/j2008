Coupling between large and small scale\nmodes boosts the power on small scales when the perturbations are small. On\nlarger scales power is slightly suppressed by the velocities perturbations on\nsmaller scales. The analysis is general, but we comment specifically on the\nimplications for future high-redshift observations, and show that the\nnon-linear spectrum has significantly more complicated angular structure than\nin linear theory.

Both statistics are the\nresult of how star formation takes place in DM halos, and thus are used to\nconstrain how UV light depends on halo properties such as mass. The two\nmeasures were taken from the GOODS data, thus ideal for joint analysis. The two\nphysical quantities we explore are the SF duty cycle, and the range of L_UV\nthat a halo of mass M can have (mean and variance). The former addresses the\ntypical duration of SF activity in halos while the latter addresses the\naveraged SF history and regularity of gas inflow into these systems. We explore\nvarious physical models consistent with data, and find the following: 1) the\ntypical duration of SF observed in the data is <0.4 Gyr (1 sig), 2) the\ninferred scaling law between L_UV and halo mass M from the observed slope of\nthe LFs is roughly linear at all redshifts, and 3) L_UV for a fixed halo mass\ndecreases with time, implying that the SF efficiency (after dust extinction) is\nhigher at earlier times. We explore several physical scenarios relating star\nformation to halo mass, but find that these scenarios are indistinguishable due\nto the limited range of halo mass probed by our data.

A positive temperature\nstep, however, leads to significant changes in the relaxation times. At short\ntimes, the dynamics are accelerated (rejuvenation), whereas at long times the\ndynamics are slowed (over-aging). All findings are in excellent qualitative\nagreement with recent experiments. The two regimes can be explained by the\ncompeting contributions of dynamical heterogeneities and faster aging dynamics\nat higher temperatures. As a result of this competition, the transition between\nrejuvenation and over-aging depends on the length of the square step, with\nshorter steps causing more rejuvenation and longer steps causing more\nover-aging.

One novel property is a version of\nthe fundamental three-term formula\nq(G)=q(G-a)+q(G^{ab}-b)+((x-1)^{2}-1)q(G^{ab}-a-b) that lacks the last term. It\nfollows that interlace polynomial computations can be represented by binary\ntrees rather than mixed binary-ternary trees. Binary computation trees provide\na description of $q(G)$ that is analogous to the activities description of the\nTutte polynomial. If $G$ is a tree or forest then these \"algorithmic\nactivities\" are associated with a certain kind of independent set in $G$. Three\nother novel properties are weighted pendant-twin reductions, which involve\nremoving certain kinds of vertices from a graph and adjusting the weights of\nthe remaining vertices in such a way that the interlace polynomials are\nunchanged. These reductions allow for smaller computation trees as they\neliminate some branches. If a graph can be completely analyzed using\npendant-twin reductions then its interlace polynomial can be calculated in\npolynomial time.

We study systematically the\neffects of pairing fluctuations and address all filling fractions over the\nentire range of attractive interaction strength. While the attractive Hubbard\nmodel can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this\nHubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong\ninter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling\nwhen the on-site attraction is strong. A central conclusion of our work is that\nin a lattice, around half filling, the smooth evolution from the BCS to the BEC\nlimits is interrupted. For the attractive Hubbard model, $T_c$ vanishes when\nthe system approaches the bosonic regime with increasing interaction strength.\nWe suggest that the vanishing of $T_c$ at strong coupling strength may signal a\nquantum critical transition to another form of superfluid not continuously\nconnected to a BCS-like phase. We present a simple variational ansatz for the\nground state in this more strongly coupled superfluid. We further generalize\nthe (s-wave) Hubbard model to d-wave pairing and address issues of potential\nrelevance to high temperature superconductors. For the d-wave case, we present\na phase diagram and show that here too, one observes a vanishing of $T_c$ when\nthe pairing onset temperature $T^*$ becomes sufficiently large.

When the equilibrium distribution function is a non-uniform\nfunction of the orbital angular momentum, the capture of stars into the\ncorotation resonance imbalances the disk angular momentum and triggers growing\nbar and spiral modes. The stellar disk can then recover its angular momentum\nbalance through the response of non-resonant stars. I carry out a complete\nanalysis of orbital structure corresponding to each Fourier component in the\nradial angle, and present a mathematical condition for the occurrence of van\nKampen modes, which constitute a continuous family. I discuss on the\ndiscreteness and allowable pattern speeds of unstable modes and argue that the\nmode growth is saturated due to the resonance overlapping mechanism. An\nindividually growing mode can also be suppressed if the corotation and inner\nLindblad resonances coexist and compete to capture a group of stars. Based on\nthis mechanism, I show that self-consistent scale-free disks with a sufficient\ndistribution of non-circular orbits should be stable under perturbations of\nangular wavenumber $m>1$.

For most parameter values the\naxis of rotation and the direction of linear momentum are perpendicular like in\na sliced tennis ball, while parallel orientation, like in a rifled bullet,\noccurs only for a small range of parameters. The limit of smooth spheres is\nsingular: any arbitrarily small roughness unavoidably causes significant\ntranslation-rotation correlations, whereas for perfectly smooth spheres the\nrotational degrees of freedom are completely decoupled from the dynamic\nevolution of the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2008 07:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-15"}

The small-scale extinction (spatial resolution\n$\\sim$0.3'') shows fluctuations that are most likely due to variations in the\ndust distribution. We compare the distribution of the extinction to that of the\ndust emission, traced by Spitzer emission at 8 and 24 \\mi, and to the emission\nof cold dust at 850 \\mi. We find in general a good agreement between all\ntracers, expect for the 850 \\mi emission in NGC 4214 which is more extended\nthan the extinction and the other emissions.

Red galaxies\nhave already become the dominant population in the cores of rich clusters at\nz~1, and the fraction of red galaxies has not strongly changed since then. The\nred fraction depends on richness of clusters in the sense that it is higher in\nrich clusters than in poor groups. The luminosity function of red galaxies in\nrich clusters is consistent with that in local clusters. On the other hand,\nluminosity function of red galaxies in poor groups shows a deficit of faint red\ngalaxies.

In particular, Parke and Taylor found a\nparticularly simple expression for the tree-level amplitudes with two gluons of\ndifferent helicity than the others (the so-called MHV amplitudes). Cachazo,\nSvrcek and Witten (CSW) devised rules for constructing tree-level amplitudes by\nsewing lower-valence MHV amplitudes together with scalar propagators. It was\nshown by Mansfield in 2005 that a canonical change of the field variables could\nbe constructed that resulted in a lagrangian whose vertices were proportional\nto MHV amplitudes, continued off-shell by CSW's prescription, the so-called\nCanonical MHV Lagrangian. We derive the explicit form of this transformation\nand use this to show that the vertices are indeed the Parke--Taylor amplitudes\nfor up to five gluons. Noting that CSW's MHV rules cannot be used to construct\nthe tree-level (-++) or one-loop (++++) amplitudes, we extend our work to\naugment the MHV rules with so-called completion vertices. These permit\nconstruction of these missing amplitudes by means of evasion of the S-matrix\nequivalence theorem. Indeed, together they reconstruct off-shell light-cone\nYang-Mills amplitudes algebraically. We also give a prescription for\ndimensional regularisation of the Canonical MHV Lagrangian. Finally, we\nconstruct a canonical MHV lagrangian with massless fermions in the fundamental\nrepresentation using a similar methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2008 10:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-15"}

Recently, some Class 0 protostars have been found to display\nconditions similar to what are found in hot cores that are associated with\nmassive star formation. These hot corino sources have densities, gas\ntemperatures, and methanol abundances that are adequate for exciting strong 6.7\nGHz maser emission. This raises the question of whether 6.7 GHz methanol masers\ncan be found in both hot corinos and massive star forming regions, and if not,\nwhether thermal methanol emission can be detected. We searched for the 6.7 GHz\nmethanol line towards five hot corino sources in the Perseus region using the\nArecibo radio telescope. To constrain the excitation conditions of methanol, we\nobserved thermal submillimeter lines of methanol in the NGC1333-IRAS 4 region\nwith the APEX telescope. We did not detect 6.7 GHz emission in any of the\nsources, but found absorption against the cosmic microwave background in\nNGC1333-IRAS 4A and NGC1333-IRAS 4B. Using a large velocity gradient analysis,\nwe modeled the excitation of methanol over a wide range of physical parameters,\nand verify that the 6.7 GHz line is indeed strongly anti-inverted for densities\nlower than 10^6 cm^-3. We used the submillimeter observations of methanol to\nverify the predictions of our model for IRAS 4A by comparison with other CH3OH\ntransitions. Our results indicate that the methanol observations from the APEX\nand Arecibo telescopes are consistent with dense (n ~ 10^6 cm^-3), cold (T ~\n15-30 K) gas. The lack of maser emission in hot corinos and low-mass\nprotostellar objects in general may be due to densities that are much higher\nthan the quenching density in the region where the radiation field is conducive\nto maser pumping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2008 12:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In previous papers and software, the\nasymptotic null distribution of likelihood ratio tests for detecting genetic\nlinkage in multivariate variance components models has been stated to be a\nmixture of chi-square distributions with binomial mixing probabilities. Here we\nshow, by simulation and by theoretical arguments based on the geometry of the\nparameter space, that all aspects of the previously stated asymptotic null\ndistribution are incorrect--both the binomial mixing probabilities and the\nchi-square components. Correcting the null distribution gives more conservative\ncritical values than previously stated, yielding P values that can easily be\nten times larger. The true mixing probabilities give the highest probability to\nthe case where all variance parameters are estimated positive, and the mixing\ncomponents show severe departures from chi-square distributions. Thus, the\nasymptotic null distribution has complex features that raise challenges for the\nassessment of significance of multivariate linkage findings.

Deriving $\\eta_{e\\mu}$, we take\ninto account the Landau damping in collisions of electrons and muons with\ncharged particles via the exchange of transverse plasmons. It lowers\n$\\eta_{e\\mu}$ and leads to the non-standard temperature behavior\n$\\eta_{e\\mu}\\propto T^{-5/3}$. The viscosity $\\eta_{n}$ is calculated taking\ninto account that in-medium effects modify nucleon effective masses in dense\nmatter. Both viscosities, $\\eta_{e\\mu}$ and $\\eta_{n}$, can be important, and\nboth are calculated including the effects of proton superfluidity. They are\npresented in the form valid for any equation of state of nucleon dense matter.\nWe analyze the density and temperature dependence of $\\eta$ for different\nequations of state in neutron star cores, and compare $\\eta$ with the bulk\nviscosity in the core and with the shear viscosity in the crust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2008 15:58:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2008 14:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-20"}
