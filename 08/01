For general power law potentials we calculate the effective\nequation of state parameter w_{eff}(z) in terms of the neutrino mass scale. Due\nto the interaction of the dark energy field (acceleron) with the neutrino\nsector, w_{eff}(z) is predicted to become smaller than -1 for z>0, which could\nbe tested in future cosmological observations. For the considered scenarios,\nthe neutrino mass scale additionally determines which fraction of the dark\nenergy is dynamical, and which originates from the cosmological constant like\nvacuum energy of the false vacuum. On the other hand, the field value of the\nacceleron field today as well as the masses of the right-handed neutrinos,\nwhich appear in the seesaw-type mechanism for small neutrino masses, are not\nfixed. This, in principle, allows to realise hybrid scenarios of neutrino dark\nenergy with a high-scale seesaw where the right-handed neutrino masses are\nclose to the GUT scale. We also comment on how MaVaN Hybrid Scenarios with\nhigh-scale seesaw might help to resolve stability problems of dark energy\nmodels with non-relativistic neutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2008 16:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2008 13:34:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 15:50:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-13"}

Deterministic line networks and two-dimensional random\nnetworks are considered. It is shown that when 1) the number of hops traversed\nbetween the source and destination grows large or 2) when the target success\nprobability approaches one or 3) when the number of transmit and/or receive\nantennas grows large, short-hop routing requires less energy than long-hop\nrouting.

In addition,\nnumerical analysis indicates that given loose outage constraints, only a small\nnumber of transmit antennas are needed for short-hop routing to have its\nmaximum advantage over long-hop routing, while given stringent outage\nconstraints, the advantage of short-hop over long-hop routing always increases\nwith additional transmit antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2008 23:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2008 00:13:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2009 00:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 02:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

This particular subset of the 'superdisk' radio galaxies is\nchosen because of a highly asymmetric location of the host elliptical galaxy\nrelative to the gap's central axis. In addition to posing a considerable\nchallenge to the existing models, such a morphology also means that the two\njets traverse highly unequal distances through the superdisk material. One thus\nhas a possibility to directly investigate if the marked asymmetry between the\ntwo jets' interaction with the (much denser) ambient medium, during their\npropagation, has a significant import for the brightness of the hotspot forming\nnear each jet's extremity. We also propose a new explanation for the formation\nof superdisks through the merger of a smaller elliptical galaxy with the\nmassive host, in which the gas attached to the infalling galaxy deposits its\nangular momentum into the host's circumgalactic gas, thereby causing it to\nflatten into a fat pancake, or superdisk. The asymmetric location of the host\ngalaxy can be assisted by the kick imparted to it during the merger.

Moreover, the detection is passive as the receiver does not switch\nhis measurements between two conjugate measurement bases to get the key.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2008 00:00:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 13:09:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 03:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Their models\nfailed. However the valid Genetic Code, provided by Nirenberg and Matthaei in\n1961, ignores many theoretical requirements for a perfect Code. Something is\nsimply missing from the canonical Code.\n  Results The 3x redundancy of the Genetic code is usually explained as a\nnecessity to increase the resistance of the mutation resistance of the genetic\ninformation. However it has many additional roles. 1.) It has a periodical\nstructure which corresponds to the physico-chemical and structural properties\nof amino acids. 2.) It provides physico-chemical definition of codon\nboundaries. 3.) It defines a code for amino acid co-locations (interactions) in\nthe coded proteins. 4.) It regulates, through wobble bases the free folding\nenergy (and structure) of mRNAs. I shortly review the history of the Genetic\nCode as well as my own published observations to provide a novel, original\nexplanation of its redundancy.\n  Conclusions The redundant Genetic Code contains biological information which\nis additional to the 64/20 definition of amino acids. This additional\ninformation is used to define the 3D structure of coding nucleic acids as well\nas the coded proteins and it is called the Proteomic Code and mRNA Assisted\nProtein Folding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2008 00:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-04"}

We focus on models in which the\noutflow is differential, namely in which the heavy elements (or some of the\nheavy elements) can leave the parent galaxy more easily than other chemical\nspecies such as H and He. We study the chemical evolution of galaxies in the\nframework of simple models. This allows us to solve analytically the equations\nfor the evolution of gas masses and metallicities. We find new analytical\nsolutions for various cases in which the effects of winds and infall are taken\ninto account. Differential galactic winds have the effect of reducing the\nglobal metallicity of a galaxy, with the amount of reduction increasing with\nthe ejection efficiency of the metals. Abundance ratios are predicted to remain\nconstant throughout the whole evolution of the galaxy, even in the presence of\ndifferential winds. One way to change them is by assuming differential winds\nwith different ejection efficiencies for different elements. However, simple\nmodels apply only to elements produced on short timescales, namely all by Type\nII SNe, and therefore large differences in the ejection efficiencies of\ndifferent metals are unlikely. Variations in abundance ratios such as [O/Fe] in\ngalaxies, without including the Fe production by Type Ia supernovae, can in\nprinciple be obtained by assuming an unlikely different efficiency in the loss\nof O relative to Fe from Type II supernovae. Therefore, we conclude that it is\nnot realistic to ignore Type Ia supernovae and that the delayed production of\nsome chemical elements relative to others (time-delay model) remains the most\nplausible explanation for the evolution of alpha-elements relative to Fe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2008 13:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The GHASP survey is now achieved and the whole\nsample is reduced using adaptive binning techniques based on Voronoi\ntessellations.

Their luminosity requires more than\n1 Msun of 56Ni ejected during the explosion, suggesting that they might have\noriginated from super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. However, the nature of\nthese objects is not yet well understood. In particular, no data have been\ntaken at late phases, about one year after the explosion. We report on Subaru\nand Keck optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of the SN Ia\n2006gz, which had been classified as being one of these \"overluminous\" SNe Ia.\nThe late-time behavior is distinctly different from that of normal SNe Ia,\nreinforcing the argument that SN 2006gz belongs to a different subclass than\nnormal SNe Ia. However, the peculiar features found at late times are not\nreadily connected to a large amount of 56Ni; the SN is faint, and it lacks [Fe\nII] and [Fe III] emission. If the bulk of the radioactive energy escapes the SN\nejecta as visual light, as is the case in normal SNe Ia, the mass of 56Ni does\nnot exceed ~ 0.3 Msun. We discuss several possibilities to remedy the problem.\nWith the limited observations, however, we are unable to conclusively identify\nwhich process is responsible. An interesting possibility is that the bulk of\nthe emission might be shifted to longer wavelengths, unlike the case in other\nSNe Ia, which might be related to dense C-rich regions as indicated by the\nearly-phase data.
