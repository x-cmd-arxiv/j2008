This connects\nthe breaking of SUSY to the generation of \\mu so that the same scale enters\nboth. Moreover, the messenger sector naturally realizes the D3-instanton\ntriggered Polonyi model of arXiv:0808.1286 so this scale is exponentially\nsuppressed relative to M_{GUT}.

Guruswami et al. (2005) propose this\nproblem and give logarithmic approximations (in the number of consumers) when\neach consumer's values for bundles are known precisely. Subsequently several\nversions of the problem have been shown to have poly-logarithmic\ninapproximability. This problem has direct ties to the important open question\nof better understanding the Bayesian optimal mechanism in multi-parameter\nsettings; however, logarithmic approximations are inadequate for this purpose.\nIt is therefore of vital interest to consider special cases where constant\napproximations are possible. We consider the unit-demand variant of this\nproblem. Here a consumer has a valuation for each different item and their\nvalue for a set of items is simply the maximum value they have for any item in\nthe set. We assume that the preferences of the consumers are drawn from a\ndistribution, the standard assumption in economics; furthermore, the setting of\na specific set of customers with known preferences, which is employed in all\nprior work in algorithmic pricing, is a special case of this general problem,\nwhere there is a discrete Bayesian distribution for preferences specified by\npicking one consumer uniformly from the given set of consumers. Our work\ncomplements these existing works by considering the case where the consumer's\nvaluations for the different items are independent random variables. Our main\nresult is a constant approximation that makes use of an interesting connection\nbetween this problem and the concept of virtual valuations from the\nsingle-parameter Bayesian optimal mechanism design literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2008 18:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-13"}

The mean\nfield-like theory replaces the rigid constraints of confinement with average\nconstraints, thus allowing us to develop a tractable method for treating a WLC\nwrapped on the surface of a sphere, and fully encapsulated within it. The\nefficacy of the theory is established by reproducing the exact correlation\nfunctions for a WLC confined to the surface of a sphere. In addition, the\ncoefficients in the free energy are exactly calculated. We also describe the\nbehavior of a surface-confined chain under external tension that is relevant\nfor single molecule experiments on histone-DNA complexes. The force-extension\ncurves display spatial oscillations, and the extension of the chain, whose\nmaximum value is bounded by the sphere diameter, scales as $f^{-1}$ at large\nforces, in contrast to the unconfined chain that approaches the contour length\nas $f^{-1/2}$.

Our sun must have rotated more rapidly in its past, as is\nsuggested by observations of many rapidly rotating young solar-type stars. Here\nwe explore the effects of more rapid rotation on the global-scale patterns of\nconvection in such stars and the flows of differential rotation and meridional\ncirculation which are self-consistently established. The convection in these\nsystems is richly time dependent and in our most rapidly rotating suns a\nstriking pattern of localized convection emerges. Convection near the equator\nin these systems is dominated by one or two nests in longitude of locally\nenhanced convection, with quiescent streaming flow in between at the highest\nrotation rates. These active nests of convection maintain a strong differential\nrotation despite their small size. The structure of differential rotation is\nsimilar in all of our more rapidly rotating suns, with fast equators and slower\npoles. We find that the total shear in differential rotation Delta Omega grows\nwith more rapid rotation while the relative shear Delta Omega/Omega_0\ndecreases. In contrast, at more rapid rotation the meridional circulations\ndecrease in energy and peak velocities and break into multiple cells of\ncirculation in both radius and latitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2008 19:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Hypernovae also appear to be associated with\nmildly relativistic jets or outflows, even in the absence of gamma-ray bursts.\nHere we consider radiation from charged particles accelerated in such mildly\nrelativistic outflows with kinetic energies of ~10^{50} erg. The radiation\nprocesses of the primarily accelerated electrons considered are synchrotron\nradiation and inverse-Compton scattering of synchrotron photons (synchrotron\nself-Compton; SSC) and of supernova photons (external inverse-Compton; EIC). In\nthe soft X-ray regime, both the SSC and EIC flux can be the dominant component,\nbut due to their very different spectral shapes it should be easy to\ndistinguish between them. When the fraction of the kinetic energy going into\nthe electrons (\\epsilon_e) is large, the SSC is expected to be important;\notherwise the EIC will dominate. The EIC flux is quite high, almost\nindependently of \\epsilon_e, providing a good target for X-ray telescopes such\nas XMM-Newton and Chandra. In the GeV gamma-ray regime, the EIC would be the\ndominant radiation process and the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST)\nshould be able to probe the value of \\epsilon_e, the spectrum of the electrons,\nand their maximum acceleration energy. Accelerated protons also lead to photon\nradiation through the secondary electrons produced by the photopion and\nphotopair processes.

While 3C111 meets most of the criteria for\na high-probability identification, like a bright flat-spectrum radio core and a\nblazar-like broadband SED, in the Third EGRET Catalog, the large positional\noffset of about 1.5 degrees put 3C111 outside the 99% probability region for\n3EGJ0416+3650, making this association questionable. We present a re-analysis\nof all available data for 3C111 from the EGRET archives, resulting in probable\ndetection of high-energy gamma-ray emission above 1000MeV from a position close\nto the nominal position of 3C111, in two separate viewing periods (VPs), at a\n3-sigma level in each. A new source, GROJ0426+3747, appears to be present\nnearby. For >100MeV, one source seems to account for most of the EGRET-detected\nemission of 3EGJ0416+3650. A follow-up Swift UVOT/XRT observation reveals one\nmoderately bright X-ray source in the error box of 3EGJ0416+3650, but because\nof the large EGRET position uncertainty, it is not certain that the X-ray and\ngamma-ray sources are associated.

The main goal in each of these applications is to obtain\nthe sparsest k-TC-spanners. We bring these diverse areas under the unifying\nframework of TC-spanners.\n  We initiate the study of approximability of the size of the sparsest\nk-TC-spanner for a given directed graph. We completely resolve the\napproximability of 2-TC-spanners, showing that it is Theta(log n) unless P =\nNP. For k>2, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a k-TC-spanner\nwith size within O((n log n)^{1-1/k}) of the optimum. Our algorithmic\ntechniques also yield algorithms with the best-known approximation ratio for\nwell-studied problems on directed spanners when k>3: DIRECTED k-SPANNER,\nCLIENT/SERVER DIRECTED k-SPANNER, and k-DIAMETER SPANNING SUBGRAPH. For\nconstant k>=3, we show that the size of the sparsest k-TC-spanner is hard to\napproximate with 2^{log^{1-eps} n} ratio unless NP \\subseteq DTIME(n^{polylog\nn}}). Finally, we study the size of the sparsest k-TC-spanners for H-minor-free\ngraph families. Combining our constructions with our insight that 2-TC-spanners\ncan be used for designing property testers, we obtain a monotonicity tester\nwith O(log^2 n /eps) queries for any poset whose transitive reduction is an\nH-minor free digraph, improving the Theta(sqrt(n) log n/eps)-queries required\nof the tester due to Fischer et al (2002).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2008 06:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-14"}

Particles are perturbed by a quadrupolar gravitational\npotential corresponding to a growing and secularly evolving bar. We find that\nouter rings with R1R2 morphology and pseudorings are exhibited by the\nsimulations even though they lack gaseous dissipation. Simulations with\nstronger bars form pseudorings earlier and more quickly than those with weaker\nbars. We find that the R1 ring, perpendicular to the bar, is fragile and\ndissolves after a few bar rotation periods if the bar pattern speed increases\nby more than ~ 8%, bar strength increases (by >~ 140%) after bar growth, or the\nbar is too strong (Q_T>0.3). If the bar slows down after formation, pseudoring\nmorphology persists and the R2 ring perpendicular to the bar is populated due\nto resonance capture. The R2 ring remains misaligned with the bar and increases\nin ellipticity as the bar slows down. The R2 ring becomes scalloped and does\nnot resemble any ringed galaxies if the bar slows down more than 3.5%\nsuggesting that bars decrease in strength before they slow down this much. We\ncompare the morphology of our simulations to B-band images of 9 ringed galaxies\nfrom the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey, and we find a\nreasonable match in morphologies to R1R2' pseudorings seen within a few bar\nrotation periods of bar formation. Some of the features previously interpreted\nin terms of dissipative models may be due to transient structure associated\nwith recent bar growth and evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2008 14:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-14"}
