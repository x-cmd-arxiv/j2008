Both\nsources are compact systems, contain jet-like (radio) structures, and harbor\nvery luminous O stars. A TeV signal has been found around the superior\nconjunction of the compact object in both objects, when the highest gamma-ray\nopacities are expected. We investigate the implications of finding TeV emission\nfrom Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039 around the superior conjunction, since this can\ngive information on the system magnetic field and the location of the TeV\nemitter. Using the very high-energy spectra and fluxes observed around the\nsuperior conjunction in Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039, we compute the absorbed\nluminosity that is caused by pair creation in the stellar photon field for\ndifferent emitter positions with respect to the star and the observer line of\nsight.

For the case of inefficient electromagnetic cascading, the expected\nsecondary synchrotron fluxes are compared with the observed ones at X-ray\nenergies.

Entanglement, a quantum phenomenon with no\nclassical counterpart, has been identified as an important and quantifiable\nresource in many areas of theoretical quantum information science, including\nquantum error correction, quantum cryptography, and quantum algorithms. We\nfirst investigate the equivalence classes of a particular class of entangled\nstates (known as graph states due to their association with mathematical\ngraphs) under local operations. We prove that for graph states corresponding to\ngraphs with neither cycles of length 3 nor 4, the equivalence classes can be\ncharacterized in a very simple way. We also present software for analyzing and\nmanipulating graph states. We then study quantum error-correcting codes whose\ncodewords are highly entangled states. An important area of investigation\nconcerning QECCs is to determine which resources are necessary in order to\ncarry out any computation on the code to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while\nsimultaneously maintaining a high degree of resistance to noise. We prove that\ntransversal gates, which are designed to prevent the propagation of errors\nthrough a system, are insufficient to achieve universal computation on almost\nall QECCs. Finally, we study the problem of creating efficient quantum circuits\nfor creating entangling measurements. Entangling measurements can be used to\nharness the apparent extra computing power of quantum systems by allowing us to\nextract information about the global, collective properties of a quantum state\nusing local measurements. We construct explicit quantum circuits that create\nentangling measurements, and show that these circuits scale polynomially in the\ninput parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2008 17:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-12"}

We study how the minimum\ncutsize increases with mean degree above this critical threshold, finding a new\nanalytical upper bound that improves considerably upon previous bounds.\nCombined with recent results on expander graphs, our bound suggests the unusual\nscenario that random graph bisection is replica symmetric up to and beyond the\ncritical threshold, with a replica symmetry breaking transition possibly taking\nplace above the threshold. An intriguing algorithmic consequence is that\nalthough the problem is NP-hard, we can find near-optimal cutsizes (whose ratio\nto the optimal value approaches 1 asymptotically) in polynomial time for\ntypical instances near the phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2008 17:59:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 01:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-27"}

Ramifications of viewing units of diversity in terms of\ninherent organization include the following: (1) Species, subspecies,\npopulation, deme, Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU), and related terms cannot\nbe distinguished on the basis of inherent organization and, consequently, do\nnot reflect a hierarchy of organization. In other words, only one model is\nrequired to explain systems composed of organisms. (2) Temporarily isolated\nnetworks of organisms possess the same intrinsic organization and, therefore,\nthe same ontological status as permanently isolated systems. (3) Units of\ndiversity are recognized regardless of kind or degree of divergence. (4) Fate\nis not an intrinsic property of systems and is an inappropriate consideration\nin species models.

We demonstrate that such nanoribbon always has a gap in its\nelectronic spectrum. Indeed, even in the situations where simple\nsingle-electron calculations predict a metallic dispersion, the system is\nunstable with respect to the deformation of the carbon-carbon bonds dangling at\nthe edges of the armchair nanoribbon. The edge bonds' deformation couples\nelectron and hole states with equal momentum. This coupling opens a gap at the\nFermi level. In a realistic sample, however, it is unlikely that this\ninstability could be observed in its pure form. Namely, since chemical\nproperties of the dangling carbon atoms are different from chemical properties\nof the atoms inside the sample (for example, the atoms at the edge have only\ntwo neighbours, besides additional non-carbon atoms might be attached to\npassivate unpaired covalent carbon bonds), it is very probable that the bonds\nat the edge are deformed due to chemical interactions. This chemically-induced\nmodification of the nanoribbon's edges can be viewed as an effective field\nbiasing our predicted instability in a particular direction. Yet by disordering\nthis field (e.g., through random substitution of the radicals attached to the\nedges) we may tune the system back to the critical regime and vary the\nelectronic properties of the system. For example, we show that electrical\ntransport through a nanoribbon is strongly affected by such disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2008 10:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-30"}

We\npostulate spin as the intrinsic feature of vacuum, in which the incident\nelectromagnetic radiation can create vortices with well defined spinning\nfrequency and completely undefined axis of rotation. The vortices have finite\nsurface determined by the spinning frequency that makes the peripheral speed\nequal to the velocity of light. According to the Lorentz equations of special\nrelativity, the product of radius and mass of rotating objects is independent\nof the frequency of rotation and it is equal to 3/4h/2pic for all fermions.\nThis invariance explains how the light with infinite spatial dimension and zero\nmass can produce finite mass and size for the particles in the pair-creation\nprocesses. The vortex model interprets the rest energy as the kinetic energy of\nspinning motion. The isotropic character of spinning can be represented by\nhelical motion with right or left-handed chirality corresponding to the duality\nof matter and anti-matter. Conservation rule is proposed for the chirality\nexplaining the electron-positron annihilation and the pair-creation processes.\nThe vortex induced field rotation around the particle can reproduce the\ngravitational formula if the curvature of field is derived from the Lorentz\ncontraction on the surface of rotating sphere.

It is defined\nas a subobject of the labelled coskeleton, the latter coinciding in the\nunlabelled case with the right adjoint to the truncation functor. This\nnon-functorial construction is necessary since the labelled coskeleton functor\nof the category of labelled precubical sets does not fulfil the above\nrequirement. We prove in this paper that it is possible to force the labelled\ncoskeleton functor to be well-behaved by working with labelled transverse\nsymmetric precubical sets.

The new tensor has associated\ninvariants $C\\cdot D$ and $D^2$, the first of these can be interpreted as a\nChern-Simons term for Weyl $C^2$ gravity. Both invariants allow various tensors\nto be constructed and some of the properties of these are investigated by using\nexact examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2008 15:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-13"}
