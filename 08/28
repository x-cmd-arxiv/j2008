We account for these high-curvature regions in terms\nof the stretching-ridge singularity believed to dominate the structure of\nstrongly deformed elastic membranes. Using a membrane fastened to itself to\nform a bag shape with a single stretching ridge, we show that the creation of\npoints of high boundary curvature lowers the interior ridge's energy. In the\nlimit of small thickness, the induced curvature becomes arbitrarily strong on\nthe scale of the object size and results in sharp edges connecting interior\nvertices to the boundary. REVISED: We analyze these edges as conical sectors\nwith no stretching. As the membrane size diverges, the edge energy grows as the\nsquare root of the central ridge energy. For comparison, we discuss the effect\nof truncating a stretching ridge at its ends. The effect of truncation becomes\nappreciable when the truncation length is comparable to the width of the\nuntruncated ridge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2008 18:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2008 22:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-23"}

The clearest evidence of\nthe interaction of the CMEs are the large temperature in the sheath, due to the\nshocks merging, and the brightness increase in coronagraphic images, associated\nwith the interaction of the leading edges. The importance of having multiple\nsatellites at different distances and angular positions from the Sun is also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2008 20:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-29"}

In this paper we apply an extended\nSoltan argument, connecting the local MBH mass function with the time-integral\nof the QSO luminosity function, to the demography of MBHs and QSOs from recent\noptical and X-ray surveys, and obtain robust constraints on the luminosity\nevolution (or mass growth history) of individual QSOs (or MBHs). We find that\nthe luminosity evolution probably involves two phases: an initial exponentially\nincreasing phase set by the Eddington limit and a following phase in which the\nluminosity declines with time as a power law (with a slope of -1.2--1.3) set by\na self-similar long-term evolution of disk accretion. Neither an evolution\ninvolving only the increasing phase with a single Eddington ratio nor an\nexponentially declining pattern in the second phase is likely. The period of a\nQSO radiating at a luminosity higher than 10% of its peak value is about\n(2-3)x10^8 yr, during which the MBH obtains ~80% of its mass. The\nmass-to-energy conversion efficiency is $0.16\\pm0.04 ^{+0.05}_{-0}$, with the\nlatter error accounting for the maximum uncertainty due to Compton-thick AGNs.\nThe expected Eddington ratios in QSOs from the constrained luminosity evolution\ncluster around a single value close to 0.5-1 for high-luminosity QSOs and\nextend to a wide range of lower values for low-luminosity ones. The Eddington\nratios for high luminosity QSOs appear to conflict with those estimated from\nobservations (~0.25) by using some virial mass estimators for MBHs in QSOs\nunless the estimators systematically over-estimate MBH masses by a factor of\n2-4. We also infer the fraction of optically obscured QSOs ~60-80%.

Recently, however, Baskaran and Grishchuk (2004\nClass. Quantum Grav. 21 4041) found that in a simple Michelson interferometer\nsuch errors can be as large as 10 percent. For more accurate analysis, these\nauthors proposed to use a linear-frequency correction to the long wavelength\napproximation. In this paper we revisit these calculations. We show that the\nlinear-frequency correction is inadequate for certain locations in the sky and\ntherefore accurate analysis requires taking into account the exact formula,\ncommonly derived from the photon round-trip propagation time. Also, we extend\nthe calculations to include the effect of Fabry-Perot resonators in the\ninterferometer arms. Here we show that a simple approximation which combines\nthe long-wavelength Michelson response with the single-pole approximation to\nthe Fabry-Perot transfer function produces rather accurate results. In\nparticular, the difference between the exact and the approximate formulae is at\nmost 2-3 percent for those locations in the sky where the detector response is\ngreater than half of its maximum value. We analyse the impact of such errors on\ndetection sensitivity and parameter estimation in searches for periodic\ngravitational waves emitted by a known pulsar, and in searches for an isotropic\nstochastic gravitational-wave background. At frequencies up to 1 kHz, the\neffect of such errors is at most 1-2 percent. For higher frequencies, or if\nmore accuracy is required, one should use the exact formula for the response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 00:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The cluster represents the final product of the star forming\nprocess and hosts an unobscured and near-complete initial mass function. NGC\n2362 is dominated by the O9 Ib multiple star, tau CMa, as well as several dozen\nunevolved B-type stars. Distributed throughout the cluster are several hundred\nsuspected intermediate and low-mass pre-main sequence members. Various\npost-main sequence evolutionary models have been used to infer an age of 5 Myr\nfor the one evolved member, tau CMa. These estimates are in close agreement\nwith the ages derived by fitting pre-main sequence isochrones to the\ncontracting, low-mass stellar population of the cluster. The extremely narrow\nsequence of stars, which extends more than 9 mag in the optical color-magnitude\ndiagram, suggests that star formation within the cluster occurred rapidly and\ncoevally across the full mass spectrum. Ground-based near infrared and H-alpha\nemission surveys of NGC 2362 concluded that most (~90%) of the low-mass members\nhave already dissipated their optically-thick, inner(< 1 AU) circumstellar\ndisks. Spitzer IRAC observations of the cluster have confirmed these results,\nplacing an upper limit on the primordial, optically thick disk fraction of the\ncluster at 7(+/-)2%. The presence of circumstellar disks among candidate\nmembers of NGC 2362 is also strongly mass-dependent, such that no stars more\nmassive than 1.2 Msun exhibit significant infrared excess shortward of 8\nmicrons. The well-defined upper main sequence of NGC 2362, its large population\nof low-mass stars, and the narrow age spread evident in the color-magnitude\ndiagram ensure its role as a standard model of cluster as well as stellar\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 02:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-29"}

During this transformation, two distinctive classes of\nelectronic excitations appear. At high energies, the enigmatic 'pseudogap'\nexcitations are found, whereas, at lower energies, Bogoliubov quasi-particles\n-- the excitations resulting from the breaking of Cooper pairs -- should exist.\nTo explore this transformation, and to identify the two excitation types, we\nhave imaged the electronic structure of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d in r-space and k-space\nsimultaneously. We find that although the low energy excitations are indeed\nBogoliubov quasi-particles, they occupy only a restricted region of k-space\nthat shrinks rapidly with diminishing hole density. Concomitantly, spectral\nweight is transferred to higher energy r-space states that lack the\ncharacteristics of excitations from delocalized Cooper pairs. Instead, these\nstates break translational and rotational symmetries locally at the atomic\nscale in an energy independent fashion. We demonstrate that these unusual\nr-space excitations are, in fact, the pseudogap states. Thus, as the Mott\ninsulating state is approached by decreasing the hole density, the delocalized\nCooper pairs vanish from k-space, to be replaced by locally translational- and\nrotational-symmetry-breaking pseudogap states in r-space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 02:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-29"}

In a speckle-limited regime, this method allows an\naccurate estimation and subtraction of the scattered starlight, to extract a\nclean spectrum of the planetary companion.

X-ray imaging\nsurveys, H-alpha emission surveys, and photometric variability studies have\nidentified more than 600 intermediate and low-mass members distributed\nthroughout the molecular cloud complex, but concentrated within two densely\npopulated areas between S Mon and the Cone Nebula. Estimates for the total\nstellar population of the cluster range as high as 1000 members and limited\ndeep photometric surveys have identified 230 substellar mass candidates. The\nmedian age of NGC 2264 is estimated to be 3 Myr, but an apparent age dispersion\nof at least 5 Myr can be inferred from the broadened sequence of suspected\nmembers. Infrared and millimeter observations of the cluster have identified\ntwo prominent sites of star formation activity centered near NGC 2264 IRS1, a\ndeeply embedded early-type star, and IRS2, a star forming core and associated\nprotostellar cluster. Given its relative proximity, well-defined stellar\npopulation, and low foreground extinction, the cluster will remain a prime\ncandidate for star formation studies throughout the foreseeable future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 06:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-29"}

Finally,\nwe suggest a measurement method to reveal the frequency dependence of current\npropagation in biological tissue, and which could be used to directly test the\npredictions of the present formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 09:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2008 09:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The peptide displays 71 alpha-helical structure\nwithout salt and destabilizes with the addition of NaCl in agreement with\nexperiments of a somewhat longer version.

NaI is found to be a stronger\ndenaturant than NaCl, while the potassium salts hardly show influence.\nInvestigation of the molecular structures reveals that consistent with recent\nexperiments Na+ has a much stronger affinity to side chain carboxylates and\nbackbone carbonyls than K+, thereby weakening salt bridges and secondary\nstructure hydrogen bonds. At the same time the large I- has a considerable\naffinity to the nonpolar alanine in line with recent observations of a large\npropensity of I- to adsorb to simple hydrophobes, and thereby 'assists' Na+ in\nits destabilizing action.

Although\nthe dead zones are stable, there is some transport due to the Reynolds stress\nassociated with waves emitted from the turbulent layers. We model the transport\nin each of the different regions by its own $\\alpha$ parameter, this being 10\nto $10^{3}$ times smaller in dead zones than in active layers. In\ngravitationally unstable regions, $\\alpha$ is determined by the fact that the\ndisk self-adjusts to a state of marginal stability. We construct steady-state\nmodels of such disks. We find that for uniform mass flow, the disk has to be\nmore massive, hotter and thicker at the radii where there is a dead zone. In\ndisks in which the dead zone is very massive, gravitational instabilities are\npresent. Whether such models are realistic or not depends on whether\nhydrodynamical fluctuations driven by the turbulent layers can penetrate all\nthe way inside the dead zone. This may be more easily achieved when the ratio\nof the mass of the active layer to that of the dead zone is relatively large,\nwhich in our models corresponds to $\\alpha$ in the dead zone being about 10% of\n$\\alpha$ in the active layers. If the disk is at some stage of its evolution\nnot in steady-state, then the surface density will evolve toward the\nsteady-state solution. However, if $\\alpha$ in the dead zone is much smaller\nthan in the active zone, the timescale for the parts of the disk beyond a few\nAU to reach steady-state may become longer than the disk lifetime. Steady-state\ndisks with dead zones are a more favorable environment for planet formation\nthan standard disks, since the dead zone is typically 10 times more massive\nthan a corresponding turbulent zone at the same location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 12:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The first one depends on the information about the current\nphase space distribution of DM particles only, while the second one uses both\nthe initial and final distributions. We discuss the recent data on dSphs as\nwell as astronomical uncertainties in relevant parameters. As an application,\nwe present lower bounds on the mass of DM particles, coming from various dSphs,\nusing both methods. The model-independent bound holds for any type of fermionic\nDM. Stronger, model-dependent bounds are quoted for several DM models (thermal\nrelics, non-resonantly and resonantly produced sterile neutrinos, etc.). The\nlatter bounds rely on the assumption that baryonic feedback cannot\nsignificantly increase the maximum of a distribution function of DM particles.\nFor the scenario in which all the DM is made of sterile neutrinos produced via\nnon-resonant mixing with the active neutrinos (NRP) this gives m_nrp > 1.7 keV.\nCombining these results in their most conservative form with the X-ray bounds\nof DM decay lines, we conclude that the NRP scenario remains allowed in a very\nnarrow parameter window only. This conclusion is independent of the results of\nthe Lyman-alpha analysis. The DM model in which sterile neutrinos are\nresonantly produced in the presence of lepton asymmetry remains viable.

The goal is\nto study how CAULDRON performs in an extreme case, and to determine which\ngalaxy properties can still be robustly recovered. Three data sets,\ncorresponding to orthogonal lines of sight, are generated from the N-body\nsystem and analysed with the identical procedure followed in the study of real\nlens galaxies, adopting an axisymmetric power-law total density distribution.\nWe find that several global properties of the N-body system are recovered with\nremarkable accuracy, despite the fact that the adopted power-law model is too\nsimple to account for the lack of symmetry of the true density distribution. In\nparticular, the logarithmic slope of the total density distribution is robustly\nrecovered to within less than 10 per cent (with the exception of the\nill-constrained very inner regions), the inferred angle-averaged radial profile\nof the total mass closely follows the true distribution, and the dark matter\nfraction of the system (inside the effective radius) is correctly determined\nwithin ~ 10 per cent of the total mass.

Nanoflares are small impulsive bursts of energy that blend with and\npossibly make up much of the solar background emission. Determining their\nfrequency and energy input is central to understanding the heating of the solar\ncorona. One method is to extrapolate the energy frequency distribution of\nlarger individually observed flares to lower energies. Only if the power law\nexponent is greater than 2, is it considered possible that nanoflares\ncontribute significantly to the energy input.\n  Aims. Time sequences of ultraviolet line radiances observed in the corona of\nan active region are modelled with the aim of determining the power law\nexponent of the nanoflare energy distribution.\n  Methods. A simple nanoflare model based on three key parameters (the flare\nrate, the flare duration time, and the power law exponent of the flare energy\nfrequency distribution) is used to simulate emission line radiances from the\nions Fe XIX, Ca XIII, and Si iii, observed by SUMER in the corona of an active\nregion as it rotates around the east limb of the Sun.

In face of its success, it is remarkable that there is\nlittle consensus on the actual degree of fairness achieved, particularly\nbearing its impact on quality of service in mind. In this paper we provide an\naccurate model for the fairness of the DCF. Given M greedy stations we assume\nfairness if a tagged station contributes a share of 1/M to the overall number\nof packets transmitted. We derive the probability distribution of fairness\ndeviations and support our analytical results by an extensive set of\nmeasurements. We find a closed-form expression for the improvement of long-term\nover short-term fairness. Regarding the random countdown values we quantify the\nsignificance of their distribution whereas we discover that fairness is largely\ninsensitive to the distribution parameters. Based on our findings we view the\nDCF as emulating an ideal fair queuing system to quantify the deviations from a\nfair rate allocation. We deduce a stochastic service curve model for the DCF to\npredict packet delays in IEEE 802.11. We show how a station can estimate its\nfair bandwidth share from passive measurements of its traffic arrivals and\ndepartures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 15:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
