To improve this nonlinearity result, we have firstly defined some\nsubsets of the n-variable Boolean functions as the \"generalized classes of\nk-RSBFs and k-DSBFs (k-Dihedral Symmetric Boolean Functions)\", where k is a\npositive integer dividing n and k-RSBFs is a subset of l-RSBFs if k < l.\nSecondly, utilizing the steepest-descent like iterative heuristic search\nalgorithm used previously to identify the 9-variable RSBFs with nonlinearity\n241, we have made a search within the classes of 3-RSBFs and 3-DSBFs. The\nsearch has accomplished to find 9-variable Boolean functions with nonlinearity\n242 in both of these classes. It should be emphasized that although the class\nof 3-RSBFs contains functions with nonlinearity 242; 1-RSBFs or simply RSBFs,\nwhich is a subset of 3-RSBFs, does not contain any. This result also shows that\nthe covering radius of the first order Reed-Muller code R(1, 9) is at least\nequal to 242. Thirdly, motivated by the fact that RSBFs are invariant under a\nspecial permutation of the input vector, we have classified all possible\npermutations up to the linear equivalence of Boolean functions that are\ninvariant under those permutations. Specifically, for 9-variable Boolean\nfunctions, 9! possible permutations are classified into 30 classes; and the\nsearch algorithm identifies some of these classes as \"rich\". The rich classes\nyield new Boolean functions with nonlinearity 242 having different\nautocorrelation spectra from those of the functions found in the generalized\n3-RSBF and 3-DSBF classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2008 17:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-06"}

A simple, purely geometrical model is constructed to describe the\ndifferent types of kink-mode oscillations. These are then `observed' from a\ngiven direction. In particular, we employ the 3D geometrical parameters of 14\nTRACE loops of transverse oscillations to try to identify the correct observed\nwave mode. We find that for many combinations of viewing and loop geometry it\nis not straightforward to distinguish between at least two types of kink modes\njust using time series of images.

Laue lenses have been developed by our\ncollaboration for several years : the main achievement of this R&D program was\nthe CLAIRE lens prototype. Since then, the endeavour has been oriented towards\nthe development of efficient diffracting elements (crystal slabs), the aim\nbeing to step from a technological Laue lens to a scientifically exploitable\nlens. The latest mission concept featuring a gamma-ray lens is the European\nGamma-Ray Imager (GRI) which intends to make use of the Laue lens to cover\nenergies from 200 keV to 1300 keV.\n  Investigations of two promising materials, low mosaicity copper and gradient\nconcentration silicon-germanium are presented in this paper. The measurements\nhave been performed during three runs on beamline ID15A of the European\nSynchrotron Radiation Facility, and on the GAMS 4 instrument of the Institute\nLaue-Langevin (both in Grenoble, France) using highly monochromatic beam of\nenergy close to 500 keV.

Silicon-germanium featuring a\nconstant gradient have been measured for the very first time at 500 keV. Two\nsamples showed a quite homogeneous reflectivity reaching 26%, which is far from\nthe 48% already observed in experimental crystals but a very encouraging\nbeginning.

We show that the reconstruction weights computed by\nLLE capture the high-dimensional structure of the neighborhoods, and not the\nlow-dimensional manifold structure. Consequently, the weight vectors are highly\nsensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear\nprojection of the input, as opposed to its non-linear embedding goal. To\novercome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using\na low-dimensional neighborhood representation. We prove theoretically that this\nstraightforward and computationally simple modification of LLE reduces LLE's\nsensitivity to noise.

Using this model to analyze some characteristic sequences\nfor which detailed experimental data on the melting is available [Montrichok et\nal. 2003 Europhys.

Especially the question of how pick-up ions form their\nsuprathermal tails, extending to far above their injection energies, still now\nis unsatistactorily answered. Though Fermi-2 velocity diffusion theories have\nrevealed that such tails are populated, they nevertheless show that resulting\npopulation densities are much less than seen in observations showing power-laws\nwith a velocity index of \"-5\". We first investigate here, whether or not\nobservationally suggested power-laws can be the result of a quasi-equilibrium\nstate between suprathermal ions and magnetohydrodynamic turbulences in energy\nexchange with eachother. We demonstrate that such an equilibrium cannot be\nestablished, since it would require too high pick-up ion pressures enforcing a\nshock-free deceleration of the solar wind. We furthermore show that Fermi-2\ntype energy diffusion in the outer heliosphere is too inefficient to determine\nthe shape of the distribution function there. As we can show, however,\npower-laws beyond the injection threshold can be established, if the injection\ntakes place at higher energies of the order of 100 keV. As we demonstrate here,\nsuch an injection is connected with modulated anomalous cosmic ray (ACR)\nparticles at the lower end of their spectrum when they again start being\nconvected outwards with the solar wind. Therefore, we refer to these particles\nas ACR-PUIs. In our quantitative calculation of the pick-up ion spectrum\nresulting under such conditions we in fact find again power-laws, however with\na velocity power index of \"-4\" and fairly distance-independent spectral\nintensities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2008 12:10:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 14:10:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 09:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
