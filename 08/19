We introduce a factorization formalism that can be\napplied to any desired observable, like event shapes or jet observables, for\nany number of jets and a wide range of jet algorithms in leptonic or hadronic\ncollisions. This is achieved by using soft-collinear effective theory to prove\nthe formal factorization of a generic fully-differential cross section in terms\nof a hard coefficient, and generic jet and soft functions. In this formalism,\nwhether a given observable factorizes in the usual sense, depends on whether it\nis inclusive enough, so the jet functions can be calculated perturbatively. The\nfactorization formula for any such observable immediately follows from our\ngeneral result, including the precise definition of the jet and soft functions\nappropriate for the observable in question. As examples of our formalism, we\nwork out several results in two-jet production for both e+e- and pp collisions.\nFor the latter, we also comment on how our formalism allows one to treat\nunderlying events and beam remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 16:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 07:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-18"}

At the\nsame time, in WIMPless models with hidden matter masses proportional to hidden\ngauge couplings squared, the hidden dark matter's thermal relic density may\nnaturally be in the right range, preserving the key quantitative virtue of\nWIMPs. We consider this possibility in detail. We first determine\nmodel-independent constraints on hidden sectors from Big Bang nucleosynthesis\nand the cosmic microwave background. Contrary to conventional wisdom, large\nhidden sectors are easily accommodated. A flavour-free version of the standard\nmodel is allowed if the hidden sector is just 30% colder than the observable\nsector after reheating. Alternatively, if the hidden sector contains a\n1-generation version of the standard model with characteristic mass scale below\n1 MeV, even identical reheating temperatures are allowed. We then analyze\nhidden sector freezeout in detail for a concrete model, solving the Boltzmann\nequation numerically and understanding the results from both observable and\nhidden sector points of view. We find that WIMPless dark matter indeed obtains\nthe correct relic density for masses in the range keV < m_X < TeV. The upper\nbound results from the requirement of perturbativity, and the lower bound\nassumes that the observable and hidden sectors reheat to the same temperature\nand is raised to the MeV scale if the hidden sector is 10 times colder.\nWIMPless dark matter therefore generalizes the WIMP paradigm to the largest\nmass range possible for viable thermal relics and provides a unified framework\nfor exploring dark matter signals across nine orders of magnitude in dark\nmatter mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 19:19:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2008 21:17:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 23:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-18"}

The high absorbing columns in these\nwinds, ~10^24 cm^-2, ensure that BALQSOs are generally X-ray faint. This high\nX-ray absorption means that almost all BALQSOs have been discovered through\noptical surveys, and so what little we know about their X-ray properties is\nderived from very bright optically-selected sources. A small number of X-ray\nselected BALQSOs (XBALQSOs) have, however, recently been found in deep X-ray\nsurvey fields. In this paper we investigate the X-ray and rest-frame UV\nproperties of five XBALQSOs for which we have obtained XMM-Newton EPIC X-ray\nspectra and deep optical imaging and spectroscopy. We find that, although the\nXBALQSOs have an alpha_ox steeper by ~0.5 than normal QSOs, their median\nalpha_ox is nevertheless flatter by 0.30 than that of a comparable sample of\noptically selected BALQSOs (OBALQSOs). We rule out the possibility that the\nhigher X-ray to optical flux ratio is due to intrinsic optical extinction. We\nfind that the amount of X-ray and UV absorption due to the wind in XBALQSOs is\nsimilar, or perhaps greater than, the corresponding wind absorption in\nOBALQSOs, so the flatter alpha_ox cannot be a result of weaker wind absorption.\nWe conclude that these XBALQSOs have intrinsically higher X-ray to optical flux\nratios than the OBALQSO sample with which we compare them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 16:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-25"}

To characterize the\nphenomena better and to compare with theory, a new larger experimental setup\nwith vacuum enclosure has been built. We here present first results in this\nsetup on positive streamers in air at fixed voltage and varying electrode\ndistance. While next to the emitting anode tip, a similar number of streamers\nseems to emerge due to multiple branching, more streamers seem to survive over\na fixed distance, when the gap is shorter. When lowering the voltage, streamers\nbranch less at all distances from the anode tip or do not branch at all beyond\na certain distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 17:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-19"}

Then the\nconstruction of the model requires the investigation of a singular perturbation\nproblem for an elliptic partial differential equation with a free boundary, for\nwhich we provide a method of solution to any desired order, with explicit\nsolutions to two orders. We outline the relevant parameter space, thus opening\nthe way to a systematic study of the properties of a two-parameter family of\nphysically justified non-spherical models of quasi-relaxed stellar systems. The\ngeneral method developed here can also be used to construct models for which\nthe non-spherical shape is due to internal rotation.

Broadband photometry with IRAC (3-10 micron), IRS (16 micron), and\nMIPS (24, 70 & 160 micron) was obtained as well as IRS spectroscopy spanning\n5.5-35 microns. A fit of stellar population models to the optical/near-IR/IRAC\nphotometry gives a young age (~9 Myr), forming stars at ~98 M_sun/yr, with a\ntotal stellar mass of ~10^9 M_sun formed thus far. The existence of an old\nstellar population with twice the stellar mass can not be ruled out. IR\nspectral energy distribution fits to the 24 and 70 micron photometry, as well\nas previously obtained submm/mm, data give an intrinsic IR luminosity L_IR =\n1-2 x10^11 L_sun and a star formation rate, SFR ~20-40 M_sun/yr. The UV derived\nstar formation rate (SFR) is ~3-5 times higher than the SFR determined using\nL_IR or L_Halpha because the red UV spectral slope is significantly over\npredicting the level of dust extinction. This suggests that the assumed\nCalzetti starburst obscuration law may not be valid for young LBGs. We detect\nstrong line emission from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) at 6.2, 7.7,\nand 8.6 microns. The line ratios are consistent with ratios observed in both\nlocal and high redshift starbursts. Both the PAH and rest-frame 8 micron\nluminosities predict the total L_IR based on previously measured relations in\nstarbursts. Finally, we do not detect the 3.3 micron PAH feature. This is\nmarginally inconsistent with some PAH emission models, but still consistent\nwith PAH ratios measured in many local star-forming galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Using an extensive suite of very high resolution (0.1 pc),\nadaptive mesh refinement, radiation hydrodynamical simulations of idealized and\ncosmological dwarf galaxies, we characterize the behavior of the escape\nfraction in galaxies between 3 x 10^6 and 3 x 10^9 solar masses with different\nspin parameters, amounts of turbulence, and baryon mass fractions.

This is\nparticularly motivated by recent indications from HYMORS. Exploiting high\nresolution, numerical simulations, we demonstrate that for both high and low\nenergy jets, always at high Lorentz factor, a transition to a higher density\nenvironment can cause a significant fraction of the directed jet energy to be\nlost on reflection. This can explain how one-sided jet deceleration and a\ntransition to FR I type can occur in HYMORS, which start as FR II (and remain\nso on the other side). For that purpose, we implemented in the relativistic\nhydrodynamic grid-adaptive AMRVAC code, the Synge-type equation of state\nintroduced in the general polytropic case by Meliani et al. (2004). We present\nresults for 10 model computations, varying the inlet Lorentz factor from 10 to\n20, including uniform or decreasing density profiles, and allowing for\ncylindrical versus conical jet models. As long as the jet propagates through\nuniform media, we find that the density contrast sets most of the propagation\ncharacteristics, fully consistent with previous modeling efforts. When the jet\nruns into a denser medium, we find a clear distinction in the decelaration of\nhigh energy jets depending on the encountered density jump. For fairly high\ndensity contrast, the jet becomes destabilised and compressed, decelerates\nstrongly (up to subrelativistic speeds) and can form knots. We point out\ndifferences that are found between cylindrical and conical jet models, together\nwith dynamical details like the Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities developing at\nthe original contact interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2008 21:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The corresponding inconsistent scale heights for dispersion measure\nand emission measure imply that the vertical profiles of mass and pressure in\nthe WIM are decoupled, and that the filling factor of WIM clouds is a geometric\nresponse to the competing environmental influences of thermal and non-thermal\nprocesses. Extrapolating the properties of the thick-disk WIM to mid-plane, we\ninfer a volume-averaged electron density 0.014 +- 0.001 cm^-3, produced by\nclouds of typical electron density 0.34 +- 0.06 cm^-3 with a volume filling\nfactor 0.04 +- 0.01. As one moves off the plane, the filling factor increases\nto a maximum of ~30% at a height of approximately 1-1.5 kpc, before then\ndeclining to accommodate the increasing presence of hot, coronal gas. Since\nmodels for the WIM with a ~1 kpc scale-height have been widely used to estimate\ndistances to radio pulsars, our revised parameters suggest that the distances\nto many high-latitude pulsars have been substantially underestimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2008 15:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Control issues to be addressed\nby controller design in this formalism include robust stability and robust\nperformance. Here robust performance is defined as the achievement of a uniform\nspecified $L^{2}$-gain tolerance for a disturbance-to-error map combined with\nrobust stability. By setting the disturbance and error channels equal to zero,\nit is clear that any criterion for robust performance also produces a criterion\nfor robust stability. Counter-intuitively, as a consequence of the so-called\nMain Loop Theorem, application of a result on robust stability to a feedback\nconfiguration with an artificial full-block uncertainty operator added in\nfeedback connection between the error and disturbance signals produces a result\non robust performance. The main result here is that this\nperformance-to-stabilization reduction principle must be handled with care for\nthe case of dynamic feedback compensation: casual application of this principle\nleads to the solution of a physically uninteresting problem, where the\ncontroller is assumed to have access to the states in the artificially-added\nfeedback loop. Application of the principle using a known more refined\ndynamic-control robust stability criterion, where the user is allowed to\nspecify controller partial-state dimensions, leads to correct\nrobust-performance results.

The basic field theory ideas under\nconsideration split into three separate categories. In the first, we argue that\nthe calculation of alpha'-corrections to MHV open string disk amplitudes\nreduces to the determination of certain classes of polynomials. This line of\nreasoning is then used to determine the alpha'^3-correction to the MHV\namplitude for all multiplicities. A second line of attack concerns the\nexistence of an analog of CSW rules derived from the Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld\naction in four dimensions. We show explicitly that the CSW-like perturbation\nseries of this action is surprisingly trivial: only helicity conserving\namplitudes are non-zero. Last but not least, we initiate the study of BCFW\non-shell recursion relations in string theory. These should appear very\nnaturally as the UV properties of the string theory are excellent. We show that\nall open four-point string amplitudes in a flat background at the disk level\nobey BCFW recursion relations.

Our\nobservations of the afterglow show an initial plateau in the lightcurve for\napproximately the first 5 to 25 minutes, then steepening to a powerlaw decay\nwith index alpha= 0.86 +/- 0.10 for the period between 1 to 24 hours post\nburst. This is consistent with the X-ray light-curve which shows an initial\nplateau followed by a similar subsequent decay. At late time, we detect a host\ngalaxy at the location of the optical transient. Gemini Nod & Shuffle\nspectroscopic observations of the host show a single emission line at 7167\nangstroms which, based on a grizJHK photometric redshift, we conclude is the\n3727 angstrom [O II] line. We therefore find a redshift of z=0.923. This\nredshift, as well as a subsequent probable spectroscopic redshift determination\nof GRB 070429B at z=0.904 by two other groups, significantly exceeds the\nprevious highest spectroscopically confirmed short burst redshift of z=0.546\nfor GRB 051221. This dramatically moves back the time at which we know short\nbursts were being formed, and suggests that the present evidence for an old\nprogenitor population may be observationally biased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2008 15:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2009 22:10:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2009 21:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
