The first approach,\ngenerally known as compartmental modeling, addresses the time evolution of\ndisease propagation at the expense of simplifying the pattern of transmission.\nThe second approach uses network theory to incorporate detailed information\npertaining to the underlying contact structure among individuals while\ndisregarding the progression of time during outbreaks. So far, the only\nalternative that enables the integration of both aspects of disease propagation\nsimultaneously while preserving the variety of outcomes has been to abandon the\nanalytical approach and rely on computer simulations. We offer a new analytical\nframework, which incorporates both the complexity of contact network structure\nand the time progression of disease spread. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nthis framework is equally effective on finite- and \"infinite\"-size networks.\nThis formalism can be equally applied to similar percolation phenomena on\nnetworks in other areas of science and technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2008 19:52:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 16:31:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2008 13:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2008 17:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-16"}

When working in the asymptotic vacuum, the leading modification\nscales as (H/Lambda)^alpha for all alpha, except for a discrete set where the\npower is higher.

It is shown that the linear superposition of\naction states and non-linear dynamics of the local dynamical variables form an\noscillons of energy representing non-local particles - \"lumps\" arising together\nwith their \"affine gauge potential\" agrees with Fubini-Study metric.\n  I use the conservation laws of local dynamical variables (LDV's) during\naffine parallel transport in complex projective Hilbert space $CP(N-1)$ for\ntwofold aim. Firstly, I formulate the variation problem for the ``affine gauge\npotential\" as system of partial differential equations \\cite{Le1}. Their\nsolutions provide embedding quantum dynamics into dynamical space-time whose\nstate-dependent coordinates related to the qubit spinor subjected to Lorentz\ntransformations of \"quantum boosts\" and \"quantum rotations\". Thereby, the\nproblem of quantum measurement being reformulated as the comparison of LDV's\nduring their affine parallel transport in $CP(N-1)$, is inherently connected\nwith space-time emergences. Secondly, the important application of these fields\nis the completeness of quantum theory. The EPR and Schr\\\"odinger's Cat\nparadoxes are discussed from the point of view of the restored Lorentz\ninvariance due to the affine parallel transport of local Hamiltonian of the\nsoliton-like field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2008 16:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-14"}

Until recently, even the existence of solar-climate variability has\nbeen controversial - perhaps because the observations had largely involved\ntemporary correlations between climate and the sunspot cycle. Over the last few\nyears, however, diverse reconstructions of past climate change have revealed\nclear associations with cosmic ray variations recorded in cosmogenic isotope\narchives, providing persuasive evidence for solar or cosmic ray forcing of the\nclimate. However, despite the increasing evidence of its importance, solar\nclimate variability is likely to remain controversial until a physical\nmechanism is established. Although this remains a mystery, observations suggest\nthat cloud cover may be influenced by cosmic rays, which are modulated by the\nsolar wind and, on longer time scales, by the geomagnetic field and by the\ngalactic environment of Earth. Two different classes of microphysical\nmechanisms have been proposed to connect cosmic rays with clouds: firstly, an\ninfluence of cosmic rays on the production of cloud condensation nuclei and,\nsecondly, an influence of cosmic rays on the global electrical circuit in the\natmosphere and, in turn, on ice nucleation and other cloud microphysical\nprocesses. Considerable progress on understanding ion-aerosol-cloud processes\nhas been made in recent years, and the results are suggestive of a physically-\nplausible link between cosmic rays, clouds and climate. However, a concerted\neffort is now required to carry out definitive laboratory measurements of the\nfundamental physical and chemical processes involved, and to evaluate their\nclimatic significance with dedicated field observations and modelling studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2008 17:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

Our aim is to study the\nphotometric properties of the bar and its HII regions, to elucidate the\nconditions under which HII regions form and their spatial relation to the\nprincipal dynamical features of the bar. Methods: We obtained BVRKs and Halpha\nphotometry of the HII regions of the bar in NGC 1530. Broad-band integrated\ncolours and Halpha equivalent widths were carefully measured and analysed as a\nfunction of position with respect to the main dust-lanes of the bar. Results:\nWe measured differences in the Halpha equivalent widths of the HII regions that\nare located in the trailing and leading sides of the bar dust-lane. The\npossible factors that could produce this difference, such as [NII]\ncontamination, Lyman-continuum-photon dust-extinction, escape of ionizing\nradiation, metallicity, IMF and age, were carefully analysed. Age differences\nwere confirmed to be the most plausible explanation. This implies that HII\nregions that are located further away from the bar dust-lane in its leading\nside, downstream from the main bar dust-lane, are older than the rest by\n~1.5-2.5 Myr. In addition, a clear spatial correlation has been found between:\nlocation of HII regions, dust spurs on the trailing side of the bar dust-lane,\nand the loci of maximum velocity gradients parallel to the bar major axis\n(possibly tracing gas flow towards the main bar dust-lane). These results\nsupport the hypothesis that massive stars are forming on the trailing side of\nthe bar dust-lane, and age as they cross the bar, on a timescale that is\ncompatible with the bar dynamics timescale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2008 19:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this\ncontext, we shall show that the interaction between the particles and\ntime-dependent fields induces a time-varying Aharonov phase. In this context,\nwe shall apply our results to a real matter wave interferometry experiment. We\nshall also show under which general conditions the geometry phase of a quantum\nopen system can be observed.Finally, we shall study the decoherence process\nduring a quantum phase transition. In this framework, we shall show that it can\nbe phrased easily in terms of the decoherence functional, without having to use\nthe master equation. To demonstrate this, we shall consider the decohering\neffects due to the displacement of domain boundaries, with implications for the\ndisplacement of defects, in general. We shall see that decoherence arises so\nquickly in this event, that it is negligible in comparison to decoherence due\nto field fluctuations in the way defined in previous papers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2008 21:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

This paradox is not a paradox in the true\nsense of a paradox but a reflection of a misunderstanding of the problem and\nthe Principle of Relativity. The currently accepted solution to this takes into\naccount the accelerations and deceleration of the traveling twin thus\nintroducing an asymmetry that solves the paradox. We argue here that, with the\nacceleration and deceleration neglected, the problem is asymmetric hence\nleading to the same conclusion that the traveling twin will age less than the\nstay at home. We introduce a symmetric twin paradox whose solution can not be\nfound within the currently accepted provinces of the STR if one adopts the\ncurrently accepted philosophy of the STR namely that it is impossible for an\ninertial observer to determine their state of motion. To resolve this, we\npresent (in our modest view) a simple and convincing argument that leads us to\nconclude that it must be possible for an inertial observer to determine their\nown state of motion. With this, we are able to solve the symmetric twin\nparadox. The fact that it is possible for an inertial observer to determine\ntheir state of motion -- brings us back to the long rejected idea of an all\npervading and permeating medium -- the Aether, namely the Lorentz luminiferous\nAether.

Using a semi-analytic approach, we investigate the composite wake\ndue to, and the resulting drag forces on, double perturbers that are placed at\nthe opposite sides of the orbital center and move on a circular orbit in a\nuniform gaseous medium. The circular orbit makes the wake of each perturber\nasymmetric, creating an overdense tail at the trailing side. The tail not only\ndrags the perturber backward but it also exerts a positive torque on the\ncompanion. For equal-mass perturbers, the positive torque created by the\ncompanion wake is, on average, a fraction ~40-50% of the negative torque\ncreated by its own wake, but this fraction may be even larger for perturbers\nmoving subsonically. This suggests that the orbital decay of a perturber in a\ndouble system, especially in the subsonic regime, can take considerably longer\nthan in isolation.

Typically a distribution of nanocrystal sizes and shapes emerges under\nthe uncontrolled aggregation of smaller clusters. The aim of this computational\nstudy is to investigate the evolution of the nanocrystal electronic states and\ntheir optical properties throughout their aggregation stages. To realistically\ntackle such systems, an atomistic electronic structure tool is required that\ncan accommodate about tens of thousand nanocrystal and embedding lattice atoms\nwith very irregular shapes. For this purpose, a computationally-efficient\npseudopotential-based electronic structure tool is developed that can handle\nrealistic nanostructures based on the expansion of the wavefunction of the\naggregate in terms of bulk Bloch bands of the constituent semiconductors. With\nthis tool, the evolution of the electronic states as well as the\npolarization-dependent absorption spectra correlated with the oscillator\nstrengths over their aggregation stages are traced. The low-lying aggregate\nnanocrystal states develop binding and anti-binding counterparts of the\nisolated states. Such information may become instrumental with the maturity of\nthe controlled aggregation of these nanocrystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Apr 2008 14:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-15"}

While only a highly diverse energy portfolio and\nconservation can ultimately guarantee optimum sustainability, based on a\ncomparison of current primary energy generation methods, it is argued that\nfuture energy strategy has to rely heavily on expanded coal and nuclear energy\nsectors. A comparison of relative potentials, merits and risks associated with\nfossil-fuel, renewable, and nuclear technologies suggests that the balance of\ntechnologies should be shifted in favor of new-generation, safe nuclear methods\nto produce electricity, while clean-coal plants should be assigned to\ntransportation fuel. Novel nuclear technologies exploit fission of uranium and\nthorium as primary energy sources with fast-spectrum and transmutation (burner)\nreactors. A closed fuel cycle and waste transmutation resolve the strategic\nissues associated with nuclear power. Innovative reactor designs utilize\nspallation of heavy metals in subcritical accelerator driven systems or\nmolten-salt reactors. Importation and reconstruction of technical expertise\nalready lost and aversion of further erosion are preconditions to any\nsuccessful energy strategy. Research opportunities to perfect innovative\nnuclear, coal, and renewable energy technologies should be pursued.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2008 21:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-15"}
