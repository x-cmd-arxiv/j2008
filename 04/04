By associating subhalos with cluster galaxies, we find the majority\nof galaxies in clusters experience no pre-processing in the group environment\nprior to their accretion into the cluster. On average, ~70% of cluster galaxies\nfall into the cluster potential directly from the field, with no luminous\ncompanions in their host halos at the time of accretion; and less than ~12% are\naccreted as members of groups with five or more galaxies. Moreover, we find\nthat cluster galaxies are significantly less likely to have experienced a\nmerger in the recent past (~6 Gyr) than a field halo of the same mass. These\nresults suggest that local, cluster processes like ram-pressure stripping,\ngalaxy harassment, or strangulation play the dominant role in explaining the\ndifference between cluster and field populations at a fixed stellar mass; and\nthat pre-evolution or past merging in the group environment is of secondary\nimportance for setting cluster galaxy properties for most clusters. The\naccretion times for z = 0 cluster members are quite extended, with ~20%\nincorporated into the cluster halo more than 7 Gyr ago and ~20% within the last\n2 Gyr.

The first two\nschemes are direct extensions of previously proposed schemes. The third scheme\nis novel, and it is directly inspired by rate-distortion theory of Gaussian\ncorrelated sources. For each scheme we derive the conditions under which the\nsystem achieves full multiplexing gain. The key difference with respect to the\nwidely treated frequency-flat case is that in MIMO-OFDM the frequency-domain\nchannel transfer function is a Gaussian correlated source. The new time-domain\nquantization scheme takes advantage of the channel frequency correlation\nstructure and outperforms the other schemes. Furthermore, it is by far simpler\nto implement than complicated spherical vector quantization. In particular, we\nobserve that no structured codebook design and vector quantization is actually\nneeded for efficient channel state information feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2008 19:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-04"}

WALT is poly-time sound: if a\nlambda-term M has type in WALT, M can be evaluated with a polynomial cost in\nthe dimension of the derivation that gives it a type. The evaluation proceeds\nunder any strategy of a rewriting relation which is a mix of both call-by-name\nand call-by-value beta-reductions. WALT weakens, namely generalizes, the notion\nof \"stratification of deductions\", common to some Light Systems -- those\nlogical systems, derived from Linear logic, to characterize the set of\nPolynomial functions -- . A weaker stratification allows to define a\ncompositional embedding of Safe recursion on notation (SRN) into WALT. It turns\nout that the expressivity of WALT is strictly stronger than the one of the\nknown Light Systems. The embedding passes through the representation of a\nsubsystem of SRN. It is obtained by restricting the composition scheme of SRN\nto one that can only use its safe variables linearly. On one side, this\nsuggests that SRN, in fact, can be redefined in terms of more primitive\nconstructs. On the other, the embedding of SRN into WALT enjoys the two\nfollowing remarkable aspects. Every datatype, required by the embedding, is\nrepresented from scratch, showing the strong structural proof-theoretical roots\nof WALT.

The mixed phase is obtained by the Gibbs conditions for finite\ntemperature. We adopt the equation of state based on the relativistic mean\nfield theory for the hadronic phase taking into account pions. As for the quark\nphase, the MIT bag model of the deconfined 3-flavor strange quark matter is\nused. As a result, our equation of state is thermodynamically stable and\nexhibits qualitatively the desired properties of hadron-quark mixed matter,\nsuch as the temperature dependence of the transition density. The pions raise\nthe transition density because they make the equation of state softer. Using\nthe equation of state constructed here, we study its astrophysical\nimplications. The maximum mass of compact stars is investigated, and our\nequation of state is consistent with recent observations. We also compute the\ncollapse of a massive star with 100 solar masses using our equation of state\nand find that the interval time from the bounce to the black hole formation\nbecomes shorter for the model with pions and quarks. The pions and quarks\naffect the total energy of the emitted neutrinos because the duration time of\nthe neutrino emission becomes shorter. The neutrino luminosity rises under the\neffect of pions since the density of the proto-neutron star becomes high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2008 08:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In some notable cases, typical\nlensing analyses assuming isothermal galaxy density profiles produce low values\nfor the Hubble constant, inconsistent with the result of the HST Key Project\n(72 +- 8 km/s/Mpc). Possible systematics in the values of the Hubble constant\nderived from galaxy lensing systems can result from a number of factors, e.g.\nneglect of environmental effects, assumption of isothermality, or contamination\nby line-of-sight structures. One additional potentially important factor is the\ntriaxial structure of the lensing galaxy halo; most lens models account for\nhalo shape simply by perturbing the projected spherical lensing potential, an\napproximation that is often necessary but that is inadequate at the levels of\ntriaxiality predicted in the CDM paradigm. To quantify the potential error\nintroduced by this assumption in estimates of the Hubble parameter, we strongly\nlens a distant galaxy through a sample of triaxial softened isothermal halos\nand use an MCMC method to constrain the lensing halo profile and the Hubble\nparameter from the resulting multiple image systems. We explore the major\ndegeneracies between the Hubble parameter and several parameters of the lensing\nmodel, finding that without a way to accurately break these degeneracies\naccurate estimates of the Hubble parameter are not possible. Crucially, we find\nthat triaxiality does not significantly bias estimates of the Hubble constant,\nand offer an analytic explanation for this behaviour in the case of isothermal\nprofiles. Neglected triaxial halo shape cannot contribute to the low Hubble\nconstant values derived in a number of galaxy lens systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2008 10:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 12:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-29"}

Here, we argue that cosmic rays can be accelerated by\nlarge amplitude electromagnetic waves (LAEMWs) when the MHD approximation of\nthe field in the wind generated by the GRB's magnetized central engine breaks\ndown. The central engine considered here is a strange star born with\ndifferential rotation from the accretion induced conversion of a neutron star\ninto a strange star in a low-mass X-ray binary system. The LAEMWs generated\nthis way accelerate light ions to the highest energies $E =\nq\\eta\\Delta\\Phi_{max}$ with an efficiency $\\eta \\sim 10^{-1}$ that accounts for\nall plausible energy losses.

We propose two\nmethods for the estimation of the transformation parameter: maximizing a\nprofile likelihood function or minimizing the mean squared distance from\nindependence. First the problem of identification of such models is discussed.\nWe then state asymptotic results for a general class of nonparametric\nestimators. Finally, we give some particular examples of nonparametric\nestimators of transformed separable models. The small sample performance is\nstudied in several simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2008 12:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

A structured fluorescence\nband between 300 nm and 350 nm is assigned to impurity-band transition and its\ncomplex lineshape is attributed to phonon replicas. An additional band at 340\nnm, assigned to VN vacancies on surface, is observed under vacuum and quenched\nby adsorbed molecular oxygen. UV-irradiation of h-BN under vacuum results in a\nbroad asymmetric fluorescence at ~400 nm assigned to m-VN vacancies; further\nirradiation breaks more B-N bonds enriching the surface with elemental boron.\nHowever, no boron deposit appears under irradiation of samples in ambient\natmosphere. This effect is explained by oxygen healing of radiation-induced\nsurface defects.
