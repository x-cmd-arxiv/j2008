The rotation velocities quickly increase from the galactic\ncenter and then achieve a constant velocity from the core to the periphery. The\nbasic dynamic behavior of a mature spiral galaxy, such as the Milky Way, is\nwell described by simple models balancing Newtonian gravitational forces\nagainst the centrifugal forces associated with a rotating thin axisymmetric\ndisk. In this research, we investigate the effects of adding central bulges to\nthin disk gravitational models. Even with the addition of substantial central\nbulges, all the critical essential features of our thin disk gravitational\nmodels are preserved. (1) Balancing Newtonian gravitational and centrifugal\nforces at every point within the disk yields computed radial mass distributions\nthat describe the measured rotation velocity profiles of mature spiral galaxies\nsuccessfully. (2) There is no need for gravity deviations or ``massive\nperipheral spherical halos of mysterious Dark Matter''. (3) The calculated\ntotal galactic masses are in good agreement with star count data. (4) The\naddition of central bulges increases the calculated total galactic masses,\npossibly more consistent with the presence of galactic gases, dust, grains,\nlumps, planets and plasma in addition to stars. (5) Compared with the light\ndistribution, our mass distributions within the disk are larger out toward the\ngalactic periphery which is cooler with lower opactiy/emissivity (and thus\ndarker). This is apparent from edge-on views of galaxies which display a dark\ndisk-line against a much brighter galactic halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Apr 2008 16:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-22"}

Particularly in the presence of strong local\ncorrelations, a local approach to the problem, combining a powerful method for\nthe short ranged interactions with the lattice propagation part of the\ndynamics, determines the quality of results to a large extent. For a\nconsiderable time the non crossing approximation (NCA) in direct perturbation\ntheory, an approach originally developed by Keiter for the Anderson impurity\nmodel, built a standard for the description of the local dynamics of\ninteracting electrons. In the last couple of years exact methods like the\nnumerical renormalization group (NRG) as pioneered by Wilson, have surpassed\nthis approximation as regarding the description of the low energy regime.

The global SED of M101 shows strong aromatic feature (commonly\ncalled PAH feature) emission. The spatially resolved spectral and photometric\nmeasurements of the aromatic feature emission show strong variations with\nsignificantly weaker emission at larger radii. We compare these variations with\nchanges in the ionization index (as measured by [NeIII]/[NeII] and [SIV/SIII],\nwhich we probe over the ranges 0.03-20 and 0.044-15 respectively) and\nmetallicity (expressed as log(O/H)+12, which ranges from 8.1 to 8.8). Over\nthese ranges, the spectroscopic equivalent widths of the aromatic features from\n7 HII regions and the nucleus were found to correlate better with ionization\nindex than with metallicity. This implies that the weakening of the aromatic\nemission in massive star forming regions is due primarily to processing of the\ndust grains in these environments, not to differences in how they form\n(although formation could still be important on a secondary basis). The\nbehavior of the correlation between the aromatic feature equivalent widths and\nionization index can be described as a constant equivalent width until a\nthreshold in ionization index is reached ([NeIII]/[NeII] ~ 1), above which the\nequivalent widths decrease with a power law dependence. This behavior for M101\nHII regions is also seen for the sample of starburst galaxies presented in the\ncompanion study of Engelbracht et al.

Most contour-based shape analysis methods can not be used to\ncharacterize such cells because of overlaps between neuronal processes. The\nproposed framework is specifically aimed at the problem of contour following\neven in presence of multiple overlaps. First, the input image is preprocessed\nin order to obtain an 8-connected skeleton with one-pixel-wide branches, as\nwell as a set of critical regions (i.e., bifurcations and crossings). Next, for\neach subtree, the tracking stage iteratively labels all valid pixel of\nbranches, up to a critical region, where it determines the suitable direction\nto proceed. Finally, the labeled skeleton segments are followed in order to\nyield the parametric contour of the neuronal shape under analysis. The reported\nsystem was successfully tested with respect to several images and the results\nfrom a set of three neuron images are presented here, each pertaining to a\ndifferent class, i.e. alpha, delta and epsilon ganglion cells, containing a\ntotal of 34 crossings. The algorithms successfully got across all these\noverlaps. The method has also been found to exhibit robustness even for images\nwith close parallel segments. The proposed method is robust and may be\nimplemented in an efficient manner. The introduction of this approach should\npave the way for more systematic application of contour-based shape analysis\nmethods in neuronal morphology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2008 04:03:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 16:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-24"}

Two multiple-access techniques are considered for scheduling\ntransmissions from each MT to the BS at the same frequency, which are\nspace-division multiple-access (SDMA) and time-division multiple-access (TDMA).\nFor SDMA, all MTs transmit simultaneously to the BS and their individual\nsignals are resolved at the BS via multiple receive antennas while for TDMA,\neach MT transmits independently to the BS during mutually orthogonal time\nslots. It is assumed that the channel-state information (CSI) of the fading\nchannel from each MT to the BS is unknown at each MT transmitter, but is\nperfectly known at the BS receiver. Thereby, the BS can acquire the long-term\nchannel-distribution information (CDI) for each MT. This paper extends the\nwell-known transmit-covariance feedback scheme for the point-to-point fading\nMIMO channel to the fading MIMO-MAC, whereby the BS jointly optimizes the\ntransmit signal covariance matrices for all MTs based on their CDI, and then\nsends each transmit covariance matrix back to the corresponding MT via a\nfeedback channel. The main goal of this paper is to characterize the so-called\nmultiuser power region under the multiuser transmit-covariance feedback scheme\nfor both SDMA and TDMA. The power region is defined as the constitution of all\nuser transmit power-tuples that can achieve reliable transmissions for a given\nset of user target rates. Simulation results show that SDMA can achieve\nsubstantial power savings over TDMA for the fading MIMO-MAC. Moreover, this\npaper demonstrates the usefulness of the multiuser power region for maintaining\nproportionally-fair power consumption among the MTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2008 10:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-22"}

Depending on these parameters we identify four qualitatively\ndifferent regimes. One of these regimes is especially interesting since it is\nfundamentally a consequence of the heterogeneous nature of links in a network\nand does not occur in the point-to-point case; the network capacity is {\\em\nboth} power and bandwidth limited. This regime has thus far remained hidden due\nto the limitations of the existing formulation. Existing schemes, either\nmultihop transmission or hierarchical cooperation, fail to achieve capacity in\nthis regime; we propose a new hybrid scheme that achieves capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2008 13:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 11:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

We present here a fully-relativistic (spin-orbit\ncoupling included) pseudo-potential density functional calculation of\nelectronic and magnetic properties, and of Landauer ballistic conductance of Pt\nmodel nanocontacts consisting of short nanowire segments suspended between Pt\nleads or tips, reprented by bulk planes. Even if short, and despite the\nnonmagnetic Pt leads, the nanocontact is found to be locally magnetic with\nmagnetization strictly parallel to its axis. Especially under strain, the\nenergy barrier to flip the overall spin direction is predicted to be tens of\nmeV high, and thus the corresponding blocking temperatures large, suggesting\nthe use of static Landauer ballistic electrical conductance calculations. We\ncarry out such calculations, to find that inclusion of spin-orbit coupling and\nof magnetism lowers the ballistic conductance by about $15\\div20$% relative to\nthe nonmagnetic case, yielding $ G\\sim 2 G_0$ ($G_0=2e^2/h$), in good agreement\nwith break junction results. The spin filtering properties of this highly\nunusual spontaneously magnetic nanocontact are also analysed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2008 15:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-22"}
