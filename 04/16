We derive the unique\nperturbative tachyon potential consistent with a full class of linearized\ntachyonic deformations of supercritical string theory. The solutions of\ninterest deform a general linear dilaton background by the insertion of purely\nexponential tachyon vertex operators. In spacetime, the evolution of the\ntachyon drives an accelerated contraction of the universe and, absent\nhigher-order corrections, the theory collapses to a cosmological singularity in\nfinite time, at arbitrarily weak string coupling. When the tachyon exhibits a\nnull symmetry, the worldsheet dynamics are known to be exact and well-defined\nat tree level. We prove that if the two-derivative effective action is free of\nnon-gravitational singularities, higher-order corrections always resolve the\nspacetime curvature singularity of the null tachyon. The resulting theory\nprovides an explicit mechanism by which tachyon condensation can generate or\nterminate the flow of cosmological time in string theory. Additional particular\nsolutions can resolve an initial singularity with a tachyonic phase at weak\ncoupling, or yield solitonic configurations that localize the universe along\nspatial directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2008 19:51:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 19:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

To determine the\nimpact of binarity on planetary nebula formation and shaping, we need to\ndetermine the central star of planetary nebula binary fraction and period\ndistribution. The short-period binary fraction has been known to be 10-15% from\na survey of ~100 central stars for photometric variability indicative of\nirradiation effects, ellipsoidal variability or eclipses. This survey technique\nis known to be biased against binaries with long periods and this fact is used\nto explain why the periods of all the binaries discovered by this survey are\nsmaller than 3 days. In this paper we assess the status of knowledge of binary\ncentral stars discovered because of irradiation effects. We determine that, for\naverage parameters, this technique should be biased against periods longer than\n1-2 weeks, so it is surprising that no binaries were found with periods longer\nthan 3 days. Even more puzzling is the fact that 9 out of 12 of the irradiated\nbinaries, have periods smaller than one day, a fact that is starkly at odds\nwith post-common envelope predictions. We suggest that either all common\nenvelope models tend to overestimate post-common envelope periods or that this\nbinary survey might have suffered from additional, unquantified biases. If the\nlatter hypothesis is true, the currently-known short-period binary fraction is\nput in serious doubt. We also introduce a new survey for binary-related\nvariability, which will enable us to better quantify biases and determine an\nindependent value for the short period binary fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2008 17:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The source is solar wind ions that have received an electron from\nanother atom. The presence of this alternate explanation for locally produced\ndiffuse X-rays calls into question the existence and character of the Local\nBubble. This article addresses these questions. It reviews the literature on\nsolar wind charge exchange (SWCX) X-ray production, finding that SWCX accounts\nfor roughly half of the observed local 1/4 keV X-rays found at low latitudes.\nThis article also makes predictions for the heliospheric O VI column density\nand intensity, finding them to be smaller than the observational error bars.\nEvidence for the continued belief that the Local Bubble contains hot gas\nincludes the remaining local 1/4 keV intensity, the observed local O VI column\ndensity, and the need to fill the local region with some sort of plasma.

We showed that the system is\nrobust to dynamic disorder at bulk concentration. But if the dynamic disorder\nis quasi-static, large fluctuations of the switch response behavior may be\nobserved at low concentrations. Such fluctuation is relevant to many biological\nfunctions. It can be reduced by either increasing the conformation\ninterconversion rate of the protein, or correlating the enzymatic reaction\nrates in the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2008 18:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In our model, galaxy luminosity is determined only as a function of\ndark matter halo mass. With this simple assumption, we demonstrate that large,\nempty voids of ~15 Mpc/h in diameter are expected even for galaxies seven\nmagnitudes fainter than L*. The predictions of our model are in excellent\nagreement with several statistical measures; (i) the luminosity function of\ngalaxies in underdense regions, (ii) nearest neighbor statistics of dwarf\ngalaxies, (iii) the void probability function of faint galaxies. In the\ntransition between filaments and voids in the dark matter, the halo mass\nfunction changes abruptly, causing the maximum galaxy luminosity to decrease by\n~5 magnitudes over a range of ~1 Mpc/h. Thus the boundary between filaments and\nvoids in the galaxy distribution is nearly as sharp for dwarfs as for ~L*\nobjects. These results support a picture in which galaxy formation is driven\npredominantly by the mass of the host dark matter halo, and is nearly\nindependent of the larger-scale halo environment. Further, they demonstrate\nthat LCDM, combined with a straightforward bias model, naturally explains the\nexistence of the void phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2008 14:24:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2008 22:54:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Using our\ndetailed radiation hydrodynamical models that include dust formation, we\nillustrate the effects of pulsation energy on wind properties. We find that the\nmass-loss rate scales with the kinetic energy input by pulsations as long as a\ndust-saturated wind does not occur, and all other stellar parameters are kept\nconstant. This includes the absolute abundance of condensible carbon (not bound\nin CO), which is more relevant than keeping the C/O-ratio constant when\ncomparing stars of different metallicity. The pressure and temperature\ngradients in the atmospheres of stars, become steeper and flatter,\nrespectively, when the metallicity is reduced, while the radius where the\natmosphere becomes opaque is typically associated with a higher gas pressure.\nThis effect can be compensated for by adjusting the velocity amplitude of the\nvariable inner boundary (piston), which is used to simulate the effects of\npulsation, to obtain models with comparable kinetic-energy input. Hence, it is\nmore relevant to compare models with similar energy-injections than of similar\nvelocity amplitude. Since there is no evidence for weaker pulsations in\nlow-metallicity AGB stars, we conclude that it is unlikely that low-metallicity\nC-stars have a lower mass-loss rate, than their more metal-rich counterparts\nwith similar stellar parameters, as long as they have a comparable amount of\ncondensible carbon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2008 20:12:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2008 14:32:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2008 11:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}

However, most of the fundamental issues for\nshock reflection have not been understood. Therefore, it is important to\nestablish the regularity of solutions to shock reflection in order to\nunderstand fully the phenomena of shock reflection. On the other hand, for a\nregular reflection configuration, the potential flow governs the exact behavior\nof the solution in $C^{1,1}$ across the pseudo-sonic circle even starting from\nthe full Euler flow, that is, both of the nonlinear systems are actually the\nsame in an physically significant region near the pseudo-sonic circle; thus, it\nbecomes essential to understand the optimal regularity of solutions for the\npotential flow across the pseudo-sonic circle and at the point where the\npseudo-sonic circle meets the reflected shock. In this paper, we study the\nregularity of solutions to regular shock reflection for potential flow. In\nparticular, we prove that the $C^{1,1}$-regularity is optimal for the solution\nacross the pseudo-sonic circle and at the point where the pseudo-sonic circle\nmeets the reflected shock. We also obtain the $C^{2,\\alpha}$ regularity of the\nsolution up to the pseudo-sonic circle in the pseudo-subsonic region. The\nproblem involves two types of transonic flow: one is a continuous transition\nthrough the pseudo-sonic circle from the pseudo-supersonic region to the\npseudo-subsonic region; the other a jump transition through the transonic shock\nas a free boundary from another pseudo-supersonic region to the pseudo-subsonic\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2008 23:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The system is considered a prime\ncandidate to evolve into an SNIa. We present a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of\nthe quiescent accretion and the subsequent explosive phase. The computed\ncircumstellar mass distribution in the quiescent phase is highly structured\nwith a mass enhancement in the orbital plane of about a factor of 2 as compared\nto the poleward directions. The simulated nova remnant evolves aspherically,\npropagating faster toward the poles. The shock velocities derived from the\nsimulations are in agreement with those derived from observations. For v_RG =\n20 km/s and for nearly isothermal flows, we derive a mass transfer rate to the\nWD of 10% of the mass loss of the RG. For an RG mass loss of 10^{-7} solar\nmasses per year, we found the orbit of the system to decay by 3% per million\nyears. With the derived mass transfer rate, multi-cycle nova models provide a\nqualitatively correct recurrence time, amplitude, and fastness of the nova. Our\nsimulations provide, along with the observations and nova models, the third\ningredient for a deeper understanding of the recurrent novae of the RS Oph\ntype. In combination with recent multi-cycle nova models, our results suggests\nthat the WD in RS Oph will increase in mass. Several speculative outcomes then\nseem plausible. The WD may reach the Chandrasekhar limit and explode as an SN\nIa. Alternatively, the mass loss of the RG could result in a smaller Roche\nvolume, a common envelope phase, and a narrow WD+WD system. Angular momentum\nloss due to graviational wave emission could trigger the merger of the two WDs\nand - perhaps - an SN Ia via the double degenerate scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2008 15:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
