In a Population III binary system, a more massive\nstar can result in the formation of a BH and a surrounding accretion disc. Such\nBH accretion could be a significant source of the cosmic reionization in the\nearly universe. However, a less massive companion star evolves belatedly and\neventually undergoes a SN explosion, so that the accretion disc around a BH\nmight be blown off in a lifetime of companion star. In this paper, we explore\nthe dynamical impact of a SN explosion on an accretion disc around a massive\nBH, and elucidate whether the BH accretion disc is totally demolished or not.\nFor the purpose, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a\nvery massive binary system, where we assume a BH of $10^3 M_{\\odot}$ that\nresults from a direct collapse of a very massive star and a companion star of\n$100 M_{\\odot}$ that undergoes a SN explosion. We calculate the remaining mass\nof a BH accretion disc as a function of time. As a result, it is found that a\nsignificant portion of gas disc can survive through three-dimensional\ngeometrical effects even after the SN explosion of a companion star. Even if\nthe SN explosion energy is higher by two orders of magnitude than the binding\nenergy of gas disc, about a half of disc can be left over. The results imply\nthat the Population III BH accretion disc can be a long-lived luminous source,\nand therefore could be an important ionizing source in the early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2008 18:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Many empirical evidences suggest that multiple heads\naugment the expressive power of the language, however no formal result in this\ndirection has been proved, so far.\n  In the first part of this paper we analyze the Turing completeness of CHR\nwith respect to the underneath constraint theory. We prove that if the\nconstraint theory is powerful enough then restricting to single head rules does\nnot affect the Turing completeness of the language. On the other hand,\ndifferently from the case of the multi-headed language, the single head CHR\nlanguage is not Turing powerful when the underlying signature (for the\nconstraint theory) does not contain function symbols.\n  In the second part we prove that, no matter which constraint theory is\nconsidered, under some reasonable assumptions it is not possible to encode the\nCHR language (with multi-headed rules) into a single headed language while\npreserving the semantics of the programs. We also show that, under some\nstronger assumptions, considering an increasing number of atoms in the head of\na rule augments the expressive power of the language.\n  These results provide a formal proof for the claim that multiple heads\naugment the expressive power of the CHR language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2008 16:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 19:49:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2009 16:29:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2010 18:22:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 21:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 11:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-19"}

Traditional epileptic diagnosis relies on tedious visual\nscreening by neurologists from lengthy EEG recording that requires the presence\nof seizure (ictal) activities. Nowadays, there are many systems helping the\nneurologists to quickly find interesting segments of the lengthy signal by\nautomatic seizure detection. However, we notice that it is very difficult, if\nnot impossible, to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure activities for\nepilepsy patients in areas lack of medical resources and trained neurologists.\nTherefore, we propose to study automated epileptic diagnosis using interictal\nEEG data that is much easier to collect than ictal data. The authors are not\naware of any report on automated EEG diagnostic system that can accurately\ndistinguish patients' interictal EEG from the EEG of normal people. The\nresearch presented in this paper, therefore, aims to develop an automated\ndiagnostic system that can use interictal EEG data to diagnose whether the\nperson is epileptic. Such a system should also detect seizure activities for\nfurther investigation by doctors and potential patient monitoring.

In\nstudying the radial transport of matter within protoplanetary disks by\nnumerical model calculations it is essential to resolve the vertical disk\nstructure since matter is mixed radially inward and outward by a complex\n2-dimensional flow pattern that is superposed on the global inward directed\naccretion flow. A numerical model calculation for a protoplanetary accretion\ndisks with radial and vertical mixing is performed in the 1+1-dimensional\napproximation. The global 2D velocity field of the disk is calculated from an\nanalytical solution for the meridional flow pattern, that exhibits an inward\ndrift in the upper layers and an outward drift in the midplane in most parts of\nthe disk. The disk model is based on the $\\beta$-prescription of viscosity and\nconsiders vertical self-gravitation of the disk.

The validity of such an assumption and therefore of the\nSCBA is difficult to establish with certainty.

We derive an exact analytic formula relating the full\ncounting statistic (FCS) generating function to the self-energy of the system\nin the presence of a measuring field. We first check that our approach\nreproduces correctly known results in simple limits, like the FCS of the\nresonant level system (AIM without Coulomb interaction). We then proceed to\nstudy the FCS for the AIM perturbatively in the Coulomb interaction. By\ncomparing this perturbative analysis with a strong coupling expansion, we\narrive at a conjecture for an expression for the FCS generating function at\nO(V^3) (V is the voltage across the impurity) valid at all orders in the\ninteraction.\n  In the second part of the article, we examine a Bethe ansatz analysis of the\ncurrent noise for the AIM. Unlike the Fermi liquid approach, here the goal is\nto obtain qualitative, not quantitative, results for a wider range of voltages\nboth in and out of a magnetic field. Particularly notable are finite field\nresults showing a double peaked structure in the current noise for voltages\nsatisfying eV ~ mu H$.

Aims: We show that when using the standard equations for magnetic\ndipole radiation with recent soft gamma-ray observations leads to deriving an\nextreme set of parameters (magnetic field, period and spin down rate) for the\nputative pulsar. Alternative scenarios that generate more typical parameter\nvalues are explored. Methods: The properties of the putative pulsar are\ncalculated assuming that the 20-100 keV luminosity corresponds to 1% of Edot,\nthat the source is 4.5 kpc away, and that the pulsar age is 300 yrs. This gives\nP = 0.55 s, Pdot = 3E-11 s/s, and B = 1.28E14 G. This is a very extreme set\ncompared to the population of known pulsars in PWN systems. Using the equations\nfor magnetic dipole losses makes it possible to adjust the initial assumptions\nto see what is required for a more reasonable set of pulsar parameters.\nResults: The current measured properties for IGR J18135-1751/HESS J1813-178\n(i.e. luminosity, distance, and age) result in extreme properties of the unseen\npulsar within the PWN. The simplest method for achieving more reasonable\nproperties for the pulsar is to decouple the spin-down age of the pulsar from\nthe actual age for the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2008 22:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The stability of the GC is studied for both the\ncase of perfectly cooperating transmitters (transferrable) and under a partial\ndecode-and-forward strategy (non-transferable).

In it, collapse occurs because particles interact with a\nclassical random field. However, particles gain energy from this field, i.e.,\nparticle energy is not conserved. Recently, it has been shown how to construct\na theory dubbed \"completely quantized collapse\" (CQC) which is predictively\nequivalent to CSL. In CQC, a quantized random field is introduced, and CSL's\nclassical random field becomes its eigenvalue. In CQC, energy is conserved,\nwhich allows one to understand that energy is conserved in CSL, as the\nparticle's energy gain is compensated by the random field's energy loss. Since\nthe random field has energy, it should have gravitational consequences. For\nthat, one needs to know the random field's energy density. In this paper, it is\nshown how to construct a symmetric, conserved, energy-momentum-stress-density\ntensor associated with the quantized random field, even though this field obeys\nno dynamical equation and has no Lagrangian.

In our system, we consider a\nquasi-static fading environment and we incorporate both high-rate and low-rate\nfeedback channels with possible feedback errors. To utilize feedback\ninformation, a class of code constellations is proposed, inspired from\northogonal designs and precoded space-time block codes, which is called\ngeneralized partly orthogonal designs or generalized PODs. Furthermore, to\nmodel feedback errors, we assume that the feedback bits go through binary\nsymmetric channels (BSCs). Two cases are studied: first, when the BSC bit error\nprobability is known a priori to the transmission ends and second, when it is\nnot known exactly. In the first case, we derive a minimum pairwise error\nprobability (PEP) design criterion for generalized PODs. Then we design the\nquantizer for the erroneous feedback channel and the precoder codebook of PODs\nbased on this criterion. The quantization scheme in our system is a channel\noptimized vector quantizer (COVQ). In the second case, the design of the\nquantizer and the precoder codebook is based on similar approaches, however\nwith a worst-case design strategy. The attractive property of our combining\nscheme is that it converges to conventional space-time coding with low-rate and\nerroneous feedback and to directional beamforming with high-rate and error-free\nfeedback.

We consider\ntwo types of distortion for reconstruction: support errors and mean-squared\nerrors. Our goal is to relate the number of measurements, $m$, and $\\snr$, to\nsignal sparsity, $k$, distortion level, $d$, and signal dimension, $n$. We\nconsider support errors in a worst-case setting. We employ different variations\nof Fano's inequality to derive necessary conditions on the number of\nmeasurements and $\\snr$ required for exact reconstruction. To derive sufficient\nconditions we develop new insights on max-likelihood analysis based on a novel\nsuperposition property. In particular this property implies that small support\nerrors are the dominant error events. Consequently, our ML analysis does not\nsuffer the conservatism of the union bound and leads to a tighter analysis of\nmax-likelihood. These results provide order-wise tight bounds. For output noise\nmodels we show that asymptotically an $\\snr$ of $\\Theta(\\log(n))$ together with\n$\\Theta(k \\log(n/k))$ measurements is necessary and sufficient for exact\nsupport recovery. Furthermore, if a small fraction of support errors can be\ntolerated, a constant $\\snr$ turns out to be sufficient in the linear sparsity\nregime. In contrast for input noise models we show that support recovery fails\nif the number of measurements scales as $o(n\\log(n)/SNR)$ implying poor\ncompression performance for such cases. We also consider Bayesian set-up and\ncharacterize tradeoffs between mean-squared distortion and the number of\nmeasurements using rate-distortion theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2008 03:25:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 20:14:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 14:57:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 16:39:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 18:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-22"}

Time-average and pulse-phase spectroscopy were\nemployed to study the spectral variability in the flare and out-of-flare states\nand energy variations with pulse phase. Power spectra were obtained to\ninvestigate the periodic and aperiodic variability. Two large flares, with a\nduration of ~450 seconds were observed on 24 and 25 December 2005.

Aims: Previous observations with the VLT/VISIR\ninstrument (Kervella & Domiciano de Souza 2007) revealed a faint companion to\nAchernar, the brightest Be star in the sky. The present observations are\nintended to characterize the physical nature of this object. Methods: We\nobtained near-IR images and an H-band spectrum of Achernar B using the VLT/NACO\nadaptive optics systems. Results: Our images clearly show the displacement of\nAchernar B over a portion of its orbit around Achernar A.

The projected angular separation of the two objects in December\n2007 was smaller than 0.15 arcsec, or 6.7 AU at the distance of Achernar.\nConclusions: From its flux distribution in the near- and thermal-IR, Achernar B\nis most likely an A1V-A3V star. Its orbital period appears similar to the\nobserved pseudo-periodicity of the Be phenomenon of Achernar. This indicates\nthat an interaction between A and B at periastron could be the trigger of the\nBe episodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2008 08:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The simplest explanation is that each cluster is composed of at\nleast two different stellar populations with very similar metal abundances but\nages separated by up to ~300 Myr. The origin of these unusual properties\nremains unidentified; however, the fact that at least three massive clusters\ncontaining multiple stellar populations are now known in the LMC suggests a\npotentially significant formation channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2008 09:02:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 May 2008 08:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The maximum stable throughput is derived and demonstrated via examples\nof geometric retransmission (K=1) and exponential backoff (K=infinity). For\nnetworks with an infinite number of nodes, we show that geometric\nretransmission is unstable, and the stable network throughput of exponential\nbackoff can only be achieved at the cost of potential unbounded delay in each\ninput queue. Furthermore, we address the stability issue of the systems at the\nundesired stable point.

The natural pseudo-distance is a dissimilarity measure between\nshapes, where a shape is viewed as a topological space endowed with a\nreal-valued continuous function. Measuring dissimilarity amounts to minimizing\nthe change in the functions due to the application of homeomorphisms between\ntopological spaces, with respect to the $L_\\infty$-norm. In order to obtain the\nlower bound, a suitable metric between size functions, called matching\ndistance, is introduced. It compares size functions by solving an optimal\nmatching problem between countable point sets. The matching distance is shown\nto be resistant to perturbations, implying that it is always smaller than the\nnatural pseudo-distance. We also prove that the lower bound so obtained is\nsharp and cannot be improved by any other distance between size functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2008 11:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-23"}

Correcting their observed VHE spectrum for gamma-gamma absorption even\nby the lowest plausible level of the IIBR provided evidence for a very hard\n(photon spectral index Gamma_{ph} < 2) intrinsic source spectrum out to TeV\nenergies.

We presume the nebula to be weakly turbulent, which\nleads to dense concentrations of aerodynamically size-sorted particles having\nproperties like those observed in chondrites. The fractional volume of the\nnebula occupied by these dense zones or clumps obeys a probability distribution\nas a function of their density, and the densest concentrations have particle\nmass density 100 times that of the gas. However, even these densest clumps are\nprevented by gas pressure from undergoing gravitational instability in the\ntraditional sense (on a dynamical timescale). While in this state of arrested\ndevelopment, they are susceptible to disruption by the ram pressure of the\ndifferentially orbiting nebula gas. However, self-gravity can preserve\nsufficiently large and dense clumps from ram pressure disruption, allowing\ntheir entrained particles to sediment gently but inexorably towards their\ncenters, producing 10-100 km \"sandpile\" planetesimals.

Detecting regular dips in the light curve of a star is an easy way\nto detect the presence of an orbiting planet. COROT is a Franco-European\nmission launched at the end of 2006, and one of its main objectives is to\ndetect planetary systems using the transit method. Aims. In this paper, we\npresent a new method for transit detection and determine the smallest detected\nplanetary radius, assuming a parent star like the Sun. Methods. We simulated\nlight curves with Poisson noise and stellar variability, for which data from\nthe VIRGO/PMO6 instrument on board SoHO were used. Transits were simulated\nusing the UTM software. Light curves were denoised by the mean of a low-pass\nand a high-pass filter. The detection of periodic transits works on light\ncurves folded at several trial periods with the particularity that no rebinning\nis performed after the folding. The best fit was obtain when all transits are\noverlayed, i.e when the data are folded at the right period. Results. Assuming\na single data set lasting 150d, transits from a planet with a radius down to 2\nRearth can be detected. The efficiency depends neither on the transit duration\nnor on the number of transits observed. Furthermore we simulated transits with\nperiods close to 150d in data sets containing three observations of 150d,\nseparated by regular gaps with the same length. Again, planets with a radius\ndown to 2 Rearth can be detected. Conclusions. Within the given range of\nparameters, the detection efficiency depends slightly on the apparent magnitude\nof the star but neither on the transit duration nor the number of transits.\nFurthermore, multiple observations might represent a solution for the COROT\nmission for detecting small planets when the orbital period is much longer than\nthe duration of a single observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2008 14:32:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2008 12:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A time-dependent analysis of the closed-loop system enables us to\nidentify the different contributions to the medium response. A comparison with\nthe reference system then allows one to identify the physical mechanism that\nleads to the enhancement.

The examination of\nthe L\\'evy ratchet has to be based on the characteristics of directionality\nwhich are different from typically used measures like mean current and the\ndispersion of particles' positions, since these get inappropriate when the\nmoments of the noise diverge. To overcome this problem, we discuss robust\nmeasures of directionality of transport like the position of the median of the\nparticles displacements' distribution characterizing the group velocity, and\nthe interquantile distance giving the measure of the distributions' width.\nMoreover, we analyze the behavior of splitting probabilities for leaving an\ninterval of a given length unveiling qualitative differences between the noises\nwith L\\'evy indices below and above unity. Finally, we inspect the problem of\nthe first escape from an interval of given length revealing independence of\nexit times on the structure of the potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2008 15:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We show with the\nPolyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that such a type of\ncoexistence is realized in the imaginary chemical potential region of the QCD\nphase diagram.
