These include photometric and astrometric\nmeasurements from Hubble Space Telescope, as well as constraints from higher\norder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlens\nparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. Our primary\nanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of Jovian planet\nOGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb is an M dwarf in the foreground disk with mass M= 0.46 +/-\n0.04 Msun, distance D_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_LSR ~\n103 km/s. From the best-fit model, the planet has mass M_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 M_Jup,\nlies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 AU from its host and so has\nan equilibrium temperature of T ~ 55 K, i.e., similar to Neptune. A degenerate\nmodel less favored by \\Delta\\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of the\nimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass M_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 M_Jup with a\nsmaller projected separation, r_\\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 AU, and higher equilibrium\ntemperature T ~ 71 K. These results from the primary analysis suggest that\nOGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered that\nis hosted by an M dwarf. However, the formation of such high-mass planetary\ncompanions in the outer regions of M-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to be\nunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. There are a number of caveats to\nthis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) that\nthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, that\nis, the planetary host. However, these caveats could mostly be resolved by a\nsingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2008 19:29:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2009 02:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

A test of the selection using 1121 stars of the HK survey of\nBeers, Preston, and Shectman present on HES plates suggests that the\ncompleteness at [Fe/H] < -3.5 is close to 100% and that, at the same time, the\ncontamination of the candidate sample with false positives is low: 50% of all\nstars with [Fe/H] > -2.5 and 97% of all stars with [Fe/H] > -2.0 are rejected.\nThe selection was applied to 379 HES fields, covering a nominal area of 8853\nsquare degrees of the southern high Galactic latitude sky. The candidate sample\nconsists of 20,271 stars in the magnitude range 10 < B < 18. A comparison of\nthe magnitude distribution with that of the HK survey shows that the magnitude\nlimit of the HES sample is about 2 mag fainter. Taking the overlap of the sky\nareas covered by both surveys into account, it follows that the survey volume\nfor metal-poor stars has been increased by the HES by about a factor of 10 with\nrespect to the HK survey. We have already identified several very rare objects\nwith the HES, including, e.g., the three most heavy-element deficient stars\ncurrently known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2008 16:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We propose a\nscheme for classifying the morphology of clusters based on their surface\nbrightness and entropy profiles. Three dominant morphologies emerge: two\nhosting compact cores and central temperatures which are cool (CCC systems) or\nwarm (CWC systems) and one hosting extended cores which are warm (EWC systems).\nWe find that CCC states are disrupted only after direct collisions between\ncluster cores in head-on collisions or during second pericentric passage in\noff-axis mergers. By the time they relax, our remnant cores have generally been\nheated to warm core (CWC or EWC) states but subsequently recover CCC states.\nThe only case resulting in a long-lived EWC state is a slightly off-axis 3:1\nmerger for which the majority of shock heating occurs during the accretion of a\nlow-entropy stream formed from the disruption of the secondary's core.\nCompression prevents core temperatures from falling until after relaxation thus\nexplaining the observed population of relaxed CWC systems with no need to\ninvoke AGN feedback. The morphological segregation observed in the L_x-T_x and\nbeta-r_c scaling relations is reflected in our simulations as well. However,\nnone of the cases we have studied produce sufficiently high remnant central\nentropies to account for the most under-luminous EWC systems observed. Lastly,\nsystems which initially host central metallicity gradients do not yield merger\nremnants with flat metallicity profiles. Taken together, these results suggest\nthat once formed, compact core systems are remarkably stable against disruption\nfrom mergers. It remains to be demonstrated exactly how the sizable observed\npopulation of extended core systems was formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2008 20:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

If elementary scalar fields play a role in the fundamental\ntheory (such as Higgs fields in the Standard Model coupled to gravity), then\ntheir shadows in d dimensions must necessarily be conformal scalars. This has\nthe physical consequence that the gravitational constant changes at each phase\ntransition (inflation, grand unification, electro-weak, etc.), implying\ninteresting new scenarios in cosmological applications. The fundamental action\nfor pure gravity, which includes the spacetime metric, the dilaton and an\nadditional auxiliary scalar field all in d+2 dimensions with two times, has a\nmix of gauge symmetries to produce appropriate constraints that remove all\nghosts or redundant degrees of freedom. The action produces on-shell classical\nfield equations of motion in d+2 dimensions, with enough constraints for the\ntheory to be in agreement with classical General Relativity in d dimensions.\nTherefore this action describes the correct classical gravitational physics\ndirectly in d+2 dimensions.

More than ten years ago,\nwe proposed a new fundamental equation of nonequilibrium statistical physics in\nplace of the present Liouville equation. That is the stochastic velocity type's\nLangevin equation in 6N dimensional phase space or its equivalent Liouville\ndiffusion equation. This equation is time-reversed asymmetrical. It shows that\nthe form of motion of particles in statistical thermodynamic systems has the\ndrift-diffusion duality, and the law of motion of statistical thermodynamics is\nexpressed by a superposition of both the law of dynamics and stochastic\nvelocity and possesses both determinism and probability. Hence it is different\nwith the law of motion of particles in dynamical systems. Starting from this\nfundamental equation the BBGKY diffusion equation hierarchy, the Boltzmann\ncollision diffusion equation, the hydrodynamic equations such as the mass\ndrift-diffusion equation, the Navier-Stokes equation and the thermal\nconductivity equation have been derived and presented here. What is more\nimportant, we first constructed a nonlinear evolution equation of\nnonequilibrium entropy density in 6N, 6 and 3 dimensional phase space,\npredicted the existence of entropy diffusion. This evolution equation reveals\nthat the time rate of change of nonequilibrium entropy density originates\ntogether from its drift, diffusion and production in space. Furthermore, we\npresented a formula for entropy production rate (i.e. the law of entropy\nincrease), proved that internal attractive force in nonequilibrium system can\nresult in entropy decrease while internal repulsive force leads to another\nentropy increase, obtained an unified theoretical expression for thermodynamic\ndegradation and self-organizing evolution, and revealed that the entropy\ndiffusion mechanism caused the system to approach to equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 03:12:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2009 12:28:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 16:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2011 10:14:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 15:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

In the low state, instead of eclipse ingress and egress, the\nlightcurve shows a smooth flux variation with orbital phase. The orbital\nmodulation of the X-ray lightcurve in the low state shows that the X-ray\nemission observed in this state is from an extended object.

As a result, observational identification of the systems in\nwhich this neutral hydrogen resides is an important missing ingredient in\nmodels of galaxy formation. Precise identification of DLA host mass via\ntraditional clustering studies is not practical owing to the small numbers of\nknown systems being spread across sparsely distributed sight lines. However\nfollowing the completion of reionization, 21cm surface brightness fluctuations\nwill be dominated by neutral hydrogen in DLAs.

We show that measurement of the spherically averaged\npower-spectrum of 21cm intensity fluctuations due to DLAs could be used to\nmeasure the galaxy bias for DLA host galaxies when combined with an independent\nmeasurement of the cosmological HI mass density from quasar absorption studies.\nUtilising this technique, the low frequency arrays now under construction could\nmeasure the characteristic DLA host mass with a statistical precision as low as\n0.3 dex at z~4. In addition, high signal-to-noise observations of the\npeculiar-motion induced anisotropy of the power-spectrum would facilitate\nmeasurement of both the DLA host mass and the cosmic HI density directly from\n21cm fluctuations. By exploiting this anisotropy, a second generation of low\nfrequency arrays with an order of magnitude increase in collecting area could\nmeasure the values of cosmic HI density and DLA host mass, with uncertainties\nof a few percent and a few tens of percent respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 06:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

These counter-intuitive surprising findings constitute\nemergent properties of self-organized natural roads, which are intelligent\nenough for predicting traffic flow, thus shedding substantial insights into the\nunderstanding of road networks and their traffic from the perspective of\ncomplex networks.\n  Keywords: topological analysis, traffic flow, phase transition, small world,\nscale free, tipping point\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 07:04:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 May 2008 16:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Jul 2008 07:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-14"}

It is found\nthat the possible region for the electroweak vacuum to exist is quite limited,\ndepending on the parameters in the model. The masses and couplings of the Higgs\nbosons are calculated with/without CP violation. Even at the tree level, CP\nviolation is possible by complex soft SUSY breaking masses. Similar to the CPX\nscenario in the MSSM, the scalar-pseudoscalar mixing enables the lightest Higgs\nboson mass to become smaller than the $Z$ boson mass while the coupling with\nthe $Z$ boson is sufficiently suppressed to avoid the LEP experimental\nconstraints. However, unlike the CPX scenario, large $\\mu$ and $A$ are not\nrequired for the realization of large CP violation. The typical spectrum of the\nSUSY particles is thus different.

A user learns about the instantaneous state of\nan available channel by transmitting a control packet in it. Since probing all\nchannels consumes significant energy and time, a user needs to determine what\nand how much information it needs to acquire about the instantaneous states of\nthe available channels so that it can maximize its transmission rate. This\nmotivates the study of the trade-off between the cost of information\nacquisition and its value towards improving the transmission rate.\n  A simple model is presented for studying this information acquisition and\nexploitation trade-off when the channels are multi-state, with different\ndistributions and information acquisition costs. The objective is to maximize a\nutility function which depends on both the cost and value of information.\nSolution techniques are presented for computing near-optimal policies with\nsuccinct representation in polynomial time. These policies provably achieve at\nleast a fixed constant factor of the optimal utility on any problem instance,\nand in addition, have natural characterizations. The techniques are based on\nexploiting the structure of the optimal policy, and use of Lagrangean\nrelaxations which simplify the space of approximately optimal solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 14:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-11"}

The X-ray afterglow, observed\nfrom 26 min to 20 days after the burst, shows a simple power-law decay with\nalpha_X=1.290 \\pm 0.008. Optical observations presented here cover the time\nrange from 258 s (Faulkes Telescope North) to 15 days (Gemini North) after the\nburst; the decay rate of the optical afterglow shows a steep-to-shallow\ntransition (from alpha_1=1.48 \\pm 0.06 to alpha_2=0.88 \\pm 0.03) approximately\n13 min after the burst.

In studying the\nbounded Hochschild cohomology groups H^1(A,X) it is often useful to extend a\ngiven derivation D: A-> X to a Banach algebra B containing A as an ideal,\nthereby exploiting (or establishing) hereditary properties. This is usually\ndone using (bounded/unbounded) approximate identities to obtain the extension\nas a limit of operators b->D(ba)-b.D(a), (a in A) in an appropriate operator\ntopology, the main point in the proof being to show that the limit map is in\nfact a derivation. In this paper we make clear which part of this approach is\nanalytic and which algebraic by presenting an algebraic scheme that gives\nderivations in all situations at the cost of enlarging the module. We use our\nconstruction to give improvements and shorter proofs of some results from the\nliterature and to give a necessary and sufficient condition that biprojectivity\nand biflatness are inherited to ideals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 15:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-11"}

We find that the non-WKB effects\nare significant, for the fast and slow solar wind solutions alike. Compared\nwith their non-WKB counterparts the WKB ones are more effective in accelerating\nthe solar wind inside the Alfv\\'en point, producing significantly enhanced ion\nfluxes and considerably reduced alpha abundance in the inner corona. Only when\n$\\omega \\gtrsim 3.5\\times 10^{-3}$ ($1.5\\times 10^{-3}$) $\\rm rad s^{-1}$ can\nthe fast (slow) wind models be adequately approximated by the WKB one.\nMoreover, while the Alfv\\'en waves tend to reduce the magnitude of the\nproton-alpha speed difference $|U_{\\alpha p}|$ in general, different mechanisms\noperate in two different regimes separated by an $\\omega_c\\sim {several}\\times\n10^{-5}$ $\\rm rad s^{-1}$. When $\\omega > \\omega_c$, the fluctuations are\nwave-like and tend to accelerate both ion species, thereby losing most of their\nenergy by doing work on ion flows; whereas when $\\omega < \\omega_c$, a\nquasi-static behavior results: the fluctuations may act to accelerate the\nslower flowing ion species but decelerate the faster moving one in a large\nportion of the computational domain, and only a minor fraction of the wave\nenergy flux injected at the base is lost. The consequences of $\\omega_c$ on the\nvelocity fluctuation spectra of protons and alpha particles, which are likely\nto be obtained by future missions like Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe, are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 15:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For all three systems it is found that the PDFs of inertial range\nenergy fluctuations exhibit self-similarity and monoscaling in agreement with\nrecent solar-wind measurements [B. Hnat et al., Geophys. Res. Lett. 29(10),\n86-1 (2002)]. Furthermore, the energy PDFs exhibit similarity over all scales\nof the turbulent system showing no substantial qualitative change of shape as\nthe scale of the fluctuations varies.
