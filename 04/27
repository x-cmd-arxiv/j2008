Through judicious\ndistinction between the referential and local descriptions, the principle of\nmaterial invariance is established and shown to be a true covariance principle,\nunlike the Lorentz covariance, which is valid only for non-deforming frames in\nrectilinear relative motion. Thus, this paper establishes that electrodynamics\ncan be fully explained if one assumes that it is the manifestation of the\ninternal forces of an underlying elastic material which we term the\nmetacontinuum.\n  The new frame-indifferent formulation of electrodynamics is shown to\nincorporate the Lorentz force as an integral part of Faraday's law, rather than\nas an additional empirical variable. Respectively, if the upper-convected\nderivative is added in Maxwell's displacement current it can explain\nBiot-Savart's and Oersted-Ampere's laws. An immediate corollary of the material\ninvariance is the Galilean invariance of the model.\n  The possible detection of the absolute continuum is also discussed. First,\nthe famous experiment of Ives and Stilwell is reexamined with a modified\nBohr-Rydberg formula for the emitted frequencies from a moving atom, and it is\nshown that the results are fully compatible with the presence of an absolute\nmedium. Second, a new interferometry experiment is proposed in which the\nfirst-order Doppler effect can be measured, and thus the presence of a medium\nat rest can be unequivocally established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Apr 2008 20:56:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2009 06:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2009 21:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-11"}

This radio structure is similar to that detected\nin bright Seyferts galaxies like NGC 7469 or Mrk 331, which display clear\ncircumnuclear rings. While the compact, centrally located radio emission in\nthese starbursts might be generated by a point-like source (AGN), or by the\ncombined effect of multiple radio supernovae and supernova remnants (e.g., the\nevolved nuclear starburst in Arp~220), it seems well established that the\ncircumnuclear regions of those objects host an ongoing burst of star-formation\n(e.g., NGC 7469; Colina et al. 2001, Alberdi et al. 2006). Therefore,\nhigh-resolution radio observations of Luminous Infra-Red Galaxies (LIRGs) in\nour local universe are a powerful tool to probe the dominant dust heating\nmechanism in their nuclear and circumnuclear regions.\n  In this contribution, we show results obtained from VLA-A, MERLIN, and EVN\n(VLBI) radio observations of the galaxies NGC 7469 (D~70 Mpc) and IRAS\n18293-3413 (D ~ 79 Mpc), where two extremely bright radio supernovae have been\nfound.
