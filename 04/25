For this purpose, we study the low energy theory including g_s\ncorrections to the gaugino condensate superpotential that stabilizes the K3\nvolume modulus. The gauge kinetic function is verified to become holomorphic\nwhen the original N=2 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to N=1 by bulk\nfluxes. From the underlying classical N=2 supergravity, the theory inherits a\nshift symmetry which provides the inflaton with a naturally flat potential. We\nanalyze the fate of this shift symmetry after the inclusion of quantum\ncorrections. The field range of the inflaton is found to depend significantly\non the complex structure of the torus but is independent of its volume. This\nallows for a large kinematical field range for the inflaton.

Sela introduced the idea of JSJ-decompositions for\ngroups, an idea that has flourished in a variety of directions. The general\nidea is to consider a certain class X of groups and splittings of groups in X\nby groups in another class Y. E.g. Rips and Sela considered splittings of\nfinitely presented groups by infinite cyclic groups. For an arbitrary group G\nin X the goal is to produce a unique graph of groups decomposition T of G with\nedge groups in Y so that T reveals all graph of groups decompositions of G with\nedge groups in Y. More specifically, if V is a vertex group of T then either\nthere is no Y-group that splits both G and V, or V has a special \"surface\ngroup-like\" structure. It is standard to call vertex groups of the second type\n\"orbifold groups\". For a finitely generated Coxeter system (W,S) we produce a\nreduced JSJ-decomposition T for splittings of W over virtually abelian\nsubgroups. We show T is unique with each vertex and edge group generated by a\nsubset of S (and so T is \"visual\"). The construction of T is algorithmic. If V,\na subset of S, generates an orbifold vertex group of T then V is the disjoint\nunion of K and M, where < M > is virtually abelian, < K > is virtually a closed\nsurface group or virtually free and < V > is the direct product of < M > and <\nK >.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2008 16:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 18:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-16"}

Conventionally, it has\nbecome a standard technique to produce the nonclassical light through the\nnonlinear optical processes occurring in nonlinear crystals. In this review we\ndescribe using cold atomic-gas media to generate such nonclassical light,\nespecially focusing on narrow-band biphoton generation. Compared with the\nstandard procedure, the new biphoton source has such properties as long\ncoherence time, long coherence length, high spectral brightness, and high\nconversion efficiency. In this paper we concentrate on the theoretical aspect\nof the entangled two-photon state produced from the four-wave mixing in a\nmultilevel atomic ensemble.

The superfluid order parameter,\nand fluctuations thereof, are implemented by a bosonic Hubbard-Stratonovich\nfield, which splits into two components corresponding to longitudinal and\ntransverse (Goldstone) fluctuations. Physical properties of the system are\ncomputed from a set of approximate flow equations obtained by truncating the\nexact functional renormalization group flow of the coupled fermion-boson\naction. The equations capture the influence of fluctuations on non-universal\nquantities such as the fermionic gap, as well as the universal infrared\nasymptotics present in every fermionic superfluid. We solve the flow equations\nnumerically in two dimensions and compute the asymptotic behavior analytically\nin two and three dimensions. The fermionic gap \\Delta is reduced significantly\ncompared to the mean-field gap, and the bosonic order parameter \\alpha, which\nis equivalent to \\Delta in mean-field theory, is suppressed to values below\n\\Delta by fluctuations. The fermion-boson vertex is only slightly renormalized.\nIn the infrared regime, transverse order parameter fluctuations associated with\nthe Goldstone mode lead to a strong renormalization of longitudinal\nfluctuations: the longitudinal mass and the bosonic self-interaction vanish\nlinearly as a function of the scale in two dimensions, and logarithmically in\nthree dimensions, in agreement with the exact behavior of an interacting Bose\ngas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2008 19:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-03"}

A bald patch topology\nis believed to be the essential ingredient for filament channels and is often\nfound in extrapolations of the observed photospheric field. Using an analytic\nsource-surface model to calculate the magnetic topology of a small bipolar\nregion embedded in a global magnetic dipole field, we demonstrate that although\ncommon in closed-field regions close to the solar equator, bald patches are\nunlikely to occur in the open-field topology of a coronal hole.

Most current models\nrequire feedback from supermassive black holes (AGN feedback) to quench star\nformation in galaxies in the centers of their dark matter halos (central\ngalaxies). Such models make the strong prediction that all quenched central\ngalaxies must have a large supermassive black hole (and, by association, a\nprominent bulge component).

A prime example is the Mott insulator, where the\nsuppression of conductivity is a result of interactions and not the consequence\nof a filled Bloch band. The proximity to the Mott insulating phase in fermionic\nsystems is the origin for many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter\nphysics, most notably high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore it is\nhighly desirable to use the novel experimental tools developed in atomic\nphysics to access this regime. Indeed, the Hubbard model, which encompasses the\nessential physics of the Mott insulator, also applies to quantum gases trapped\nin an optical lattice. However, the Mott insulating regime has so far been\nreached only with a gas of bosons, lacking the rich and peculiar nature of\nfermions.

However this\nincreased accuracy also places greater demands on the statistical tools used to\nextract the available information. To date, the majority of lensing analyses\nuse the two point-statistics of the cosmic shear field. These can either be\nstudied directly using the two-point correlation function, or in Fourier space,\nusing the power spectrum. But analyzing weak lensing data inevitably involves\nthe masking out of regions or example to remove bright stars from the field.\nMasking out the stars is common practice but the gaps in the data need proper\nhandling. In this paper, we show how an inpainting technique allows us to\nproperly fill in these gaps with only $N \\log N$ operations, leading to a new\nimage from which we can compute straight forwardly and with a very good\naccuracy both the pow er spectrum and the bispectrum. We propose then a new\nmethod to compute the bispectrum with a polar FFT algorithm, which has the main\nadvantage of avoiding any interpolation in the Fourier domain. Finally we\npropose a new method for dark matter mass map reconstruction from shear\nobservations which integrates this new inpainting concept.

Following this approach, I\ninvestigate the evolution of the fraction, the radial distribution, the\ndistribution of mass ratios and periods of the binary population. According to\nthese simulations, the fraction of surviving binaries appears to be dominated\nby the processes of binary ionization and evaporation. In particular, the\nfrequency of binary systems changes by a factor 1-5 depending on the initial\nconditions and on the assumed initial distribution of periods. The comparison\nwith the existing estimates of binary fractions in Galactic globular clusters\nsuggests that significant variations in the initial binary content could exist\namong the analysed globular cluster.

A homogeneous and differential analysis of the bulge, halo, thin disk\nand thick disk stars ensured that systematic errors were minimized. We confirm\nthe well-established differences for [O/Fe] (at a given metallicity) between\nthe local thin and thick disks. For the elements investigated, we find no\nchemical distinction between the bulge and the local thick disk, which is in\ncontrast to previous studies relying on literature values for disk dwarf stars\nin the solar neighborhood.

By\ncomparing the simulation results to exact analytical results for a bimolecular\nreaction, we show that the algorithm correctly reproduces both equilibrium and\ndynamical quantities. We apply our scheme to a ``push-pull'' network in which\ntwo antagonistic enzymes covalently modify a substrate. Our results highlight\nthat the diffusive behaviour of the reacting species can reduce the gain of the\nresponse curve of this network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2008 15:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
