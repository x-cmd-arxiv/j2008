In order to test this hypothesis, we study the\nrest-frame U-B color distribution of massive galaxies at 2<z<3. The sample is\ndrawn from our near-infrared spectroscopic survey for massive galaxies. The\ncolor distribution shows a statistically significant (>3 sigma) red sequence,\nwhich hosts ~60% of the stellar mass at the high-mass end. The red-sequence\ngalaxies have little or no ongoing star formation, as inferred from both\nemission-line diagnostics and stellar continuum shapes. Their strong Balmer\nbreaks and their location in the rest-frame U-B, B-V plane indicate that they\nare in a post-starburst phase, with typical ages of ~0.5-1.0 Gyr. In order to\nstudy the evolution of the red sequence, we compare our sample with\nspectroscopic massive galaxy samples at 0.02<z<0.045 and 0.6<z<1.0. The\nrest-frame U-B color reddens by ~0.25 mag from z~2.3 to the present at a given\nmass. Over the same redshift interval, the number and stellar mass density on\nthe high-mass end (>10^11 Msol) of the red sequence grow by factors of ~8 and\n~6, respectively. We explore simple models to explain the observed evolution.\nPassive evolution models predict too strong d(U-B), and produce z~0 galaxies\nthat are too red. More complicated models that include aging, galaxy\ntransformations, and red mergers can explain both the number density and color\nevolution of the massive end of the red sequence between z~2.3 and the present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 18:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The underlying idea is that,\nin order to calculate the collisional evolution of a system, some particle\ninteractions are more important than others and require more resolution, while\nthe behavior of the less important, usually of smaller mass, particles can be\nconsidered collectively. In this approximation groups of identical particles,\nsharing the same mass and structural parameters, operate as one unit. The\namount of grouping is determined by the zoom factor -- a free parameter that\ndetermines on which particles the computational effort is focused. Two methods\nfor choosing the zoom factors are discussed: the `equal mass method,' in which\nthe groups trace the mass density of the distribution, and the `distribution\nmethod,' which additionally follows fluctuations in the distribution. Both\nmethods achieve excellent correspondence with analytic solutions to the\nSmoluchowski coagulation equation. The grouping method is furthermore applied\nto simulations involving runaway kernels, where the particle interaction rate\nis a strong function of particle mass, and to situations that include\ncatastrophic fragmentation. For the runaway simulations previous predictions\nfor the decrease of the runaway timescale with the initial number of particles\n${\\cal N}$ are reconfirmed, extending ${\\cal N}$ to $10^{160}$. Astrophysical\napplications include modeling of dust coagulation, planetesimal accretion, and\nthe dynamical evolution of stars in large globular clusters. The proposed\nmethod is a powerful tool to compute the evolution of any system where the\nparticles interact through discrete events, with the particle properties\ncharacterized by structural parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 17:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Because of the continued difficulties in automating\ncertain tasks that are natural for humans, there remains a strong motivation\nfor AI researchers to investigate and apply new algorithms and techniques to\nhard AI problems.

Groups within narrow ranges of mass in the mock catalogue show\nincreasing group age with isolation and concentration. However, in the\nobservational data the stellar age, as indicated by the spectral type, only\nshows a correlation with concentration. We study groups of similar mass and\ndifferent assembly history, finding important differences in their galaxy\npopulation. Particularly, in high mass SDSS groups, the number of members,\nmass-to-light ratios, red galaxy fractions and the magnitude difference between\nthe brightest and second brightest group galaxies, show different trends as a\nfunction of isolation and concentration, even when it is expected that the\nlatter two quantities correlate with group age. Conversely, low mass SDSS\ngroups appear to be less sensitive to their assembly history. The correlations\ndetected in the SDSS are not consistent with the trends measured in the mock\ncatalogues.

The\nphantom-like behaviour is based in defining an effective energy density that\ngrows as the brane expands. This effective description breaks down at some\npoint in the past when the effective energy density becomes negative and the\neffective equation of state parameter blows up. In this paper we investigate if\nthe phantom-like regime can be enlarged by the inclusion of a Gauss-Bonnet (GB)\nterm into the bulk. The motivation is that such a GB component would model\nadditional curvature effects on the brane setting. More precisely, our aim is\nto determine if the GB term, dominating and modifying the early behaviour of\nthe brane universe, may eventually extend the regime of validity of the phantom\nmimicry on the brane. However, we show that the opposite occurs: the GB effect\nseems instead to induce a breakdown of the phantom-like behaviour at an even\nsmaller redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 20:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2008 09:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-23"}

Recent precision spin-structure data from Jefferson\nLab have significantly advanced our knowledge of nucleon structure in the\nvalence quark (high-x) region and improved our understanding of higher-twist\neffects, spin sum rules and quark-hadron duality. First, results of spin sum\nrules and polarizabilities in the low to intermediate Q^2 region are presented.\nComparison with theoretical calculations are discussed. Surprising\ndisagreements of Chiral Perturbation Theory calculations with experimental\nresults on the generalized spin polarizability, \\delta_{LT}, were found. Then,\nprecision measurements of the spin asymmetry in the high-x region are\npresented. They provide crucial input for global fits to world data to extract\npolarized parton distribution functions. The up and down quark spin\ndistributions in the nucleon were extracted. The results for \\Delta d/d\ndisagree with the leading-order pQCD prediction assuming hadron helicity\nconservation. Results of precision measurements of the g_2 structure function\nto study higher-twist effects are presented. The data indicate a significant\nhigher-twist (twist-3 or higher) effect. The second moment of the spin\nstructure functions and the twist-3 matrix element d_2 results were extracted.\nThe high Q^2 result was compared with a Lattice QCD calculation. Results on the\nresonance spin-structure functions in the intermediate Q^2 range are presented,\nwhich, in combination with DIS data, enable a detailed study of quark-hadron\nduality in spin-structure functions. Finally, an experiment to study neutron\ntransversity and transverse spin asymmetries is discussed. A future plan with\nthe 12 GeV energy upgrade at JLab is briefly outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 20:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

At every round of the game,\neach player simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointly\ndetermine the transition to a successor state. Two basic objectives are the\nsafety objective: ``stay forever in a set F of states'', and its dual, the\nreachability objective, ``reach a set R of states''. We present in this paper a\nstrategy improvement algorithm for computing the value of a concurrent safety\ngame, that is, the maximal probability with which player 1 can enforce the\nsafety objective. The algorithm yields a sequence of player-1 strategies which\nensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to the value of the\nsafety game.\n  The significance of the result is twofold. First, while strategy improvement\nalgorithms were known for Markov decision processes and turn-based games, as\nwell as for concurrent reachability games, this is the first strategy\nimprovement algorithm for concurrent safety games. Second, and most\nimportantly, the improvement algorithm provides a way to approximate the value\nof a concurrent safety game from below (the known value-iteration algorithms\napproximate the value from above). Thus, when used together with\nvalue-iteration algorithms, or with strategy improvement algorithms for\nreachability games, our algorithm leads to the first practical algorithm for\ncomputing converging upper and lower bounds for the value of reachability and\nsafety games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2008 05:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

The following hyperthermophile genomes\nincorporated in our software were used for these studies: M.jannaschii,\nM.kandleri, A.fulgidus and 3 species of Pyrococcus. Common genes were annotated\nand grouped according to their roles in cellular processes when information was\navailable and proteins not previously implicated in the heat-adaptation of\nhyperthermophiles were identified. Additional experimental data is needed in\norder to learn more about these proteins. To address a non-gene based\ncomponents of thermal adaptation, all sequenced extremophiles were analysed for\ntheir GC contents and aminoacid hydrophobicity. We develop a prediction model\nfor optimal growth temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2008 07:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We develop, test, and apply a precise and\naccurate technique to calculate the correlation dimension Dc of the\ndistribution of HII regions in a sample of disk galaxies. We find that the\ndetermination of Dc is limited by the number of HII regions, since if there are\n< 100 regions available then a bias tending to underestimate the dimension is\nproduced. The reliable results are distributed in the range 1.5 < Dc < 2.0 with\nan average value Dc = 1.81. This corresponds to a three-dimensional dimension\nof Df = 2.73, very similar to the value measured in the interstellar clouds.\nHowever, we get significant variations in the fractal dimension among galaxies,\ncontrary to a universal picture sometimes claimed in literature.

The faintest\ngalaxies tend to distribute their HII regions in more clustered (less uniform)\npatterns.

We suggest that\nthis unique kinematical difference between these components in the SMC can be\ncaused by a major merger event which occurred in the early stage of the SMC\nformation. Our simulations show that dissipative dwarf-dwarf merging can\ntransform two gas-rich dwarf irregulars into a new dwarf, which consists of a\nspheroidal stellar component and a rotating extended HI disk. The remnant of\nthis dwarf-dwarf merging shows significantly different kinematics between stars\nand gas, in the sense that a gas disk rotates rapidly while a stellar component\nshows little rotation. We thus suggest that the simulated dwarf having a\ndynamically hot spheroid and an extended gas disk finally evolves into the\npresent SMC after efficient stripping of the outer gas via tidal fields of the\nGalaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. We also suggest that spatial\ndistributions and kinematics of RGB and AGB stars with different ages in the\npossible spheroidal component of the SMC can provide valuable information on\nwhether and when a past major merger event really occurred in the SMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2008 09:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This symmetry is\nboth suggested from the striking invariance of high-quality lattice data for\nthe instanton size distribution under inversion of the instanton size rho -->\n<rho>^2 / rho and from the known validity of space-time inversion symmetry in\nthe classical instanton sector. We project the instanton calculus onto the\nfour-dimensional surface of a five-dimensional sphere via conformal\nstereographic mapping, before investigating conformal inversion. This\nprojection to a compact, curved geometry is both to avoid the occurence of\ndivergences and to introduce the average instanton size <rho> from the lattice\ndata as a new length scale. The average instanton size is identified with the\nradius b of this 5d-sphere and acts as the conformal inversion radius. For b =\n<rho>, our corresponding results are almost perfectly symmetric under\nspace-time inversion and in good qualitative agreement with the lattice data.\nFor rho / b --> 0, we recover the familiar results of instanton perturbation\ntheory in flat 4d-space. Moreover, we illustrate that a (weakly broken)\nconformal inversion symmetry would have significant consequences for QCD beyond\ninstantons. As a further successful test for inversion symmetry, we present\nstriking implications for another instanton dominated lattice observable, the\nchirality-flip ratio in the QCD vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2008 14:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-09"}

A new modelling approach was developed to determine the\nconstraints that can be set on the radial extent of excess emission. We confirm\nthe presence of warm dust around 3 of the candidates (eta Corvi, HD145263 and\nHD202406), and present constraints on the emitting dust regions. Of 2\nalternative models for the eta Corvi excess emission, we find that a model with\n1 hot dust component at <3 AU (combined with the known submm dust population)\nfits the data better at the 2.6sigma level than an alternative model with 2\npopulations of dust in the mid-IR. We identify several systems which have a\ncompanion (HD65277 and HD79873) or background object (HD53246, HD123356 and\nHD128400) responsible for their mid-infrared excess, and for 3 other systems we\nwere able to rule out a point-like source near the star at the level of excess\nobserved in lower resolution observations (HD12039, HD69830 and HD191089). Hot\ndust sources are either young and possibly primordial or transitional, or have\nrelatively small radius steady-state planetesimal belts, or they are old and\nluminous with transient emission. High resolution imaging can be used to\nconstrain the location of the disk and help to discriminate between different\nmodels of disk emission. For some small disks, interferometry is needed to\nresolve the disk location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2008 11:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These sources are highly\nvariable, and hence they should be associated with compact objects.\nMicroquasars are objects undergoing accretion with relativistic jets; if such\nan object has a low-mass, evolved, donor star, it might be found in the\nGalactic halo. If these low-mass microquasars can generate detectable gamma-ray\nemission, then they are natural candidates to account for the halo high-energy\nsources. We aim to construct models for high-energy emission of low-mass\nmicroquasars, which could produce a significant luminosity in the gamma-ray\ndomain. We consider that a significant fraction of the relativistic particles\nin the jets of low-mass microquasars are protons and then we study the\nproduction of high-energy emission through proton synchrotron radiation and\nphotopion production. Photopair production and leptonic processes are\nconsidered as well.

We\nindentified five spectral features, which are grouped into red-shifted (-1.9\nand -2.7 km/s) and blue-shifted (-3.8, -4.2, and -4.9 km/s), and we detected\nrapid variabilities of these maser features within a monitoring period of 81\ndays. The red-shifted features decreased in flux density to 50% of its initial\nvalue, while the flux density of the blue-shifted features rapidly increased\nwithin a 30 days. The time variation of these maser features showed two\nremarkable properties; synchronization and anti-correlation between the\nred-shifted and the blue-shifted. The spatial distribution of the maser spots\nobtained by the JVN observation showed an arclike structure with a scale of\n$\\sim$1400 AU, and separations of the five maser features were found to be\nlarger than 100 AU. The absolute position of the methanol maser was also\nobtained based on the phase-referencing observations, and the arclike structure\nwere found to be associated with the Cep A-HW2 object, with the elongation of\nthe arclike structure nearly perpendicularly to the radio continuum jet from\nthe Cep A-HW2 object. These properties of the masers, namely, the\nsynchronization of flux variation, and the spectral and spatial isolation of\nfeatures, suggest that the collisional excitation by shock wave from a common\nexciting source is unlikely. Instead, the synchronized time variation of the\nmasers can be explained if all the maser features are excited by infrared\nradiation from dust which is heated by a common exciting source with a rapid\nvariability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2008 14:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Hydrogen and helium lines are key in probing different parts of the\nprominence structure and inferring the plasma parameters. However, the\ninterpretation of observations, being either spectroscopic or obtained with\nimaging, is not straightforward. Their resonance lines are optically thick, and\nthe prominence plasma is out of local thermodynamic equilibrium due to the\nstrong incident radiation coming from the solar disk. In view of the shift of\nthe incident radiation occurring when the prominence plasma flows radially, it\nis essential to take into account velocity fields in the prominence diagnostic.\nTherefore we need to investigate the effects of the radial motion of the\nprominence plasma on hydrogen and helium lines. The method that we use is the\nresolution of the radiative transfer problem in the hydrogen and helium lines\nout of local thermodynamic equilibrium. We study the variation of the computed\nintegrated intensities in H and He lines with the radial velocity of the\nprominence plasma.
