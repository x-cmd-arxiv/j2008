The brightest X-ray source\nin the cluster, CXO J164710.2-455216, is a slowly spinning (10 s) single\nneutron star and potentially a magnetar. Since this source was argued to be a\nmember of the cluster, the neutron star progenitor must have been very massive\n(M_zams > 40 Msun) as noted by Muno et al. (2006).

We point out while single star progenitors below M_zams < 20 Msun\nform neutron stars, binary evolution completely changes the progenitor mass\nrange. In particular, we demonstrate that mass loss in Roche lobe overflow\nenables stars as massive as 50-80 Msun, under favorable conditions, to form\nneutron stars.

Hence, the\nexistence of a neutron star in a given stellar population does not necessarily\nplace stringent constraints on progenitor mass when binary interactions are\nconsidered. It is concluded that the existence of a neutron star in Westerlund\n1 cluster is fully consistent with the generally accepted framework of stellar\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2008 16:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The impact from\nprimordial stellar radiation is far reaching and affects subsequent star and\ngalaxy formation. In this thesis, we present results from adaptive mesh\nrefinement calculations of the formation of the first galaxies. We gradually\nintroduce important physical processes, such as molecular hydrogen cooling and\nstellar feedback, to base models that only consider atomic hydrogen and helium\ncooling. In these base models, we find that gas in dark matter halos with\nmasses ~10^8 solar masses centrally collapse before multiple fragmentation\noccurs in a global disc. We then investigate the importance of molecular\nhydrogen cooling in early structure formation in the presence of a soft\nultraviolet radiation background. We find that molecular hydrogen plays an\nimportant role in star formation in halos well below a virial temperature of\n10,000 K even in the most extreme assumptions of negative radiative feedback.\nWe also present results from the first radiation hydrodynamics calculations of\nearly dwarf galaxy formation. We develop a novel technique, adaptive ray\ntracing, to accurately transport radiation from primordial stars. We find\nprimordial stellar feedback alters the landscape of early galaxy formation in\nthat its angular momentum is increased and baryon fractions are decreased. We\nalso describe the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium and early dwarf\ngalaxies. Finally we explore cosmological reionization by these massive,\nmetal-free stars and its effects on star formation in early galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2008 17:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-28"}

Three models are examined:\nthe quartic double-well potential $V(x)=x^4-5x^2$, the cubic potential\n$V(x)=frac{1}{2}x^2-gx^3$, and the periodic potential $V(x)=-\\cos x$. For the\nquartic potential a wave packet that is initially localized in one side of the\ndouble-well can tunnel to the other side. Complex solutions to the classical\nequations of motion exhibit a remarkably analogous behavior. Furthermore,\nclassical solutions come in two varieties, which resemble the even-parity and\nodd-parity quantum-mechanical bound states. For the cubic potential, a quantum\nwave packet that is initially in the quadratic portion of the potential near\nthe origin will tunnel through the barrier and give rise to a probability\ncurrent that flows out to infinity. The complex solutions to the corresponding\nclassical equations of motion exhibit strongly analogous behavior. For the\nperiodic potential a quantum particle whose energy lies between -1 and 1 can\ntunnel repeatedly between adjacent classically allowed regions and thus execute\na localized random walk as it hops from region to region. Furthermore, if the\nenergy of the quantum particle lies in a conduction band, then the particle\ndelocalizes and drifts freely through the periodic potential. A classical\nparticle having complex energy executes a qualitatively analogous local random\nwalk, and there exists a narrow energy band for which the classical particle\nbecomes delocalized and moves freely through the potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2008 19:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-28"}

Here we show\ntheoretically how to produce squeezed states of microwave radiation in a\nsuperconducting oscillator with tunable parameters. The circuit impedance, and\nthus the resonance frequency, can be changed by controlling the state of an RF\nSQUID inductively coupled to the oscillator. By repeatedly shifting the\nresonance frequency between any two values, it is possible to produce squeezed\nand subthermal states of the electromagnetic field in the (0.1--10) GHz range,\neven when the relative frequency change is small. We propose experimental\nprotocols for the verification of squeezed state generation, and for their use\nto improve the readout fidelity when such oscillators serve as quantum\ntransducers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2008 22:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The numerical solution to\nthe integro-differential Smoluchowski coagulation equation at every time step,\nfor every particle size, and at every spatial location is computationally\nexpensive, and serves as the primary bottleneck in running evolutionary models\nover long periods of time. The advantage of using the moments method comes in\nthe computational time savings gained from only tracking the time rate of\nchange of the moments, as opposed to tracking the entire mass histogram which\ncan contain hundreds or thousands of bins depending on the desired accuracy.\nThe collision kernels of the coagulation equation contain all the necessary\ninformation about particle relative velocities, cross-sections, and sticking\ncoefficients. We show how arbitrary collision kernels may be treated. We\ndiscuss particle relative velocities in both turbulent and non-turbulent\nregimes.

That is, each\nuser would like to obtain its own confidential message in a reliable and safe\nmanner.

To explore issues of turbulence and fossil cavities\ndriven by young stellar outflows we present a series of numerical simulations\ntracking the evolution of transient protostellar jets driven into a turbulent\nmedium. Our simulations show both the effect of turbulence on outflow\nstructures and, conversely, the effect of outflows on the ambient turbulence.\nWe demonstrate how turbulence will lead to strong modifications in jet\nmorphology. More importantly, we demonstrate that individual transient outflows\nhave the capacity to re-energize decaying turbulence.

The description of a system in the topos becomes similar to this given\nby classical theory, up to multiplication of observables. Logic of the emergent\ntheory is rather intuitionistic than classical. Adding to the language the type\nof self-adjoint operators and their products, which are interpreted by the\non-stages daseinisations and their products, one gets commuting presheaves in\nthe topos. The interpretation agrees with on-stages daseinisations of squares\nup to some automorphisms of the topos. The uncertainty principle does not hold\nfor such an interpretation.

Assuming that a quantum\nsystem modifies the local spacetime structure and interacts with a\ngravitational field via the spectral topos, the lowest energy modes of a\nquantum harmonic oscillator are gravitationally nullified.
