One science goal of the upcoming Planck mission is to perform a\nfull-sky cluster survey based on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, which\nleads to the question of how such a survey would be affected by cosmological\nmodels with a different history of structure formation than LCDM. One class of\nthese models are early dark energy (EDE) cosmologies, where the dark energy\ncontribution does not vanish at early times.\n  Aims. Since structures grow slower in the presence of EDE, one expects an\nincrease in the number of galaxy clusters compared to LCDM at intermediate and\nhigh redshifts, which could explain the reported excess of the angular CMB\npower spectrum on cluster scales via an enhanced SZ contribution. We study the\nimpact of EDE on Planck's expected cluster sample.\n  Methods. To obtain realistic simulations, we constructed full-sky SZ maps for\nEDE and LCDM cosmologies, taking angular cluster correlation into account.\nUsing these maps, we simulated Planck observations with and without Galactic\nforegrounds and fed the results into our filter pipeline based on the spherical\nmulti-frequency matched filters.\n  Results. For the case of EDE cosmologies, we clearly find an increase in the\ndetected number of clusters compared to the fiducial LCDM case. This shows that\nthe spherical multi-frequency matched filter is sensitive enough to find\ndeviations from the LCDM sample, being caused by EDE. In addition we find an\ninteresting effect of EDE on the completeness of the cluster sample, such that\nEDE helps to obtain cleaner samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2008 16:57:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 15:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-12"}

The Hall resistivity can take larger\nvalues than previously found when the negative charge is mostly carried by dust\ngrains.

The friction force due to elastic collisions\nbetween particles of different species in the multi-component interstellar\nplasma is a nonlinear function of the temperature of each species and the Mach\nnumber of the relative drift velocity.

As a byproduct, all the Friedman universes for which observers at\nrest feel the vacuum as a thermal bath are listed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2008 20:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2008 09:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We\ndetermine the z < 0.05 GSMF using the New York University - Value-Added Galaxy\nCatalog sample of 49968 galaxies derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and\nvarious estimates of stellar mass. The GSMF shows clear evidence for a low-mass\nupturn and is fitted with a double Schechter function that has alpha_2 =~ -1.6.\nAt masses below ~ 10^8.5 Msun, the GSMF may be significantly incomplete because\nof missing low surface-brightness galaxies. One interpretation of the stellar\nmass-metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction of\navailable baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. Using this\nprincipal, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellar\nmass and present an `implied baryonic mass function'. This function has a\nfaint-end slope, alpha_2 =~ -1.9. Thus, we find evidence that the slope of the\nlow-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as the\nhalo mass function. We illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic mass\nfunction --> galaxy baryonic mass function --> GSMF. This demonstrates the\nrequirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ~ 10^11\nMsun corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. The baryonic-infall\nefficiency may have levelled off at lower masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2008 20:04:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 May 2008 10:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We relate this finding to the specific property of\nthe thin disc in this metallicity range, where stars are shown to rotate around\nthe Galaxy faster than the Sun. Their orbital parameters are conveniently\nexplained if they are contaminants coming from the outer Galactic disc, as a\nresult of radial mixing.

A well-defined main\nsequence turn-off (MSTO) is found to be located at V$_{0,MSTO}\\sim$23.5 mag.\nThe distance modulus is derived as $(m-M)_0=19.93\\pm0.1$ (corresponding to a\ndistance D$=96.8\\pm4$ kpc) from the V-band magnitude of the horizontal branch\n(V$_{0,HB}=20.45\\pm0.02$). The mean metallicity of the RGB stars is estimated\nby the V$-$I colour to [Fe/H]$\\sim-2.0$. The turn-off age estimated by\noverlaying the theoretical isochrones reveals that most of stars in the UMa I\ndSph are formed at very early epoch ($\\sim12$Gyrs ago). The isopleth map of\nstellar number density of the UMa I dSph, based upon the resolved star counts\nof MS, RGB, HB stars as well as blue stragglers (BS), shows that the morphology\nof the UMa I dSph is quite irregular and distorted, suggesting that the galaxy\nis in a process of disruption. The very old and metal-poor nature of the\nstellar population implies that the star formation history of this newly\ndiscoverd faint dSph may have been different from other well-known `classical'\ndSphs, which show significant stellar population of intermediate age. The\nstellar population of the UMa I dSph closely resembles that of Galactic old\nmetal-poor globular cluster, but its size is typical of Galactic dSphs\n(r$_{e}$=188 [pc], r$_{1/2}$=300 [pc]), and the shape of its spatial density\ncontours suggests that it is undergoing tidal disruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2008 08:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Signatures of ion-cyclotron resonance have already been observed\nin situ in the solar wind (HELIOS spacecrafts) and, recently, in the upper\ncorona (UVCS/SOHO remote-sensing results). We propose a method to constrain\nboth the Alfven wave amplitude and the preferential heating induced by\nion-cyclotron resonance, above a partially developed polar coronal hole\nobserved with the SUMER/SOHO spectrometer. The instrumental stray light\ncontribution is first substracted from the spectra. By supposing that the\nnon-thermal velocity is related to the Alfven wave amplitude, it is constrained\nthrough a density diagnostic and the gradient of the width of the Mg X 625 A\nline. The temperatures of several coronal ions, as functions of the distance\nabove the limb, are then determined by substracting the non-thermal component\nto the observed line widths. The effect of stray light explains the apparent\ndecrease with height in the width of several spectral lines, this decrease\nusually starting about 0.1-0.2 Rs above the limb. This result rules out any\ndirect evidence of damping of the Alfven waves, often suggested by other\nauthors. We also find that the ions with the smallest charge-to-mass ratios are\nthe hottest ones at a fixed altitude and that they are subject to a stronger\nheating, as compared to the others, between 57\" and 102\" above the limb. This\nconstitutes a serious clue to ion-cyclotron preferential heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2008 10:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the process Fisher's unpublished 1930\ncharacterization of conditions for the consistency and efficiency of maximum\nlikelihood estimates is presented, and the mathematical basis of his three\nproofs discussed. In particular, Fisher's derivation of the information\ninequality is seen to be derived from his work on the analysis of variance, and\nhis later approach via estimating functions was derived from Euler's Relation\nfor homogeneous functions. The reaction to Fisher's work is reviewed, and some\nlessons drawn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2008 11:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

We investigate the influence of the toroidal shape and equilibrium\ncondition on the thresholds of the friction-induced instability and on their\nrelevance for emerging magnetic flux in solar-like stars. Analytical\ninstability criteria are derived for axial symmetric perturbations and for flux\nrings in the equatorial plane by analysing the sequence of principal minors of\nthe coefficient matrices of dispersion polynomials. The general case of\nnon-equatorial flux rings is investigated numerically by considering flux tubes\nin the solar overshoot region. The friction-induced instability occurs when an\neigenmode reverses its direction of propagation due to advection, typically\nfrom the retrograde to the prograde direction. Since the reversal requires a\ncertain relative velocity difference between plasma inside the flux tube and\nthe environment, the instability criterion depends on the location and field\nstrength of the flux ring. The friction-induced instability sets in at lower\nfield strengths than buoyancy- and tension-driven instabilities. Its threshold\nis independent of the strength of friction, but the growth rates depend on the\nstrength of the frictional coupling between flux tube and environment. The\nfriction-induced instability lowers the critical magnetic field strength beyond\nwhich flux tubes are subject to growing perturbations. Whereas buoyancy- and\ntension-driven instabilities depend on the magnetic field strength alone, the\ndependence of hydrodynamic drag on the tube diameter gives rise to an\nadditional dependence of growth times on the magnetic flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2008 11:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Building on previously\nobtained results for Green functions in the Yang-Mills sector we analytically\nderive the existence of power-law infrared singularities for this vertex. We\nestablish that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking leads to the self-consistent\ngeneration of components of the quark-gluon vertex forbidden when chiral\nsymmetry is forced to stay in the Wigner-Weyl mode. In the latter case the\nrunning strong coupling assumes an infrared fixed point. If chiral symmetry is\nbroken, either dynamically or explicitely, the running coupling is infrared\ndivergent. Based on a truncation for the quark-gluon vertex Dyson-Schwinger\nequation which respects the analytically determined infrared behavior numerical\nresults for the coupled system of the quark propagator and vertex\nDyson-Schwinger equation are presented. The resulting quark mass function as\nwell as the vertex function show only a very weak dependence on the current\nquark mass in the deep infrared. From this we infer by an analysis of the\nquark-quark scattering kernel a linearly rising quark potential with an almost\nmass independent string tension in the case of broken chiral symmetry.\nEnforcing chiral symmetry does lead to a Coulomb type potential. Therefore we\nconclude that chiral symmetry breaking and confinement are closely related.\nFurthermore we discuss aspects of confinement as the absence of long-range\nvan-der-Waals forces and Casimir scaling.

Measures of third-order\nclustering are sensitive to the structure of filaments and voids in the\nuniverse and are useful for studying large-scale structure. Thus, statistics of\nthese third-order measures can be used to test and constrain parameters in\ncosmological models. Third-order measures such as the three-point correlation\nfunction are now commonly estimated for galaxy surveys. Studies of third-order\nclustering of absorption systems will complement these analyses. We define a\nstatistic, which we denote K, that measures third-order clustering of a data\nset of point observations and focus on estimating this statistic for an\nabsorber catalog. The statistic K can be considered a third-order version of\nthe second-order Ripley K-function and allows one to study the abundance of\nvarious configurations of point triplets.

Since most of this\nthree-dimensional space is not probed by the lines of sight, edge corrections\nbecome important.

When the flow\nfield effectively escorts the system along a near-equilibrium path, the free\nenergy estimate converges efficiently and accurately. We illustrate our method\non a model system, and discuss the general applicability of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2008 15:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
