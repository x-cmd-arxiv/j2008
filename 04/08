The baseline design of the\nPierre Auger Observatory was optimized for the highest energies. The surface\narray is fully efficient above $3 \\times 10^{18}$ eV and, even if the hybrid\nmode can extend this range below $10^{18}$ eV, the second knee and a\nconsiderable portion of the wide ankle structure are left outside its operating\nrange. Therefore, in order to encompass these spectral features and gain\nfurther insight into the cosmic ray composition variation along the transition\nregion, enhancements to the surface and fluorescence components of the baseline\ndesign are being implemented that will lower the full efficiency regime of the\nObservatory down to $\\sim 10^{17}$ eV. The surface enhancements consist of a\ngraded infilled area of standard Auger water Cherenkov detectors deployed in\ntwo triangular grids of 433 m and 750 m of spacing. Each surface station inside\nthis area will have an associated muon counter detector. The fluorescence\nenhancement, on the other hand, consists of three additional fluorescence\ntelescopes with higher elevation angle ($30^\\circ-58^\\circ$) than the ones in\noperation at present. The aim of this paper is threefold. We study the effect\nof the segmentation of the muon counters and find an analytical expression to\ncorrect for the under counting due to muon pile-up. We also present a detailed\nmethod to reconstruct the muon lateral distribution function for the 750 m\nspacing array.

It is assumed that every node in the\nnetwork has its own power constraint. A two-step amplify-and-forward protocol\nis used, in which the transmitter and relays not only use match filters to form\na beam at the receiver but also adaptively adjust their transmit powers\naccording to the channel strength information. For a network with any number of\nrelays and no direct link, the optimal power control is solved analytically.\nThe complexity of finding the exact solution is linear in the number of relays.\nOur results show that the transmitter should always use its maximal power and\nthe optimal power used at a relay is not a binary function. It can take any\nvalue between zero and its maximum transmit power. Also, this value depends on\nthe quality of all other channels in addition to the relay's own channels.\nDespite this coupling fact, distributive strategies are proposed in which, with\nthe aid of a low-rate broadcast from the receiver, a relay needs only its own\nchannel information to implement the optimal power control. Simulated\nperformance shows that network beamforming achieves the maximal diversity and\noutperforms other existing schemes. Then, beamforming in networks with a direct\nlink are considered.

Optical photometry and VLT\nspectroscopy 2 weeks after the GALEX detections link the onset of UV emission\nto the time of shock breakout. Using radiation hydrodynamics and non-LTE\nradiative transfer simulations, and starting from a standard red supergiant\n(RSG; Type II-P SN progenitor) star evolved self-consistently from the main\nsequence to iron core collapse, we model the shock breakout phase and the 55 hr\nthat follow.

The long-time averaged entanglement as\na function of the position of an initially localized wave packet very closely\ncorrelates with the classical phase space surface of section -- it is nearly\nuniform in the chaotic sea, and reproduces the detailed structure of the\nregular islands. The uniform value in the chaotic sea is explained by the\nrandom state conjecture. As classically chaotic dynamics take localized\ndistributions in phase space to random distributions, quantized versions take\nlocalized coherent states to pseudo-random states in Hilbert space. Such random\nstates are highly entangled, with an average value near that of the maximally\nentangled state. For a map with global chaos, we derive that value based on new\nanalytic results for the typical entanglement in a subspace defined by the\nsymmetries of the system.\n  For a mixed phase space, we use the Percival conjecture to identify a\n\"chaotic subspace\" of the Hilbert space. The typical entanglement, averaged\nover the unitarily invariant Haar measure in this subspace, agrees with the\nlong-time averaged entanglement for initial states in the chaotic sea. In all\ncases the dynamically generated entanglement is predicted by a unitary ensemble\nof random states, even though the system is time-reversal invariant, and the\nFloquet operator is a member of the circular orthogonal ensemble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2008 20:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Although\nthese masers are the most abundant of the maser species occurring during\nhigh-mass star formation, most magnetic field measurements in the high-density\ngas currently come from OH and H2 O maser observations.\n  Methods: The 100-m Effelsberg telescope was used to measure the Zeeman\nsplitting of 6.7 GHz methanol masers for the first time. The observations were\nperformed on a sample of 24 bright northern maser sources.\n  Results: Significant Zeeman splitting is detected in 17 of the sources with\nan average magnitude of 0.56 m/s . Using the current best estimate of the 6.7\nGHz methanol maser Zeeman splitting coefficient and a geometrical correction,\nthis corresponds to an absolute magnetic field strength of 23 mG in the\nmethanol maser region.\n  Conclusions: The magnetic field is dynamically important in the dense maser\nregions. No clear relation is found with the available OH maser magnetic field\nmeasurements. The general sense of direction of the magnetic field is\nconsistent with other Galactic magnetic field measurements, although a few of\nthe masers display a change of direction between different maser features.

For comparison, we have examined the relationship between the\n[O III] 5007, the 2-10 keV and the 14-195 keV luminosities for the same set of\nobjects.

In this\npaper, we explore Shannon-theoretic performance limits when ADC precision is\ndrastically reduced, from typical values of 8-12 bits used in current\ncommunication transceivers, to 1-3 bits. The goal is to obtain insight on\nwhether DSP-centric transceiver architectures are feasible as communication\nbandwidths scale up, recognizing that high-precision ADC at high sampling rates\nis either unavailable, or too costly or power-hungry. Specifically, we evaluate\nthe communication limits imposed by low-precision ADC for the ideal real\ndiscrete-time Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, under an average\npower constraint on the input. For an ADC with K quantization bins (i.e., a\nprecision of log2 K bits), we show that the Shannon capacity is achievable by a\ndiscrete input distribution with at most K + 1 mass points. For 2-bin (1-bit)\nsymmetric ADC, this result is tightened to show that binary antipodal signaling\nis optimum for any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For multi-bit ADC, the capacity\nis computed numerically, and the results obtained are used to make the\nfollowing encouraging observations regarding system design with low-precision\nADC : (a) even at moderately high SNR of up to 20 dB, 2-3 bit quantization\nresults in only 10-20% reduction of spectral efficiency, which is acceptable\nfor large communication bandwidths, (b) standard equiprobable pulse amplitude\nmodulation with ADC thresholds set to implement maximum likelihood hard\ndecisions is asymptotically optimum at high SNR, and works well at low to\nmoderate SNRs as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2008 02:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-09"}

With slit-less spectroscopy we detected ten\nH_alpha emission stars around the globule, six of which are near the tip of the\nglobule and are aligned along the direction to the exciting stars.

Near-IR and\noptical photometry suggests that four of these six stars are low-mass young\nstellar objects (YSOs) with masses of ~0.4 M_sun. Their estimated ages of ~1\nMyr indicate that they were formed at the tip in advance of the formation of\nthe IRAS source. Therefore, it is likely that sequential star formation has\nbeen taking place along the direction from the exciting stars towards the IRAS\nsource, due to the UV impact of the exciting star(s).

Under independence, we\npropose an estimator $\\hat{\\pi}_0$ based on density estimation using both\nhistograms and cross-validation.

Much of the progress in understanding the physics of galaxy\nclustering and comparison with observations would not have been possible\nwithout N-Body simulations. Given the importance of this tool, it is essential\nto understand its limitations as ignoring these can easily lead to interesting\nbut unreliable results. In this paper we study the limitations due to the\nfinite size of the simulation volume. In an earlier work we proposed a\nformalism for estimating the effects of a finite box-size on physical\nquantities and applied it to estimate the effect on the amplitude of\nclustering, mass function. Here, we extend the same analysis and estimate the\neffect on skewness and kurtosis in the perturbative regime. We also test the\nanalytical predictions from the earlier work as well as those presented in this\npaper. We find good agreement between the analytical models and simulations for\nthe two point correlation function and skewness. We also discuss the effect of\na finite box size on relative velocity statistics and find the effects for\nthese quantities scale in a manner that retains the dependence on the averaged\ncorrelation function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2008 15:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2008 10:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 03:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-09"}

We characterise the IR emission bands,\ndue to fluorescence by PAH molecules, in the spectra of Herbig Ae/Be stars and\nlink observed variations to spatial aspects of the mid-IR emission. We analysed\ntwo PAH dominated spectra from a sample of 15 Herbig Ae/Be stars observed with\nSpitzer and derive profiles of the major PAH bands. The shape and the measured\nband characteristics show pronounced variations between the two Spitzer\nspectra. Those variations parallel those found between three ISO spectra of\nother, well-studied, Herbig Ae/Be stars. The derived profiles are compared to\nthose from a broad sample of sources. The Spitzer and ISO spectra exhibit\ncharacteristics commonly interpreted respectively as interstellar matter-like\n(ISM), non-ISM-like, or a combination of the two. We argue that the PAH\nemission detected from the sources exhibiting a combination of ISM-like and\nnon-ISM-like characteristics indicates the presence of two dissimilar,\nspatially separated, PAH families. As the shape of the individual PAH band\nprofiles reflects the composition of the PAH molecules involved, this\ndemonstrates that PAHs in subsequent, evolutionary linked stages of star\nformation are different from those in the general ISM, implying active\nchemistry. None of the detected PAH emission can be associated with the\n(unresolved) disk and is thus associated with the circumstellar cloud. This\nimplies that chemical changes may already occur in the natal cloud and not\nnecessarily in the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2008 07:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

With the present paper, we shed light on the geometrical\nstructure of the circumstellar matter which produces the near- to mid-infrared\nflux excess, and construct an overall image of the source's appearance and\nevolutionary status. The H-, K- and N-band brightness distribution of MWC 297\nis probed with the ESO interferometric spectrographs AMBER and MIDI. We have\nobtained visibility measurements on 3 AMBER and 12 MIDI baselines, covering a\nwide range of spatial frequencies. We have reconstructed the brightness\ndistribution in H, K and N with a geometric model consisting of three Gaussian\ndisks with different extent and brightness temperature. This model can account\nfor the entire near- to mid-IR emission of MWC 297. The near- and mid-IR\nemission, including the silicate emission at 10 micron, emanates from a very\ncompact region (FWHM < 1.5 AU) around the central star.

Conservative evolution fails to produce the large\nfraction with a high mass ratio: i.e. q in [0.4-0.6]. Interacting binaries thus\nhave to lose mass before or during Algolism. During RLOF mass is transferred\ncontinuously from donor to gainer. The gainer spins up; sometimes up to\ncritical velocity. Equatorial material on the gainer is therefore less bound to\nthe system. The material coming from the donor through the first Langrangian\npoint impinges violently on the surface of the gainer or the edge of the\naccretion disc, creating a hot spot in the area of impact. The sum of\nrotational energy (fast rotation) and radiative energy (hot spot) depends on\nthe mass-loss rate. The sum of both energies on a test mass located in the\nimpact area equals exactly its binding energy at some critical value. As long\nas the mass transfer rate is smaller than this value the gainer accepts all the\nmass coming from the donor: RLOF happens conservatively. But as soon as the\ncritical rate is exceeded the gainer will acquire no more than the critical\nvalue and RLOF runs into its liberal era. Low mass binaries never achieve\nmass-loss rates larger than the critical value. Intermediate mass binaries\nevolve mainly conservatively but mass will be blown away from the system during\nthe short era of rapid mass transfer soon after RLOF-ignition. Binaries with\n9+5.4 solar masses (P in [2-4] d) evolve almost always conservatively. Only\nduring some 20,000 years the gainer is not capable of grasping all the material\nthat comes from the donor. During this short lapse of time a significant\nfraction of the mass of the system is blown into interstellar space. The mass\nratio bin [0.4-0.6] is now much better represented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2008 08:51:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 08:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-02"}

Until now two of the\ndefining characteristics of IPs have been the presence of high (and complex)\nabsorption in their X-ray spectra and the presence of a stable modulation in\nthe X-ray light curve which is a signature of the spin period, or the beat\nperiod, of the accreting white dwarf.

We present an idealised numerical model of three-dimensional\ncompressible magnetoconvection at the photosphere, for a range of values of the\nmagnetic Reynolds number. In the absence of a magnetic field, the convection is\nhighly supercritical and is characterised by a pattern of vigorous,\ntime-dependent, ``granular'' motions. When a weak magnetic field is imposed\nupon the convection, magnetic flux is swept into the convective downflows where\nit forms localised concentrations. Unless this process is significantly\ninhibited by magnetic diffusion, the resulting fields are often much greater\nthan $B_e$, and the high magnetic pressure in these flux elements leads to\ntheir being partially evacuated. Some of these flux elements contain\nultra-intense magnetic fields that are significantly greater than $B_p$. Such\nfields are contained by a combination of the thermal pressure of the gas and\nthe dynamic pressure of the convective motion, and they are constantly\nevolving. These ultra-intense fields develop owing to nonlinear interactions\nbetween magnetic fields and convection; they cannot be explained in terms of\n``convective collapse'' within a thin flux tube that remains in overall\npressure equilibrium with its surroundings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2008 10:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Young, stellar samples, selected according to their activity, can\nbe used to determine the stellar birthrate in the last billion years. The ROSAT\nNorth Ecliptic Pole survey (NEP), with its moderately deep sensitivity (fluxes\n~10^(-14) erg cm^(-2) sec^(-1)), is the best survey, to date, able to sample\nthe intermediate-age (10^8 - 10^9 years) nearby population. The identification\nprocess of NEP X-ray sources resulted in 144 X-ray sources having a normal\nstellar counterpart, with an excess of yellow stars with respect to model\npredictions. We want to determine if these X-ray active stars are young or\nintermediate-age stars, or active binaries. We acquired high-resolution, high\nsignal-to-noise ratio optical spectra, to determine the age and physical\nproperties of the NEP X-ray-detected stellar sources. We measure the (i)\nlithium abundance using the Li I 6707.8 angstrom line, which is an excellent,\nyouth indicator for our age range of interest; (ii) rotational and radial\nvelocities (through cross-correlation methods); and (iii) chromospheric\nemission. The radial velocities distribution is consistent with that of a young\nfield star population of age 4x10^9 yrs, or younger. Rotational velocity\nmeasurements imply that our sample is dominated by relatively young or\nintermediate-age stars, as confirmed by our lithium measurements. Most of the\ndetected stars probably belong to a young or intermediate-age population. Our\nmeasurements suggest that a burst in the stellar birthrate of a factor of four\noccurred in the last 10^8 years. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility\nthat a small fraction of sources, amongst the fastest of the K-rotators, are\nold binary systems with tidally-locked rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2008 12:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The latter implies disappearance of the volume element\n$\\sqrt{-g}d^4x$ of 4-D space-time. We pay attention that besides $\\sqrt{-g}$,\nthe 4-D space-time differentiable manifold possesses also a \"manifold volume\nmeasure\" (MVM)described by a 4-form which is sign indefinite and generically\nindependent of the metric. The FOF proceeds with originally independent\nconnection and metric structures of the space-time manifold. We bring up the\nquestion whether the FOF should be supplemented with degrees of freedom of MVM.\nAdding such manifold degrees of freedom to the action principle in the FOF we\nrealize very interesting dynamics. Such Two Measures Theory enables radically\nnew approaches to resolution of the cosmological constant problem. We show that\nfine tuning free solutions describing a transition to $\\Lambda =0$ state\ninvolve oscillations of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and MVM around zero.

These giants span a factor of 10 in metallicity and this is the\nfirst study to define the behavior of 19F with metallicity in the bulge. The\nbulge results show an increase in F/O with increasing oxygen. This trend\noverlaps what is found in the disk at comparable metallicities, with the most\noxygen-rich bulge target extending the disk trend. The increase in F/O in the\ndisk arises from 19F synthesis in both asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and\nmetal-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars through stellar winds. The lack of an\ns-process enhancement in the most fluorine-rich bulge giant in this study,\nsuggests that WR stars represented a larger contribution than AGB stars to 19F\nproduction in the bulge when compared to the disk. If this result for fluorine\nis combined with the previously published overall decline in the O/Mg abundance\nratios in metal-rich bulge stars, it suggests that WR winds played a role in\nshaping chemical evolution in the bulge. One star in this study exhibits a very\nlow value of F/O while having a large O-abundance; this chemical mixture can be\nunderstood if this star formed from gas that was enriched by metal-poor\ncore-collapse supernovae and may indicate that chemical evolution in the bulge\nwas inhomogeneous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2008 14:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Since the chromospheric flux is also sensitive to magnetic elements\nsmaller than those contributing to the polarimetric signal, this observation\nsuggests that a larger fraction of the surface magnetic energy is stored in\nlarge scales as rotation increases.
