Many\nheterogeneous centers have different nucleation thresholds when they act in\ncontact or immersion modes, indicating that the mechanisms may be actually\ndifferent for the different modes. Underlying physical reasons for this\nenhancement have remained largely unclear. In this paper we present a model for\nthe thermodynamic enhancement of heterogeneous crystal nucleation in the\ncontact mode compared to the immersion one. To determine if and how the surface\nof a liquid droplet can thermodynamically stimulate its heterogeneous\ncrystallization, we examine crystal nucleation in the immersion and contact\nmodes by deriving and comparing with each other the reversible works of\nformation of crystal nuclei in these cases. As a numerical illustration, the\nproposed model is applied to the heterogeneous nucleation of Ih crystals on\ngeneric macroscopic foreign particles in water droplets at T=253 K. Our results\nshow that the droplet surface does thermodynamically favor the contact mode\nover the immersion one.

Freeman's disk\nassumes a mass density decreasing exponentially with radius which correctly\nproduces rotational velocities which increase from the galactic center to a\nmaximum near the outer core, but then decreases out to the periphery contrary\nto measurements. Mestel's disk assumes a mass distribution decreasing more\nslowly (inversely with radius) that yields a constant rotational velocity\nacross the entire disk, but has an unrealistic central mass singularity and\ndoes not describe the core rotation properly. Thus combine the Freeman and\nMestel disks to utilize their strengths and eliminate their deficiencies.\nUtilize the Freeman formula for the central core, and the Mestel formula beyond\nthe core to the galactic rim. This combined model produces rotation curves\ncomparable to the measurements of mature spiral galaxies.

The knowledge of\nthese parameters allows us a direct comparison of a jet from a Herbig star with\nthose from T Tauri stars.

Aiming to learn about the interplay between\nevolved massive stars and their surroundings, we have carried out CO J=2-1,\nJ=3-2, and (13)CO J=2-1 line observations in a 4'x4' field around the ring\nnebula G79.29+0.46, which is illuminated by a strong candidate to LBV star. The\nwhole field shows extended predominant emission in both CO and (13)CO J=2-1\nlines, which probably comes from the large cloud which contains the star\nforming region DR15. When this large-scale emission is removed, minor scales\nfeatures become evident, particularly in the CO J=3-2 line, strikingly\ncoincident with the ring nebula. The high critical density of CO J=3-2 (some\n10^4 cm^(-3)) gives additional support for the association with the massive\nstar, since high density molecular gas has more chances to survive in such a\nharsh environment. This structure may have been produced by the cumulative\neffect of a strong steady wind in the LBV stage or earlier, which has\ncompressed the surviving parent molecular cloud. In addition, immersed within\nthis CO feature, we have also discovered a higher density clump (at least\nseveral 10^5 cm^(-3)), unresolved by the telescope and probably having a higher\nkinetic temperature. Towards the clump, the presence of a jump of 14-16 km/s in\nthe gas velocity may indicate the existence of a shockfront. This clump may\nhave been created by at least one mass eruption, 10^3 - 10^4 yr ago. Thus, this\nwork shows that not all the molecular gas is destroyed during massive star\nevolution, and consequently we are dealing with a new laboratory where one can\nlearn about the mass-loss phenomena associated to the brief LBV stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2008 15:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The traditional formulations of intruder deduction are\nusually given in natural-deduction-like systems and proving decidability\nrequires significant effort in showing that the rules are \"local\" in some\nsense.

Using standard proof\ntheoretic methods, such as permutability of rules and cut elimination, we show\nthat the intruder deduction problem can be reduced, in polynomial time, to the\nelementary deduction problems, which amounts to solving certain equations in\nthe underlying individual equational theories. We further show that this result\nextends to combinations of disjoint AC-convergent theories whereby the\ndecidability of intruder deduction under the combined theory reduces to the\ndecidability of elementary deduction in each constituent theory.

For the coordinate-coordinates coupling\nscheme the low temperature explicit results for the case of Ohmic,\nexponentially correlated and more generalized heat bath models are derived. In\nall the above mentioned cases free energy and entropy vanish linearly with\ntemperature ($T$) as $T\\to 0$ in conformity with Nernst's theorem.

The case of radiation heat bath shows $T^3$ decay behaviour for\nentropy as $T\\to 0$.

A radial velocity analysis of the absorption\nlines yields K_2 = 168.7+/- 1 km/s.

A complex rotational velocity curve as a\nfunction of orbital phase is detected which has a modulation frequency of twice\nthe orbital frequency, leading to an estimate of the binary inclination angle\nthat is close to 70^o. The minimum and maximum rotational velocities are used\nto indirectly derive a mass ratio of q= 0.6 and a radial velocity\nsemi-amplitude of the white dwarf of K_1 = 101+/-3 km/s. We present an\natmospheric temperature indicator, based on the absorption line ratio of Fe I\nand Cr I lines, whose variation indicates that the secondary star varies from\nK0 to K4 as a function of orbital phase. The ephemeris of the system has been\nrevised, using more than one thousand radial velocity measurements, published\nover nearly five decades.

Static charged\nshells in such a background are also analyzed. First a derivation of the\nequation of motion of such a shell in a $d$-dimensional spacetime is given.\nThen a proof of the cosmic censorship conjecture in a charged collapsing\nframework is presented, and a useful constraint which leads to an upper bound\nfor the rest mass of a charged shell with an empty interior is derived. It is\nalso proved that a shell with total mass equal to charge, i.e., an extremal\nshell, in an empty interior, can only stay in neutral equilibrium outside its\ngravitational radius. This implies that it is not possible to generate a\nregular extremal black hole by placing an extremal dust thin shell within its\nown gravitational radius. Moreover, it is shown, for an empty interior, that\nthe rest mass of the shell is limited from above. Then several types of\nbehavior of oscillatory charged shells are studied.

These probabilities are\nimportant in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and\nengineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large\nfluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory.\nIn the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large\ndeviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine\nand generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and\nother connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in\nan effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is\nthe language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents\nthe basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical\napplications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The\nsecond part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics,\nand shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large\ndeviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of\nphysical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed\ndynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems,\nand chaotic systems.

Motivated by\nthis lack of knowledge, we present a detailed investigation here of the X-ray\nproperties of such a dynamically young system. METHODS: We obtained XMM-Newton\nobservations of one spiral-only system in the new southern compact group\ncatalogue: SCG0018-4854. We present here the results of the data analysis and\ndiscuss them in comparison with the few other similar systems also studied in\nthe X-ray band. RESULTS: The 4 members of SCG0018-4854 emit at a level\ncomparable to what is expected based on their optical properties. We detect the\nlow level diffuse emission between galaxies, which is most likely due to the\npresence of the intergalactic medium. Compared to other spiral--only groups,\nthis could be the coolest system detected so far, although the measurements\nhave large uncertainties.

Up to now, such measurements have been preferentially\ncarried out in the NIR (1 -- 2.5$\\mu m$), where the flux from the cooler\nsecondary is expected to dominate over that from the accretion disc. However,\nhere we present evidence of a significant non-stellar contribution to the NIR\nflux in many of those quiescent X-ray novae that are thought to contain a black\nhole primary.

During\nthe building of the banding structure, we observed the stages of formation,\nmigration of the interface between bands and finally the destabilization of\nthis interface along the vorticity axis. The mechanical signature of these\nprocesses has been indentified in the time series of the shear stress. The\ninterface instability occurs all along the stress plateau, the asymptotic\nwavelength of the patterns increasing with the control parameter typically from\na fraction of the gap width to about four times the gap width. Three main\nregimes of dynamics are highlighted : a spatially stable oscillating mode\napproximately at the middle of the coexistence region flanked by two ranges\nwhere the dynamics appears more exotic with propagative and chaotic events\nrespectively at low and high shear rates. The distribution of small particles\nseeded in the solution strongly suggests that the flow is three-dimensional.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the shear-banding scenario described in this paper\nis not specific to our system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2008 15:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-03"}

The magnetic\nbarrier modifies the energy spectrum of the nanoribbons locally, which results\nin an energy shift of the conductance steps towards higher energies. The\nmagnetic barrier also induces Fabry-Perot type oscillations, provided the edges\nof the barrier are sufficiently sharp. The lowest propagating state present in\nzigzag and metallic armchair nanoribbons prevent confinement of the charge\ncarriers by the magnetic barrier. Disordered edges in nanoribbons tend to\nlocalize the lowest propagating state, which get delocalized in the magnetic\nbarrier region. Thus, in sharp contrast to the case of two-dimensional\ngraphene, the charge carriers in graphene nanoribbons cannot be confined by\nmagnetic barriers. We also present a novel method based on the Green's function\ntechnique for the calculation of the magnetosubband structure, Bloch states and\nmagnetoconductance of the graphene nanoribbons in a perpendicular magnetic\nfield.
