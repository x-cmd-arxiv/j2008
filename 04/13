Our aim here is to introduce\ninteraction of these non-Abelian tensor gauge fields with fermions and bosons.\nWe have found that there exist two series of gauge invariant forms describing\nthis interaction. The linear sum of these forms comprises the general gauge\ninvariant Lagrangian. Studying the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations we\nfound that a particular linear combination of these forms exhibits enhanced\nsymmetry which guarantees the conservation of the corresponding high-rank\ncurrents.

We show that this channel is\nuniquely suited to search for experimental evidence of TeV-scale open string\ntheory. At the parton level, we analyze single photon production in gluon\nfusion, gg \\to \\gamma g, with open string states propagating in intermediate\nchannels. If the photon mixes with the gauge boson of the baryon number, which\nis a common feature of D-brane quivers, the amplitude appears already at the\nstring disk level. It is completely determined by the mixing parameter (which\nis actually determined in the minimal theory) -- and it is otherwise\nmodel-(compactification-) independent. We discuss the string signal cross\nsections as well as the QCD background. The present analysis takes into account\nthe recently obtained decay widths of first Regge recurrences, which are\nnecessary for more precise determination of these cross sections in the\nresonant region. A vital part of the background discussion concerns the\nminimization of misidentified \\pi^0's emerging from high-p_\\perp jets.

It was very popular till one realized that it cannot account for the\nmasses of the neutrinos. The best cure to this problem is to add the 120 Higgs\nrepresentaion, the 'next to minimal' version. To reduce the number of free\nparameters, it was suggested in recent papers to use only real parameters in\nthe superpotential and induce CP violation via complex VEVs. This is what one\nusually calls 'spontaneous CP violation'. The number of free parameters turned\nout, then, to be even smaller than in the original minimal model and good fits\nto all known masses and mixings were obtained. Out of those papers only that of\nAulakh and Garg discusses how CP is spontaneously violated. Some heavy MSSM\nsinglet VEVs generate a phase at high scale and CP violationis carried down to\nthe CKM matrix by the mixing of the scalar MSSM doublets. They study the model\nin great detail and give a large set of solutions. As a proof of principle, two\nof the solutions are shown to induce realistic phenomenological fits.

Since the quasiparticles in this system\nare chiral in nature, tunneling is highly anisotropic, we determine the\ntransmission probabilities for the central and sidebands as the incident angle\nof the electron beam is changed . Furthermore, we investigate how the\ntransmission probabilities change as the width, amplitude and frequency of the\noscillating barrier is changed. An interesting result of our study is that\nperfect transmission for normal incidence that has been reported for a static\nbarrier persists for the oscillating barrier, manifestation of Klein tunneling\nin a time harmonic potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Apr 2008 13:24:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2008 08:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-23"}

The induced\nscattering could hinder propagation of the radio pulse only if close enough to\nthe source a dense enough plasma is presented. The induced scattering within\nthe relativistically moving source places lower limits on the Lorentz factor of\nthe source.
