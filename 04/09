We also find a correlation between the\nrotation velocity (Vrot sin i) and the period of the star: Vrot sin i = (11.5\n+- 0.9) log(P) + (19.8 +- 1.0) [km/s]. Moreover, we observe a systematic shift\nin observational asymmetry curves (noted gamma_O), related to the period of the\nstar, which is not explained by our static model: gamma_O = (10.7+-0.1) log(P)\n+ (9.7+-0.2) [in %] . For long-period Cepheids, in which velocity gradients,\ncompression or shock waves seem to be large compared to short- or medium period\nCepheids we observe indeed a greater systematic shift in asymmetry curves.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2008 16:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We aim to determine\nconsistent projection factors that include the dynamical structure of the\nCepheids' atmosphere. Methods. Hydrodynamical models of delta Cep and l Car\nhave been used to validate a spectroscopic method of determining the projection\nfactor. This method, based on the amplitude of the radial velocity curve, is\napplied to eight stars observed with the HARPS spectrometer. The projection\nfactor is divided into three sub-concepts : (1) a geometrical effect, (2) the\nvelocity gradient within the atmosphere, and (3) the relative motion of the\n\"optical\" pulsating photosphere compared to the corresponding mass elements\n(hereafter fo-g). Both, (1) and (3) are deduced from geometrical and\nhydrodynamical models, respectively, while (2) is derived directly from\nobservations. The Fe I 4896.439 A line is found to be the best one to use in\nthe context of IBW and SB methods. A coherent and consistent period-projection\nfactor relation (hereafter Pp relation) is derived for this specific spectral\nline: p = [0.064 +- 0.020] log P + [1.376 +- 0.023].

We observed nine\ngalactic Cepheids with the HARPS spectroscope, focusing specifically on 17\nspectral lines. For each spectral line of each star, we computed the\ngamma-velocity (resp. gamma-asymmetry) as an average value of the interpolated\nradial velocity (resp. line asymmetry) curve.

We also\nprovide a physical reference to the stellar gamma-velocity: it should be zero\nwhen the gamma-asymmetry is zero. Following this definition, we provide very\nprecise and physically calibrated estimates of the gamma-velocities for all\nstars of our sample. To understand this very subtle gamma-asymmetry effect,\nfurther numerical studies are needed.

In low\ncollisionality plasmas, the Bondi spherical accretion solution is unstable to\nthe magnetothermal instability (MTI). The MTI grows rapidly at large radii\nwhere the inflow is subsonic. For a weak initial field, the MTI saturates by\ncreating a primarily radial magnetic field, i.e., by aligning the field lines\nwith the background temperature gradient. The saturation is quasilinear in the\nsense that the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of $\\sim 10-30$\nindependent of the initial field strength (for weak fields). In the saturated\nstate, the conductive heat flux is much larger than the convective heat flux,\nand is comparable to the field-free (Spitzer) value (since the field lines are\nlargely radial). The MTI by itself does not appreciably change the accretion\nrate $\\dot M$ relative to the Bondi rate $\\dot M_B$. However, the radial field\nlines created by the MTI are amplified by flux freezing as the plasma flows in\nto small radii. Oppositely directed field lines are brought together by the\nconverging inflow, leading to significant resistive heating. When the magnetic\nenergy density is comparable to the gravitational potential energy density, the\nplasma is heated to roughly the virial temperature; the mean inflow is highly\nsubsonic; most of the energy released by accretion is transported to large\nradii by thermal conduction; and the accretion rate $\\dot M \\ll \\dot M_B$.

This behavior is supported by our\nobservations and analysis, but timescales are expected to be longer than the\none observed here.

The universal appeal of the\nentanglement entropy concept is related, in part, to the fact that it is\ndefined solely in terms of the many-body density matrix of the system, with no\nrelation to any particular observables.

A wiretap channel with a helping interferer (WT-HI), in which\na transmitter sends a confidential message to its intended receiver in the\npresence of a passive eavesdropper, and with the help of an independent\ninterferer, is considered. The interferer, which does not know the confidential\nmessage, helps in ensuring the secrecy of the message by sending independent\nsignals. An achievable secrecy rate for the WT-HI is given. The results show\nthat interference can be exploited to assist secrecy in wireless\ncommunications. An important example of the Gaussian case, in which the\ninterferer has a better channel to the intended receiver than to the\neavesdropper, is considered. In this situation, the interferer can send a\n(random) codeword at a rate that ensures that it can be decoded and subtracted\nfrom the received signal by the intended receiver but cannot be decoded by the\neavesdropper.

Secondly, an alternative kernelization framework\ncalled \"KPCA trick\" is presented. Implementing a learner in the new framework\ngains several advantages over the standard framework, e.g. no mathematical\nformulas and no reprogramming are required for a kernel implementation, the\nframework avoids troublesome problems such as singularity, etc. Thirdly, while\nthe truths of representer theorems are just assumptions in previous papers\nrelated to ours, here, representer theorems are formally proven. The proofs\nvalidate both the kernel trick and the KPCA trick in the context of Mahalanobis\ndistance learning.

We recently reported a revealing reinterpretation of\nthe condensed phase Boson-Fermion Model (BFM) by comparing it to a cold atom\nformulation [1]. While the ground and singly excited states appear to remain\ncontinuous in all models we have examined, the collective modes contain a\nsingularity due to a Feshbach resonance (tuned by doping) causing a breakdown\nof the Migdal theorem. As a result of vertex corrections, there is a\nfundamental change in the nature of the superconductivity due to the formation\nof preformed pairs as the previously suggested location [1] of a quantum\ncritical point in the fulleride phase diagram is passed. The result is a\nquantum phase transition (QPT) between BCS and BEC-like (or Feshbach resonance)\nsuperconductivity (SC).\n  We discuss features of the resonance and the role of the experimentally\nobserved preformed pair formation in fullerides, essential to the Boson-Fermion\nModel (BFM), and often speculated since the work of Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink\n[17]. Here, we present arguments to establish a model of the preformed pair\nwhich can be favorably compared to a circular charge density wave (CDW)\nisolated on a fulleride molecule. The binding is much larger than a Cooper\npair. The CDW seems to be stabalized by splitting of the Jahn-Teller active\nvibrational modes to reduce Coulomb repulsions. Our conclusions are: 1) the\ndoping of two electrons into triply degenerate orbitals results in the\nexperimentally observed singlet state (CDW); and 2) this CDW (preformed pair)\nhas a dual role as doping is varied: suppression of BCS SC and enabling a\nFeshbach resonance form of SC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2008 11:21:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 14:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-28"}

On the other hand, in the\nfemtosecond mode the fluorescence spectra depend on the laser fluence, and the\nchanges are reversible: low energy fluorescence spectra are restored\nimmediately when the laser energy decreases. This effect can be explained by a\nmaterial bleaching, which favors a bulk centers emission. The ablation\nthreshold has been determined as 78 mJ/cm2 in the femtosecond laser operational\nmode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2008 13:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-11"}

After a brief theoretical introduction\n(based on the standard postulates of Special Relativity, and therefore\nextending it --or rather non-restricting it-- without any violations: for\nexample, without any violations of the so-called Einstein causality), the main\naim of this article is an updated presentation of the status-of-the-art of the\n\"superluminal\" experiments. In particular, we devote such a review to the\nphenomena met in tunneling through quantum (and classical) barriers [e.g.,\nreferring to the Genelalized Hartman Effect]; and in connection with the\n\"Localized (nondiffracting) Solutions\" of the wave equantions [e.g., of Maxwell\nequations]: especially of the \"X-shaped\" ones.\n  The interested reader is provided with an extended Bibliography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2008 15:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-10"}

The cumulative distribution of the size of the relaxations is\nanalytically computed and behaves as a power law with an exponent equal to -1.\nThis coincides with the phenomenological Gutenberg-Richter behavior observed in\nSeismology for the cumulative statistics of earthquakes at the regional or\nglobal scale. The key point of the model is the zero-load state of the system\nafter the occurrence of any relaxation, no matter what its size. This leads to\nan equipartition of probability between all possible load configurations in the\nsystem during the successive loading cycles. Each cycle ends with the\noccurrence of the greatest -or characteristic- relaxation in the system. The\nduration of the cycles in the model is statistically distributed with a\ncoefficient of variation ranging from 0.5 to 1. The predictability of the\ncharacteristic relaxations is evaluated by means of error diagrams. This model\nillustrates the value of taking into account the refractory periods to obtain a\nconsiderable gain in the quality of the predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2008 15:30:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2008 10:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-20"}
