Here we report on a measurement of the SN Ia DTD in a delay time range\nof t_Ia = 0.1-8.0 Gyr by using the faint variable objects detected in the\nSubaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS) down to i' ~ 25.5. We select 65 SN\ncandidates showing significant spatial offset from nuclei of the host galaxies\nhaving old stellar population at z ~ 0.4-1.2, out of more than 1,000 SXDS\nvariable objects. Although spectroscopic type classification is not available\nfor these, we quantitatively demonstrate that more than ~80% of these should be\nSNe Ia. The DTD is derived using the stellar age estimates of the old galaxies\nbased on 9 band photometries from optical to mid-infrared wavelength. Combined\nwith the observed SN Ia rate in elliptical galaxies at the local universe, the\nDTD in t_Ia ~ 0.1-10 Gyr is well described by a featureless power-law as\nf_D(t_Ia) \\propto t_Ia^{-1}. The derived DTD is in excellent agreement with the\ngeneric prediction of the double-degenerate scenario, giving a strong support\nto this scenario. In the single-degenerate (SD) scenario, although predictions\nby simple analytic formulations have broad DTD shapes that are similar to the\nobservation, DTD shapes calculated by more detailed binary population synthesis\ntend to have strong peaks at characteristic time scales, which do not fit the\nobservation. This result thus indicates either that the SD channel is not the\nmajor contributor to SNe Ia in old stellar population, or that improvement of\nbinary population synthesis theory is required. Various sources of systematic\nuncertainties are examined and tested, but our main conclusions are not\naffected significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2008 11:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2008 14:57:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 15:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this framework, the conformance relation is\nbased on the satisfaction of axioms. This makes it possible to formally state\nthe fundamental concepts of testing: exhaustive test set, testability\nhypotheses, oracle. Various criteria for selecting finite test sets have been\nproposed. They depend on the form of the axioms, and on the possibilities of\nobservation of the implementation under test. This last point is related to the\nwell-known oracle problem. As the main interest of algebraic specifications is\ndata type abstraction, testing a concrete implementation raises the issue of\nthe gap between the abstract description and the concrete representation. The\nobservational semantics of algebraic specifications bring solutions on the\nbasis of the so-called observable contexts. After a description of testing\nmethods based on algebraic specifications, the chapter gives a brief\npresentation of some tools and case studies, and presents some applications to\nother formal methods involving datatypes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2008 06:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Most T Tauri stars have strong\nmagnetic fields which can clear out a cavity in the innermost regions of their\ncircumstellar disks and impose magnetic induction on the nearby young planets.\nHere we consider the possibility that a magnetic coupling between young stars\nand planets could quench the planet's orbital evolution.

With an outer turbo code, the proposed detector achieves good\ncoded bit error performance as well. For example, in a 600 transmit and 600\nreceive antennas V-BLAST system with a high spectral efficiency of 200 bps/Hz\n(using BPSK and rate-1/3 turbo code), our simulation results show that the\nproposed detector performs close to within about 4.6 dB from theoretical\ncapacity.

The key difference between polytropic quark stars and the\npolytropic model studied previously for normal (i.e., non-quarkian) stars is\nrelated to two issues: (i) a constant term representing the contribution of\nvacuum energy may be added in the energy density and the pressure for a quark\nstar, but not for a normal star; (ii) the quark star models with non-vanishing\ndensity at the stellar surface are not avoidable due to the strong interaction\nbetween quarks. The first one implies that the vacuum inside a quark star is\ndifferent from that outside, while the second one is relevant to the effect of\ncolor confinement. The polytropic equations of state are stiffer than that\nderived in conventional realistic models (e.g., the bag model) for quark\nmatter, and pulsar-like stars calculated with a polytropic equation of state\ncould then have high maximum masses (> 2 M_sun). Quark stars can also be very\nlow massive, and be still gravitationally stable even if the polytropic index,\nn, is greater than 3. All these would result in different mass-radius\nrelations, which could be tested by observations. In addition, substantial\nstrain energy would develop in a solid quark star during its accretion/spindown\nphase, and could be high enough to take a star-quake.

We\npropose a simple model for a DNA inversion switch in which recombinase\nproduction is dependent on the switch state (orientational control). Our model\nis inspired by the fim switch in Escherichia coli. We present an exact\nanalytical solution of the chemical master equation for the model switch, as\nwell as stochastic simulations. Orientational control causes the switch to\ndeviate from Poissonian behaviour: the distribution of times in the on state\nshows a peak and successive flip times are correlated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2008 15:28:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2008 15:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-12"}

The interest lies in the fact that the eigenvectors can be interpreted\nas the latent components of any time series that the filter smooths through the\ncorresponding eigenvalues. A difficulty arises because matrices associated with\ntrend filters are finite approximations of Toeplitz operators and therefore\nvery little is known about their eigenstructure, which also depends on the\nboundary conditions or, equivalently, on the filters for trend estimation at\nthe end of the sample. Assuming reflecting boundary conditions, we derive a\ntime series decomposition in terms of periodic latent components and\ncorresponding smoothing eigenvalues. This decomposition depends on the local\npolynomial regression estimator chosen for the interior. Otherwise, the\neigenvalue distribution is derived with an approximation measured by the size\nof the perturbation that different boundary conditions apport to the\neigenvalues of matrices belonging to algebras with known spectral properties,\nsuch as the Circulant or the Cosine. The analytical form of the eigenvectors is\nthen derived with an approximation that involves the extremes only. A further\ntopic investigated in the paper concerns a strategy for a filter design in the\ntime domain. Based on cut-off eigenvalues, new estimators are derived, that are\nless variable and almost equally biased as the original estimator, based on all\nthe eigenvalues. Empirical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2008 14:31:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 May 2008 15:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

In this work the approximate expressions we use are based on the\nhigh-density limit of the homogeneous electron gas. Self-interaction is\nexcluded from the two-body functional itself.

If quantum\nprotocols pi_1,...,pi_k securely implement ideal functionalities F_1,...,F_k\naccording to our security definition, then any purely classical two-party\nprotocol, which makes sequential calls to F_1,...,F_k, is equally secure as the\nprotocol obtained by replacing the calls to F_1,...,F_k with the respective\nquantum protocols pi_1,...,pi_k. Hence, our approach yields the minimal\nsecurity requirements which are strong enough for the typical use of quantum\nprotocols as subroutines within larger classical schemes.
