In\ndense cores, the quantity T^{3/2}n^{-1/2} that appears in M_J scales with core\ndensity as n^{0.25} or with radiation density as U^{0.1} at the density where\ndust and gas come into thermal equilibrium.

This is considered here within a quantum\ncosmological framework in presence of a free scalar field with, in turn, a\nnegative cosmological constant and spatial curvature. Effective equations shed\nlight on the quantum dynamics around a recollapsing phase and the evolution of\nstate parameters such as fluctuations and correlations through such a turn\naround. In the models considered here, the squeezing of an initial state is\nfound to be strictly monotonic in time during the expansion, turn around and\ncontraction phases. The presence of such monotonicity is of potential\nimportance in relation to a long standing intensive debate concerning the\n(a)symmetry between the expanding and contracting phases in a recollapsing\nuniverse. Furthermore, together with recent analogous results concerning a\nbounce one can extend this monotonicity throughout an entire cycle. This\nprovides a strong motivation for employing the degree of squeezing as an\nalternative measure of (quantum) entropy. It may also serve as a new concept of\nemergent time described by a variable without classical analog. The evolution\nof the squeezing in emergent oscillating scenarios can in principle provide\nconstraints on the viability of such models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2008 18:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Then, by\nreconstructing dQ(z)/dz from observational data and comparing it with zero we\ncan assess the consistency between data and the models under consideration. For\na category of models that passes the test, we can further constrain the\ndistinct parameter of those models by reconstructing Q(z) from data. For\ndemonstration, in this paper we concentrate on quintessence. In particular we\nexamine the exponential potential and the power-law potential via a widely used\nparametrization of the dark energy equation of state, w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z),\nfor data analysis. This method of the consistency test is particularly\nefficient because for all models we invoke the constraint of only a single\nparameter space that by choice can be easily accessed.

Galactic winds, chemical\nenrichment, UV background heating and radiative cooling are taken into account\nin this very high resolution simulation. Using accretion--weighted temperature\nhistograms, we have perfomed two different measurements of the thermal state of\nthe gas accreted towards the central galaxy. The first measurement, performed\nusing accretion--weighted histograms on a spherical surface of radius 0.2 Rvir\ncentred on the densest gas structure near the halo centre of mass, is a good\nindicator of the presence of an accretion shock in the vicinity of the galactic\ndisc. We define the hot shock mass, Mshock, as the typical halo mass separating\ncold dominated from hot dominated accretion in the vicinity of the galaxy. The\nsecond measurement is performed by radially averaging histograms between 0.2\nRvir and Rvir, in order to detect radially extended structures such as gas\nfilaments: this is a good proxy for detecting cold streams feeding the central\ngalaxy. We define Mstream as the transition mass separating cold dominated from\nhot dominated accretion in the outer halo, marking the disappearance of these\ncold streams. We find a hot shock transition mass of Mshock=10^{11.6} Msun\n(dark matter), with no significant evolution with redshift. Conversely, we find\nthat Mstream increases sharply with z.

SN2006tf is valuable because it provides a link between two regimes:\n(1) luminous type IIn supernovae powered by emission directly from interaction\nwith circumstellar material (CSM), and (2) the most extremely luminous SNe\nwhere the CSM interaction is so optically thick that energy must diffuse out\nfrom an opaque shocked shell. As SN2006tf evolves, it slowly transitions from\nthe second to the first regime as the clumpy shell becomes more porous. This\nlink suggests that the range in properties of the most luminous SNe is largely\ndetermined by the density and speed of H-rich material ejected shortly before\nthey explode. The total energy radiated by SN2006tf was at least 7e50 ergs. If\nthe bulk of this luminosity came from the thermalization of shock kinetic\nenergy, then the star needs to have ejected ~18 Msun in the 4-8 yr before core\ncollapse, and another 2-6 Msun in the decades before that. A Type Ia explosion\nis therefore excluded. From the H-alpha emission-line profile, we derive a\nblast-wave speed of 2,000 km/s that does not decelerate, and from the narrow P\nCygni absorption from pre-shock gas we deduce that the progenitor's wind speed\nwas ~190 km/s. This is reminiscent of the wind speeds of LBVs, but not of RSGs\nor WR stars.

In particular, atmospheric turbulence\ncauses random fluctuations in the irradiance of the received laser beam,\ncommonly referred to as scintillation. The scintillation process is slow\ncompared to the large data rates typical of optical transmission. As such, we\nadopt a quasi-static block fading model and study the outage probability of the\nchannel under the assumption of orthogonal pulse-position modulation. We\ninvestigate the mitigation of scintillation through the use of multiple lasers\nand multiple apertures, thereby creating a multiple-input multiple output\n(MIMO) channel. Non-ideal photodetection is also assumed such that the combined\nshot noise and thermal noise are considered as signal-independent Additive\nGaussian white noise. Assuming perfect receiver channel state information\n(CSI), we compute the signal-to-noise ratio exponents for the cases when the\nscintillation is lognormal, exponential and gamma-gamma distributed, which\ncover a wide range of atmospheric turbulence conditions. Furthermore, we\nillustrate very large gains, in some cases larger than 15 dB, when transmitter\nCSI is also available by adapting the transmitted electrical power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2008 00:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-02"}

Both mean flows are linearly\nunstable for a range of supersonic Mach numbers ($M$). For a given $M$, the\ncritical Reynolds number ($Re$) is significantly smaller for the uniform shear\nflow than its non-uniform shear counterpart.

However, because of\nthe required mass assignment onto grid points in this method, the measured\npower spectrum $\\la |\\delta^f(k)|^2\\ra$ obtained with an FFT is not the true\npower spectrum $P(k)$ but instead one that is convolved with a window function\n$|W(\\vec k)|^2$ in Fourier space.

Our tests using data from the Millennium Simulation show that the true\npower spectrum of dark matter can be accurately measured at a level better than\n2% up to $k=0.7k_N$, without applying any deconvolution processes.

Here we present a theory of the phase\nsensitivity for the general case where the detection probability is given by an\n$N$ photon interference fringe. We find that the phase sensitivity has a\ncomplex dependence on both the intrinsic efficiency of detection $\\eta$ and the\ninterference fringe visibility $V$. Most importantly, the phase that gives\nmaximum phase sensitivity is in general not the same as the phase at which the\nslope of the interference fringe is a maximum, as has previously been assumed.\nWe determine the parameter range where quantum enhanced sensitivity can be\nachieved. In order to illustrate these theoretical results, we perform a four\nphoton experiment with $\\eta=3/4$ and $V=82\\pm6$% (an extension of our previous\nwork [Science \\textbf{316}, 726 (2007)]) and find a phase sensitivity 1.3 times\ngreater than the standard quantum limit at a phase different to that which\ngives maximum slope of the interference fringe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2008 07:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Therefore,\nthe relation presented here between equilibrium fluctuations and response can\nhave a very different physical nature from the usual one in the canonical\nensemble. These considerations imply that the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem\nis not restricted to the context of thermal equilibrium, where it is usually\nderived.

Velocity and\nacceleration information cannot be extracted directly since the noise in the\nNGSIM positional information is greatly increased by the necessary numerical\ndifferentiations. We propose a smoothing algorithm for positions, velocities\nand accelerations that can also be applied near the boundaries. The smoothing\ntime interval is estimated based on velocity time series and the variance of\nthe processed acceleration time series. The velocity information obtained in\nthis way is then applied to calculate the density function of the\ntwo-dimensional distribution of velocity and inverse distance, and the density\nof the distribution corresponding to the ``microscopic'' fundamental diagram.\nFurthermore, it is used to calculate the distributions of time gaps and\ntimes-to-collision, conditioned to several ranges of velocities and velocity\ndifferences. By simulating virtual stationary detectors we show that the\nprobability for critical values of the times-to-collision is greatly\nunderestimated when estimated from single-vehicle data of stationary detectors.\nFinally, we investigate the lane-changing process and formulate a quantitative\ncriterion for the duration of lane changes that is based on the trajectory\ndensity in normalized coordinates. Remarkably, there is a very noisy but\nsignificant velocity advantage in favor of the targeted lane that decreases\nimmediately before the change due to anticipatory accelerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2008 08:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-13"}

The comparison of the radio continuum power with a comparable sample,\nwhich is however not selected with respect to its environment, the Condon et\nal. UGC-SF sample of star-forming field galaxies, shows a lower mean value for\nthe AMIGA sample. We have obtained radio-to-optical flux ratios (R) using the\nNVSS radio continuum flux. The distribution of R for the AMIGA galaxies is\nconsistent with a sample dominated by radio emission from star formation (SF)\nand a small number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), with less than 3% of the\nsample with R > 100. We derived the radio luminosity function (RLF) and total\npower density of the radio continuum emission for the AMIGA sample at 1.4 GHz,\nand compared them with results from other low redshift studies. The Schechter\nfit of the RLF indicates a major weight of the low-luminosity galaxies. The\nresults indicate the very low level of radio continuum emission in our sample\nof isolated galaxies, which is dominated by mild disk SF. It confirms hence the\nAMIGA sample as a suitable template to effectively quantify the role of\ninteractions in samples extracted from denser environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2008 10:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Even the existing standards of VoIP provide an\nassurance of security and Quality of Service (QoS), however, these features are\nusually optional and supported by limited number of implementations. As a\nresult, the lack of mandatory and widely applicable QoS and security guaranties\nmakes the contemporary VoIP systems vulnerable to attacks and network\ndisturbances. In this paper we are facing these issues and propose the SecMon\nsystem, which simultaneously provides a lightweight security mechanism and\nimproves quality parameters of the call. SecMon is intended specially for VoIP\nservice over P2P networks and its main advantage is that it provides\nauthentication, data integrity services, adaptive QoS and (D)DoS attack\ndetection. Moreover, the SecMon approach represents a low-bandwidth consumption\nsolution that is transparent to the users and possesses a self-organizing\ncapability. The above-mentioned features are accomplished mainly by utilizing\ntwo information hiding techniques: digital audio watermarking and network\nsteganography. These techniques are used to create covert channels that serve\nas transport channels for lightweight QoS measurement's results. Furthermore,\nthese metrics are aggregated in a reputation system that enables best route\npath selection in the P2P network.

Several statistical\nissues related to this model are studied. We first make a quick but extensive\nreview of their main properties and show that most of these properties can be\nanalytically studied. We then develop an approximation theory of these\nprocesses in the limit of small intermittency $\\lambda^2\\ll 1$, i.e., when the\ndegree of multifractality is small. This allows us to prove that the\nprobability distributions associated with these processes possess some very\nsimple aggregation properties accross time scales. Such a control of the\nprocess properties at different time scales, allows us to address the problem\nof parameter estimation. We show that one has to distinguish two different\nasymptotic regimes: the first one, referred to as the ''low frequency regime'',\ncorresponds to taking a sample whose overall size increases whereas the second\none, referred to as the ''high frequency regime'', corresponds to sampling the\nprocess at an increasing sampling rate. We show that, the first regime leads to\nconvergent estimators whereas, in the high frequency regime, the situation is\nmuch more intricate : only the intermittency coefficient $\\lambda^2$ can be\nestimated using a consistent estimator. However, we show that, in practical\nsituations, one can detect the nature of the asymptotic regime (low frequency\nversus high frequency) and consequently decide whether the estimations of the\nother parameters are reliable or not. We finally illustrate how both our\nresults on parameter estimation and on aggregation properties, allow one to\nsuccessfully use these models for modelization and prediction of financial time\nseries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2008 14:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

Condensation in such models is exhibited when above a critical\nmass density the marginal distribution for the mass at a single site develops a\nbump, $p_{\\rm cond}(m)$, at large mass $m$. This bump corresponds to a\ncondensate site carrying a finite fraction of the mass in the system. Here, we\nstudy the condensation transition from a different aspect, that of extreme\nvalue statistics. We consider the cumulative distribution of the largest mass\nin the system and compute its asymptotic behaviour. We show 3 distinct\nbehaviours: at subcritical densities the distribution is Gumbel; at the\ncritical density the distribution is Fr\\'echet, and above the critical density\na different distribution emerges. We relate $p_{\\rm cond}(m)$ to the\nprobability density of the largest mass in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2008 15:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-25"}

This decrement is located in the\ndirection of the Corona Borealis supercluster, at a position with no known\ngalaxy clusters, and was discovered by a previous VSA survey (Genova-Santos et\nal.). A total area of 3 sq.deg. has now been imaged, with an angular resolution\nof 7 arcmin and a flux sensitivity of 5 mJy/beam.\n  These observations confirm the presence of this strong and resolved negative\nspot at -41+/-5 mJy/beam (-258+/-29 muK), with a signal to noise level of 8.\nThis structure is also present in the WMAP 5-year data. The temperature of the\nW-band (94 GHz) data at the position of the decrement agrees within 1.2-sigma\nwith that observed by the VSA at 33 GHz, and within 0.2-sigma with the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) spectrum.\n  Our analyses show that it is a non-Gaussian feature in the CMB at a level of\n4.8-sigma. The probability of finding such a deviation or larger in CMB\nGaussian simulations is only 0.19 per cent. Therefore, an explanation other\nthan primordial CMB is required. We have considered the possibility of an SZ\neffect generated in a diffuse, extended warm/hot gas distribution. This\nhypothesis is especially relevant, as the presence of such structures, if\nconfirmed, could provide the location for a significant fraction of the missing\nbaryons in the Local Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2008 15:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Using a model containing two\ntypes of local U(1) string and stable composites, we simulate the collision of\ntwo straight strings and investigate whether the dynamics matches that\npreviously obtained using the Nambu-Goto action, which is not strictly valid\nclose to the junction. We find that the Nambu-Goto action performs only\nmoderately well at predicting when the collision results in the formation of a\npair of Y-junctions (with a composite string connecting them). However, we find\nthat when they do form, the late time dynamics matches those of the Nambu-Goto\napproximation very closely.
