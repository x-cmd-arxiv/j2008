Given that\norder flow is highly autocorrelated, this premise requires that market impact\n(1) depends on past order flow and (2) is asymmetric for buying and selling.

We present new high spatial resolution narrowband imaging\nobservations of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) in four late-type,\nactively star forming edge-on spirals, obtained with ACS on-board HST. Our\nF658N (H-alpha) observations reveal a multitude of structures on both small and\nlarge scales. Whereas all four galaxies have been studied with ground-based\ntelescopes before, here the small scale structure of the extended emission line\ngas is presented for the first time at a spatial resolution of 0.05\",\ncorresponding to 5.0 pc at the mean distance to the target galaxies. The eDIG\nmorphology is very different for all four targets, probably as a result of\ntheir different levels of star formation activity. We find that the morphology\nof the eDIG, in particular the break-up of diffuse emission into filaments in\ngalaxy halos, shows a strong dependence on the level of star formation activity\nper unit area, and eDIG can be arranged into a morphological sequence. NGC4634\nand NGC5775 have the highest SF rate per unit area in our sample and the\nobserved morphology suggests that the break-up of the smooth eDIG layer into\nindividual resolved filaments occurs only above a certain threshold of SF\nactivity per unit area.

Whether and how these two phenomena are interdependent is\nperhaps most sharply seen in the stripe phases of various copper-oxide\nmaterials. These phases, involving a mixture of spin and charge density waves,\ndo not yet admit a complete, overarching theoretical treatment. However aspects\nof this problem can be analyzed. In this work, we focus on the magnetic side of\nstripe physics. To this end, we study a simple model of a stripe-ordered phase\nconsisting of an array of alternating coupled doped and undoped two-leg\nHubbard-like ladders. To obtain the magnetic response, we employ already\navailable dynamical susceptibilities of the individual two-leg ladders and\ntreat the interladder coupling in a random phase approximation. Strikingly, we\nfind two possible scenarios for the ordered state induced by the coupling\nbetween ladders: the spin modulation can occur either along or perpendicular to\nthe direction of the stripes. These two scenarios are differentiated according\nto different microscopic realizations of the component doped ladders. However\ninelastic neutron scattering experiments on the two stripe ordered cuprates,\nLa_{1.875}Ba_{0.125}CuO_4 and La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4, do not readily distinguish\nbetween these two scenarios due to manner in which stripes form in these\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2008 03:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Using both large $S$ and large $N$\nmethods, we show that this model exhibits a sequence of two phase transitions:\nfrom a high temperature symmetric phase to a narrow region of intermediate\n``nematic'' phase, and then to a low temperature spin ordered phase.\nIdentifying phases by their broken symmetries, these phases correspond\nprecisely to the sequence of structural (tetragonal to monoclinic) and magnetic\ntransitions that have been recently revealed in neutron scattering studies of\nLaOFeAs. The structural transition can thus be identified with the existence of\nincipient (``fluctuating'') magnetic order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2008 15:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The resulting increase of the\nentropy can be counterbalanced by a suitable retuning of the initial\ntemperature. An increase of the transverse collective flow is observed. The\ninfluence of the shear viscosity on the longitudinal expansion is also studied.\nViscosity reduces the cooling rate from the longitudinal work and counteracts\nthe pressure gradients that accelerate the longitudinal flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2008 15:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
