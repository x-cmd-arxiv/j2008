Such a guide is suitable for transporting particles\nthat are attracted to strong electric fields, which cannot be guided using\nstatic fields. Particles are only transmitted if their initial positions and\ntransverse speeds lie within the guide's phase space acceptance. Nonlinear\nforces are always present in the guide and can severely reduce this acceptance.\nWe consider the effects of the two most important nonlinear forces, a term in\nthe force that is cubic in the off-axis displacement, and a nonlinear term\nwhich couples together the two transverse motions. We use approximate\nanalytical techniques, along with numerical methods, to calculate the influence\nof these nonlinear forces on the particle trajectories and on the phase space\nacceptance. The cubic term alters the focussing and defocussing powers, leading\neither to an increase or a decrease of the acceptance depending on its sign. We\nfind an approximate analytical result for the phase space acceptance including\nthis cubic term. Using a perturbation method we show how the coupling term\nleads to slow changes in the amplitudes of the transverse oscillations. This\nterm reduces the acceptance when it reduces the focussing power, but has little\ninfluence when it increases that power. It is not possible to eliminate both\nnonlinear terms, but one can be made small at the expense of the other. We show\nhow to choose the guide parameters so that the acceptance is optimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Apr 2008 17:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-22"}

Methods: 2.5D numerical\nsimulations of the chromosphere were conducted using a newly developed\ntwo-fluid (ion-neutral) numerical code. Developed from the Artificial Wind\nscheme, the numerical code includes the effects of ion-neutral collisions,\nionization/recombination, thermal/resistive diffusivity and\ncollisional/resistive heating. Results: It was found that the rates of magnetic\nreconnection strongly depend on the neutral-hydrogen to proton density ratio;\nincreasing the density ratio by a thousand-fold decreased the rate of magnetic\nreconnection by twenty-fold. This result implies that magnetic reconnection\nproceeds significantly faster in the upper chromosphere, where the density of\nions (protons) and neutral-hydrogen is comparable, than in the lower\nchromosphere where the density of neutral-hydrogen is over a thousand times the\nion density. The inclusion of ionization/recombination, an important physics\neffect in the chromosphere, increases the total reconnected magnetic flux, but\ndoes not alter the rate of magnetic reconnection. Reductions in the ion-neutral\ncollision frequency, result in small increases to the rates of magnetic\nreconnection.

The stars show E(B-V) = 1.11\nand spectral types near O9.5V and B0.5III. A catalog is presented of 380\ndiffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) measured between 3900 and 8100 A in the\nstars' spectrum. The central wavelengths, the widths (FWHM), and the equivalent\nwidths of nearly all of the bands are tabulated, along with the minimum\nuncertainties in the latter. The reliable removal of very weak stellar lines\nfrom the catalog, and of some stellar lines from the less severe blends with\nDIBs, is made generally easy by the highly variable radial velocities of both\nstars. The principal result of this investigation is that the great majority of\nthe bands in the catalog are very weak and relatively narrow. Typical\nequivalent widths amount to a few mA, and the band widths (FWHM) are most often\nnear 0.55 A. Therefore, most of these DIBs can be detected only in spectra\nobtained at a resolving power and a S/N ratio at least comparable to those used\nhere. In addition, the anomalous interstellar reddening and the very high value\nof the ratio N(C2)/E(B-V) seen toward HD 204827 indicate that the physical\nconditions in one or more of the several interstellar clouds seen in this\ndirection differ significantly from those found toward the prototypical DIB\ntarget HD 183143, for example.

Very\nrecently, pore network modelling has been applied to model the gas diffusion\nlayer (GDL) of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. Discrete pore\nnetwork models have the potential to elucidate transport phenomena in the GDL\nwith high computational efficiency, in contrast to continuum or molecular\ndynamics modelling that require extensive computational resources.

It is worth noting that in game theoretic settings many\nstandard techniques, such as randomized rounding, violate certain monotonicity\nproperties, which are imperative for truthfulness, and therefore cannot be\nemployed. In light of this state of affairs, we design a monotone deterministic\nalgorithm, which is based on a primal-dual machinery, which attains an\napproximation ratio of $\\frac{e}{e-1}$, up to a disparity of $\\epsilon$ away.\nThis implies an improvement on the current best truthful mechanism, as well as\nan improvement on the current best combinatorial algorithm for the problem\nunder consideration.

These data are combined with photometry\nfrom Aragon-Salamanca et al. (1998) and a low-redshift comparison sample from\nvon der Linden et al. (2007). The K-band Hubble diagram for BCGs exhibits very\nlow scatter (~0.35mag) since z=1. The colour and $K$-band luminosity evolution\nof the BCGs are in good agreement with passively-evolving stellar populations\nformed at z>2. We do not detect any significant change in the stellar mass of\nthe BCG since z~1. These results do not seem to depend on the velocity\ndispersion of the parent cluster. There is a correlation between the 1D\nvelocity dispersion of the clusters and the K-band luminosity of the BCGs\n(after correcting for passive evolution). The clusters with large velocity\ndispersions tend to have brighter BCGs, i.e., BCGs with larger stellar masses.\nThis dependency, although significant, is relatively weak: the stellar mass of\nthe BCGs changes only by ~70% over a two-order-of-magnitude range in cluster\nmass. This dependency doesn't change significantly with redshift. The models of\nDe Lucia & Blaizot (2007) predict colours which are in reasonable agreement\nwith the observations because the growth in stellar mass is dominated by the\naccretion of old stars. However, the stellar mass in the model BCGs grows by a\nfactor of 3-4 since z=1, a growth rate which seems to be ruled out by the\nobservations. The models predict a dependency between the BCG's stellar mass\nand the velocity dispersion of the parent cluster in the same sense as the\ndata, but the dependency is significantly stronger than observed. However, one\nmajor difficulty in this comparison is that we have measured fixed metric\naperture magnitudes while the models compute total luminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2008 11:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is inspired by\nGuillen-Navarros's '(cubical) descent categories'. The key ingredients in a\n(co)simplicial descent category D are a class E of morphisms in D, called\nequivalences, and a 'simple' functor s : {(co)simplicial objects in D} -> D.\nThey must satisfy axioms like 'Eilenberg-Zilber', 'exactness' and 'acyclicity'.\nThis notion covers a wide class of examples, as chain complexes, sSets,\ntopological spaces, filtered cochain complexes (where E = filtered\nquasi-isomorphisms or E = E_2-isomorphisms), commutative differential graded\nalgebras (with s = Navarro's Thom-Whitney simple), DG-modules over a\nDG-category and mixed Hodge complexes, where s = Deligne's simple. From the\nsimplicial descent structure we obtain homotopical structure on D, as cone and\ncylinder objects. We use them to i) explicitly describe the morphisms of\nHoD=D[E^{-1}] similarly to the case of calculus of fractions; ii) endow HoD\nwith a non-additive pre-triangulated structure, that becomes triangulated in\nthe stable additive case. These results use the properties of a 'total\nfunctor', which associates to any biaugmented bisimplicial object a simplicial\nobject. It is the simplicial analogue of the total chain complex of a double\ncomplex, and it is left adjoint to Illusie's 'decalage' functor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2008 14:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-15"}

We find that the well-known $t^{-(2+\\beta)}$\ncurve is present only when the intrinsic emission is extremely short or the\nemission arises from an exponential cooling. The time scale of this curve is\nindependent of the Lorentz factor. The resulting light curve would contain two\nphases when the intrinsic emission has a power-law spectrum and a temporal\npower-law profile with infinite duration. The first phase is a rapid decay one\nwhere the light curve well follows the $t^{-(2+\\beta)}$ curve. The second is a\nshallow decay phase where the power-law index of the light curve is obviously\nsmaller than that in the first phase. The start of the shallow phase is\nstrictly constrained by the fireball radius, which in turn, can put a lower\nlimit to the latter. In the case when the temporal power-law emission lasts a\nlimited interval of time, there will be a third phase after the\n$t^{-(2+\\beta)}$ curve and the shallow decay phase, which is much steeper than\nthe shallow phase.

One basic question tackled in the work is the relation between the\nterms 'grading' and 'group grading'. Although these terms have originally been\nclaimed to coincide for simple Lie algebras, it was revealed later that the\nproof of this assertion was incorrect. Therefore, the crucial statements about\none-to-one correspondence between fine gradings and MAD-groups had to be\nrevised and re-formulated for fine group gradings instead. However, there is\nstill a hypothesis that the terms 'grading' and 'group grading' coincide for\nsimple complex Lie algebras. We use the MAD-groups as the main tool for finding\nfine group gradings of the complex Lie algebras $A_3 \\cong D_3$, $B_2 \\cong\nC_2$, and $D_2$. Besides, we develop also other methods for finding the fine\n(group) gradings. They are useful especially for the real forms of the complex\nalgebras, on which they deliver richer results than the MAD-groups. Systematic\nuse is made of the faithful representations of the three Lie algebras by\n$4\\times 4$ matrices: $A_3 = sl(4,\\mathbb C)$, $C_2 = sp(4,\\mathbb C)$, $D_2 =\no(4,\\mathbb C)$. The inclusions $sl(4,\\mathbb C)\\supset sp(4,\\mathbb C)$ and\n$sl(4,\\mathbb C) \\supset o(4,\\mathbb C)$ are important in our presentation,\nsince they allow to employ one of the methods which considerably simplifies the\ncalculations when finding the fine group gradings of the subalgebras\n$sp(4,\\mathbb C)$ and $o(4,\\mathbb C)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2008 15:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-15"}

Electrons trapped in a formerly bound state\nwill tunnel off the surface of helium; we show that under suitable\ncircumstances this ``radioactive decay'' can show damped oscillations rather\nthan a simple exponential decay.

The approximation parameters, which can be\nretrieved from simulations, point to the necessity of additional information in\norder to fully describe the correlation effects apart from merely the fraction\nof ion-pairs which apparently accounts for the correlations originating from\nonly the nearest neighbor structural correlations. These parameters are close\nto but not exactly unity as assumed in the SO model. Finally, as an application\nof the extended SO model one is able to estimate the dynamics of the free and\nnon-free ions as well as their fractions from the knowledge of the single\nparticle diffusivities and the collective diffusivity of the ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2008 15:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-15"}

A strong\ninteraction is found between the PNR and the propagation of sound waves, i.e.\nacoustic phonons, the visibility of which can be enhanced with an external\nelectric field. A comparison between acoustic phonons propagating along\ndifferent directions reveals a large asymmetry in the lattice dynamics that is\ninduced by the PNR.
