High quality spectra\n(S/N>50 in the continuum near Halpha and Hbeta) were obtained in the spectral\nrange ~4000 to 7500 \\AA, with a resolution between 5 and 15 A, using the 6-m\nand the 1-m SAO's telescopes (Russia), the GHAO's 2.1-m telescope (Cananea,\nMexico), and the OAN-SPM's 2.1-m telescope (San-Pedro, Mexico). The observed\nfluxes of the Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma and HeII emission lines and of the\ncontinuum at the observed wavelength 5117 A, were corrected for the position\nangle, the seeing and the aperture effects.\n  We found that the continuum and line fluxes varied strongly (up to a factor\n6) during the monitoring period. The emission was maximum in 1996-1998, and\nthere were two minima, in 2001 and in 2005. The Halpha, Hgamma and He II fluxes\nwere well correlated with the Hbeta flux. We considered three characteristic\nperiods during which the Hbeta and Halpha profiles were similar: 1996-1999,\n2000-2001 and 2002-2006. The line to continuum flux ratios were different; in\nparticular during the first period, the lines were not correlated with the\ncontinuum and saturated at high fluxes. In the second and third period, where\nthe continuum flux was small, the Halpha and Hbeta fluxes were well correlated\nto the continuum flux, meaning that the ionizing continuum was a good\nextrapolation of the optical continuum. The CCFs are often asymmetrical and the\ntime lags between the lines and the continuum are badly defined indicating the\npresence of a complex BLR, with dimensions from 1 to 50 light-days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Apr 2008 14:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2008 08:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
