The algorithm is based on the two step,\nparametric, likelihood-based technique recently elaborated on by Eriksen et\nal., (2006), where the foreground spectral parameters are estimated prior to\nthe actual separation of the components. In contrast with the previous\napproaches, we accomplish the former task with help of an analytically-derived\nlikelihood function for the spectral parameters, which, we show, yields\nestimates equal to the maximum likelihood values of the full multi-dimensional\ndata problem. We then use these estimates to perform the second step via the\nstandard, generalized-least-square-like procedure. We demonstrate that the\nproposed approach is equivalent to a direct maximization of the full data\nlikelihood, which is recast in a computationally tractable form. We use the\ncorresponding curvature matrices to characterize statistical properties of the\nrecovered parameters. We incorporate in the formalism some of the essential\nfeatures of the CMB data sets, such as inhomogeneous pixel domain noise,\nunknown map offsets as well as calibration errors and study their consequences\nfor the separation.

These phenomena shall be described\nand exemplified by computer simulations of the Asakura-Oosawa model for\ncolloid-polymer mixtures, but applications to other soft matter systems (e.g.\nconfined polymer blends) will also be mentioned. Typically a wall will prefer\none of the phases, and hence the composition of the system in the direction\nperpendicular to the walls will not be homogeneous. If both walls are of the\nsame kind, this effect leads to a distortion of the phase diagram of the system\nin thin film geometry, in comparison with the bulk, analogous to the phenomenon\nof \"capillary condensation\" of simple fluids in thin capillaries. In the case\nof \"competing walls\", where both walls prefer different phases of the two\nphases coexisting in the bulk, a state with an interface parallel to the walls\ngets stabilized. The transition from the disordered phase to this \"soft mode\nphase\" is rounded by the finite thickness of the film and not a sharp phase\ntransition. However, a sharp transition can occur where this interface gets\nlocalized at (one of) the walls. The relation of this interface localization\ntransition to wetting phenomena is discussed. Finally, an outlook to related\nphenomena is given, such as the effects of confinement in cylindrical pores on\nthe phase behavior, and more complicated ordering phenomena (lamellar\nmesophases of block copolymers or nematic phases of liquid crystals under\nconfinement).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2008 18:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-17"}

This technique is the only\none presently available that can provide a transiting planet's orbital plane\nposition angle, and can directly determine the planet's radius independent of\nany outside observations, appearing able to improve substantially upon other\ndeterminations of that radius. Additional directly observed parameters - also\nnot dependent upon transit photometry or spectroscopy - include impact\nparameter, transit ingress time, transit velocity and stellar radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2008 20:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here the relevant waves for\n$v_b \\approx v_s$ are examined and how they interact nonlinearly with the\nparticles. The collision of two plasma clouds at the speed $v_s$ is modelled\nwith particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, which convect with them magnetic\nfields oriented perpendicular to their flow velocity vector. One simulation\nmodels equally dense clouds and the other one uses a density ratio of 2.

The symmetric\ncollision yields only short oscillatory wave pulses, while the asymmetric\ncollision also produces large-scale electric fields, probably through a\nmagnetic pressure gradient. The large-scale fields destroy the electron phase\nspace holes and they accelerate the ions, which facilitates the formation of a\nprecursor shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2008 20:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Special attention was given to effects of extra holes or electrons,\nintroduced by light doping of Co sites by Mg2+ or Ti4+ ions. The experiments on\nthe La based compounds were complemented with magnetic measurements. The study\nshows that both kinds of charge carriers induce magnetic states on surrounding\nCoIII sites and form thus thermally stable polarons of large total spin. Their\nitinerancy is characterized by low temperature resistivity, which is of\nArrhenius type r~exp(EA/kT) for the hole (CoIV) doped samples, while an unusual\ndependence r~1/Tn (n=8-10) is observed for the electron (CoII) doped samples.\nAt higher temperatures, additional hole carriers are massively populated in the\nCoIII background, leading to a resistivity drop. This transition become evident\nat ~300 K and 450 K and culminates at TI-M=540 and 780 K for the La and Dy\nbased samples, respectively.\n  The electronic behaviours of the cobaltites are explained considering two\nexcitation processes in parent compounds. The first one is related to a local\nexcitation from the diamagnetic LS CoIII to close-lying paramagnetic HS CoIII\nstate. Secondarily, a metallic phase of the IS CoIII character is formed\nthrough a charge transfer mechanism between LS/HS pairs. The magnetic polarons\nassociated with doped carriers are interpreted as droplets of such IS phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2008 21:26:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2008 09:46:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 12:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

To this end, it is important to develop rigorous diagnostic tools\nfor the physical interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations in suitably\nchosen spectral lines. Here we present a computer program for the synthesis and\ninversion of Stokes profiles caused by the joint action of atomic level\npolarization and the Hanle and Zeeman effects in some spectral lines of\ndiagnostic interest, such as those of the He I 10830 A and D_3 multiplets. It\nis based on the quantum theory of spectral line polarization, which takes into\naccount all the relevant physical mechanisms and ingredients (optical pumping,\natomic level polarization, Zeeman, Paschen-Back and Hanle effects). The\ninfluence of radiative transfer on the emergent spectral line radiation is\ntaken into account through a suitable slab model. The user can either calculate\nthe emergent intensity and polarization for any given magnetic field vector or\ninfer the dynamical and magnetic properties from the observed Stokes profiles\nvia an efficient inversion algorithm based on global optimization methods. The\nreliability of the forward modeling and inversion code presented here is\ndemonstrated through several applications, which range from the inference of\nthe magnetic field vector in solar active regions to determining whether or not\nit is canopy-like in quiet chromospheric regions. This user-friendly diagnostic\ntool called \"HAZEL\" (from HAnle and ZEeman Light) is offered to the\nastrophysical community, with the hope that it will facilitate new advances in\nsolar and stellar physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2008 22:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These artificial travel-time perturbation profiles have\nprovided us with several related but distinct observations: i) that strong\nsurface magnetic fields have a dual effect on helioseismic rays -- increasing\ntheir skip distance while at the same time speeding them up considerably\ncompared to their quiet-Sun counterparts, ii) there is a clear and significant\nfrequency dependence of both skip-distance and travel-time perturbations across\nthe simulated sunspot radius, iii) the negative sign and magnitude of these\nperturbations appears to be directly related to the sunspot magnetic-field\nstrength and inclination, iv) by ``switching off'' the magnetic field inside\nthe sunspot, we are able to completely isolate the thermal component of the\ntravel-time perturbations observed, which is seen to be both opposite in sign\nand much smaller in magnitude than those measured when the magnetic field is\npresent.

It is based on fluctuations of electric field in\nenzyme active site produced by thermally equilibrium rocking (cranckshaft\nmotion) of the rigid plane (in which the dipole moment $\\approx 3.6 D$ lies) of\na favourably located and oriented peptide group (or may be a few of them). Thus\nthe rocking of the plane leads to fluctuations of the electric field of the\ndipole moment. These fluctuations can interact with the reaction coordinate\nbecause the latter in its turn has transition dipole moment due to separation\nof charges at movement of the reacting system along it. The rocking of the\nplane of the peptide group is sensitive to the microviscosity of its\nenvironment in protein interior and the latter is a function of the solvent\nviscosity. Thus we obtain an additional factor of interrelationship for these\ncharacteristics with the reaction rate constant. We argue that due to the\nproperties of the cranckshaft motion the frequency spectrum of the electric\nfield fluctuations has a sharp resonance peak at some frequency and the\ncorresponding Fourier mode can be approximated as oscillations. We employ a\nknown result from the theory of thermally activated escape with periodic\ndriving to obtain the reaction rate constant and argue that it yields reliable\ndescription of the preexponent where the dependence on solvent viscosity\nmanifests itself.

Such an ambiguity of the choice\nof this expression from some class of functions is allowed in the framework of\nloop quantisation. Our main goal is to show how such modifications can\ninfluence the bouncing universe scenario in the loop quantum cosmology. In\neffective models considered we classify all evolutional paths for all\nadmissible initial conditions. The dynamics is reduced to the form of a\ndynamical system of the Newtonian type on a 2-dimensional phase plane. These\nmodels are equivalent dynamically to the FRW models with the decaying effective\ncosmological term parametrised by the canonical variable $p$ (or by the scale\nfactor $a$). We find that for the positive cosmological constant there is a\nclass of oscillating models without the initial and final singularities. The\nnew phenomenon is the appearance of curvature singularities for the finite\nvalues of the scale factor, but we find that for the positive cosmological\nconstant these singularities can be avoided. For the positive cosmological\nconstant the evolution begins at the asymptotic state in the past represented\nby the deSitter contracting (deS$_{-}$) spacetime or the static Einstein\nuniverse H=0 or $H=-\\infty$ state and reaches the deSitter expanding state\n(deS$_{+}$), the state H=0 or $H=+\\infty$ state.

We consider an axisymmetric plume, and model the dissolution\nby means of the Ranz-Marshall equation in which there occurs a mass transfer\ncoefficient dependent on the plume properties. Our kinetic energy approach is\nmoreover generalized so as to take into account variable slip velocities.\n  The theoretical model is compared with various experiments, and satisfactory\nagreement is found. One central ingredient in the model is the turbulent\ncorrelation parameter, called I, playing a role analogous to the conventional\nentrainment coefficient \\alpha in the more traditional plume theories. We use\nexperimental data to suggest a relationship between I, the initial gas flux at\nthe source, and the depth of the gas release. This relationship is used to make\npredictions for five distinct case studies.\n  Comparison with various experimental data shows that the kinetic energy\napproach built upon use of the parameter I in practice has the order of\npredictive power as the conventional entrainment-coefficient models. Moreover,\nan advantage of the present model is that its predictions are very quickly\nworked out numerically.\n  Finally, we give a sensitivity analysis of the kinetic energy approach.

These results agree with the\nrecent theoretical predictions [Zhou et al., PRB 75, 045305 (2007)], verifying\nthe importance of electron-electron Coulomb scattering to electron spin\nrelaxation/dephasing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2008 15:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
