The qubits are encoded in the polarizations of\nsingle photons, while the interaction with the environment is implemented by\ncoupling the polarization of each photon with its momentum. A convenient Sagnac\ninterferometer allows for the implementation of several decoherence channels\nand for the continuous monitoring of the environment. For an\ninitially-entangled photon pair, one observes the vanishing of entanglement\nbefore coherence disappears. For a single qubit interacting with an\nenvironment, the dynamics of complementarity relations connecting single-qubit\nproperties and its entanglement with the environment is experimentally\ndetermined. The evolution of a single qubit under continuous monitoring of the\nenvironment is investigated, demonstrating that a qubit may decay even when the\nenvironment is found in the unexcited state. This implies that entanglement can\nbe increased by local continuous monitoring, which is equivalent to\nentanglement distillation. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer\nof entanglement from the two-qubit system to the two corresponding\nenvironments, between which entanglement may suddenly appear, and show\ninstances for which no entanglement is created between dephasing environments,\nnor between each of them and the corresponding qubit: the initial two-qubit\nentanglement gets transformed into legitimate multiqubit entanglement of the\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2008 19:48:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 16:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

We have modelled the thin and thick discs of 4\nedge-on spirals located in Abell clusters: NGC 705, ESO243G49, ESO187G19,\nLCSBS0496P. Deep I band images of NGC 705 were taken from the HST archive,\nwhereas the remaining images were obtained with the Southern Telescope for\nAstrophysical Research (SOAR) in Gunn r filter. They reached surface brightness\nlevels of $\\mu_I \\simeq 26.0$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $\\mu_r \\simeq 26.5$ mag\narcsec$^{-2}$, respectively. Profiles were extracted from the deep images, in\ndirections both parallel and perpendicular to the major axis. Profile fits were\ncarried out at several positions, yielding horizontal and vertical scale\nparameters for both thin and thick disc components. The extracted profiles and\nfitted disc parameters vary from galaxy to galaxy. Two galaxies have a\nhorizontal profile with a strong down-turn at outer radii, preventing a simple\nexponential from fitting the entire range. For the 2 early-type spirals, the\nthick discs have larger scalelengths than the thin discs, whereas no trend is\nseen for the later types . Both the thin and thick discs sampled tend to have\nsimilar scalelengths and scaleheights when compared to typical field disc\ngalaxies. However, the thin disc parameters of the 2 farthest galaxies, both\nlate-type spirals, may be significantly affected by seeing effects. Taken at\nface value, our results suggest that environment plays a minor role in\ndetermining the thin and thick disc sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2008 16:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Comet Tuttle reveals a truly unusual\ncomposition, distinct from that of any comet observed to date at infrared\nwavelengths. The prominent enrichment of methanol relative to water contrasts\nthe depletions of other molecules, especially C2H2 and HCN. We suggest that the\nnucleus of 8P/Tuttle may contain two cometesimals characterized by distinct\nvolatile composition. The relative abundances C2/CN, C2/OH, and CN/OH in\n8P/Tuttle (measured at optical/near-UV wavelengths) differ substantially from\nthe mixing ratios of their potential parents (C2H2/HCN, C2H2/H2O, and HCN/H2O)\nfound in this work. Based on this comparison, our results do not support C2H2\nand HCN being the principal precursors for respectively C2 and CN in Tuttle.\nThe peculiar native composition observed in 8P/Tuttle (compared to other\ncomets) provides new strong evidence for chemical diversity in the volatile\nmaterials stored in comet nuclei. We discuss the implications of this diversity\nfor expected variations in the deuterium enrichment of water among comets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2008 18:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The Classical Kuiper belt conforms\nto a warped sheet that precesses with a 1.9 Myr period. The present-day\nlocation of the Kuiper belt plane can be computed using linear secular\nperturbation theory: the local normal to the plane is given by the theory's\nforced inclination vector, which is specific to every semimajor axis. The\nKuiper belt plane does not coincide with the invariable plane, but deviates\nfrom it by up to a few degrees in stable zones. For example, at a semimajor\naxis of 38 AU, the local Kuiper belt plane has an inclination of 1.9 deg and a\nlongitude of ascending node of 149.9 deg when referred to the mean ecliptic and\nequinox of J2000.

As a result the time step is\nsharply limited by the Courant condition. Also, because the mean flow speed\nwith respect to the grid varies with position, the truncation error varies\nsystematically with position. For hydrodynamic (unmagnetized) disks an\nalgorithm called FARGO has been developed that advects the gas along its mean\norbit using a separate interpolation substep. This relaxes the constraint\nimposed by the Courant condition, which now depends only on the peculiar\nvelocity of the gas, and results in a truncation error that is more nearly\nindependent of position. This paper describes a FARGO-like algorithm suitable\nfor evolving magnetized disks. Our method is second order accurate on a smooth\nflow and preserves the divergence-free constraint to machine precision. The\nmain restriction is that the magnetic field must be discretized on a staggered\nmesh. We give a detailed description of an implementation of the code and\ndemonstrate that it produces the expected results on linear and nonlinear\nproblems. We also point out how the scheme might be generalized to make the\nintegration of other supersonic/super-fast flows more efficient.

We show that when the calculation of\nthe energy of a nucleon is performed using the straightforward generalization\nof the vacuum sector techniques ($\\mu_I=0$), together with the \"natural\"\nassumption $\\mu_I = {\\cal O} (N_c^0)$, the proton and neutron masses are\nnonlinear in $\\mu_I$ in the regime $|\\mu_I| < m_\\pi$.

In this paper, we examine the question of whether\nsupersymmetry itself is ``natural'' (i.e., likely to exist as a fundamental\ncomponent of nature at high energy scales). Our approach to answering this\nquestion is based on a statistical examination of the heterotic string\nlandscape, and our conclusion is that supersymmetry is an exceedingly rare\nphenomenon. We also find that the likelihood of supersymmetry appearing at the\nstring scale is dependent on the gauge symmetries present at the string scale,\nwith certain gauge groups strongly favoring the appearance of N=1 supersymmetry\nand others not. This article summarizes several recent papers, yet also\ncontains some new results. In particular, one new result is that the heterotic\nlandscape appears to favor either the non-supersymmetric Standard Model or an\nN=1 SUSY GUT gauge group at the string scale; by contrast, the opposite\noutcomes (namely the MSSM or a non-supersymmetric GUT) are significantly\ndisfavored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 01:21:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2008 14:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We analyzed the\nFUSE (Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer) spectra of a sample of Herbig\nAe/Be stars (HAeBes) covering a broad spectral range, including the\nmain-sequence A5 star Beta-Pictoris. To better diagnose the origin of the\ndetected H2 and its excitation conditions, we used a model of a\nphotodissociation region. Our analysis demonstrates that the excitation of H2\nis clearly different around most of the HAeBes compared to the interstellar\nmedium. Moreover, the characteristics of H2 around Herbig Ae and Be stars give\nevidence for different excitation mechanisms. For the most massive stars of our\nsample (B8 to B2 type), the excitation diagrams are reproduced well by a model\nof photodissociation regions (PDR). Our results favor an interpretation in\nterms of large CS envelopes, remnants of the molecular clouds in which the\nstars were formed. On the other hand, the group of Ae stars (later than B9\ntype) known to possess disks is more inhomogeneous. In most cases, when CS H2\nis detected, the lines of sight do not pass through the disks. The excitation\nconditions of H2 around Ae stars cannot be reproduced by PDR models and\ncorrespond to warm and/or hot excited media very close to the stars. In\naddition, no clear correlation has been found between the ages of the stars and\nthe amount of circumstellar H2. Our results suggest structural differences\nbetween Herbig Ae and Be star environments. Herbig Be stars do evolve faster\nthan Ae stars, and consequently, most Herbig Be stars are younger than Ae ones\nat the time we observe them. It is thus more likely to find remnants of their\nparent cloud around them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 08:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The results are in good agreement with those derived from\nexperimental data, both regarding the orientation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\nvectors and the magnitude of all exchange integrals. The microscopic analysis\nis confirmed by the results of Green function's and total energies difference\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 09:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-07"}

The\nmost important contribution to the early gamma-ray emission comes from the\nannihilation with electrons of the positrons generated by the decay of 13N and\n18F. The photons are expected to be down-scattered to a few tens of keV, and\nthe emission is predicted to occur some days before the visual discovery and to\nlast ~2 days. Despite a number of attempts, no positive detections of such\nemission have been made, due to lack of sensitivity and of sky coverage.\nBecause of its huge field of view, good sensitivity, and well-adapted energy\nband, Swift/BAT offers a new opportunity for such searches. BAT data can be\nretrospectively used to search for prompt gamma-ray emission from the direction\nof novae after their optical discovery. We have estimated the expected success\nrate for the detection with BAT of gamma rays from classical novae using a\nMonte Carlo approach. Searches were performed for emission from novae occurring\nsince the launch of Swift. Using the actual observing program during the first\n2.3 years of BAT operations as an example, and sensitivity achieved, we\nestimate the expected rate of detection of classical novae with BAT as\n~0.2-0.5/yr, implying that several should be seen within a 10 yr mission. The\nsearch for emission in the directions of the 24 classical novae discovered\nsince the Swift launch yielded no positive results, but none of these was known\nto be close enough for this to be a surprise. Detections of a recurrent nova\n(RS Oph) and a nearby dwarf nova (V455 And) demonstrate the efficacy of the\ntechnique. The absence of detections is consistent with the expectations from\nthe Monte Carlo simulations, but the long-term prospects are encouraging given\nan anticipated Swift operating lifetime of ~10 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 11:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here we discuss in detail numerical solutions to\nthe classical equations for the brane profile and the tachyon condensate. An\nultraviolet cut-off turns out to be essential because the numerical solutions\ntend to rapidly diverge from the desired asymptotic solutions, beyond a\nsufficiently large value of the holographic coordinate. The required cut-off is\ndetermined by the non-normalizable part of the tachyon and is parametrically\nfar smaller than that dictated by consistency of a description in terms of\n10-dimensional bulk gravity. In arXiv:0708.3233 we had argued that the solution\nin which the tachyon field goes to infinity at the point where the brane and\nantibrane meet has only one free parameter, which may be taken to be the\nasymptotic brane-antibrane separation. Here we present numerical evidence in\nfavour of this observation. We also present evidence that the non-normalizable\npart of the asymptotic tachyon solution, which is identified with quark mass in\nthe QCD-like boundary theory, is determined by this parameter. We show that the\nnormalizable part of the asymptotic tachyon solution determines the quark\ncondensate, but this requires holographic renormalization of the on-shell\nboundary brane action because of the presence of infinite cut-off dependent\nterms. Our renormalization scheme gives an exponential dependence on the\ncut-off to the quark mass.

This online problem arises, e.g.,\nin the context of sensor networks. We focus on two main variants of MBP.\n  The discrete MBP is a 2-person game played on a graph $G=(V,E)$. The player\nis initially located at a vertex of the graph. In each time step, the adversary\npours a total of one unit of water into cups that are located on the vertices\nof the graph, arbitrarily distributing the water among the cups. The player\nthen moves from her current vertex to an adjacent vertex and empties the cup at\nthat vertex. The player's objective is to minimize the backlog, i.e., the\nmaximum amount of water in any cup at any time.\n  The geometric MBP is a continuous-time version of the MBP: the cups are\npoints in the two-dimensional plane, the adversary pours water continuously at\na constant rate, and the player moves in the plane with unit speed. Again, the\nplayer's objective is to minimize the backlog.\n  We show that the competitive ratio of any algorithm for the MBP has a lower\nbound of $\\Omega(D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph (for the discrete\nMBP) or the diameter of the point set (for the geometric MBP).

Methods: Our analysis is based on parameters for the warp\nand rotation curve derived previously. The data are taken from the\nLeiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey. Results: The Milky Way HI disk\nis significantly warped but shows a coherent structure out to R = 35 kpc. The\nradial surface density distribution, the densities in the middle of the warped\nplane, and the HI scale heights all follow exponential relations. The radial\nscale length for the surface density distribution of the HI disk is 3.75 kpc.\nGas at the outskirts for 40 < R < 60 kpc is described best by a distribution\nwith an exponential radial scale length of 7.5 kpc and a velocity dispersion of\n74 km/s. Such a highly turbulent medium fits also well with the average shape\nof the high velocity profile wings observed at high latitudes. The turbulent\npressure gradient of such extra-planar gas is on average in balance with the\ngravitational forces. About 10% of the Milky Way HI gas is in this state. The\nlarge scale HI distribution is lopsided; for R < 15 kpc there is more gas in\nthe south. The HI flaring indicates that this asymmetry is caused by a dark\nmatter wake, located at R = 25 kpc in direction of the Magellanic System.\nConclusions: The HI disk is made up of two major components. Most prominent is\nthe normal HI disk which can be traced to R = 35 kpc.

The 1D\nholes are demonstrated to be spin-polarised at low sheet density, because the\n0.7(2e2/h) feature is close to the value of 0.5(2e2/h) that indicates the spin\ndegeneracy lifting for the first step of the quantum conductance staircase. The\n0.7(2e2/h) feature is found to take however the value of 0.75(2e2/h) when the\nsheet density increases thereby giving rise to the spin depolarisation of the\n1D holes. Secondly, the amplitude and phase sensitivity of the 0.7(2e2/h)\nfeature are studied by varying the value of the external magnetic field and the\ntop gate voltage that are applied perpendicularly to the plane of the\ndouble-slit ring embedded in the p-type SQW, with the extra quantum point\ncontact inserted in the one of its arms. The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) and the\nAharonov-Casher (AC) conductance oscillations obtained are evidence of the\ninterplay of the spontaneous spin polarisation and the Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction (SOI) in the formation of the 0.7(2e2/h) feature. Finally, the\nvariations of the 0.7(2e2/h) feature caused by the Rashba SOI are found to take\nin the fractional form with both the plateaux and steps as a function of the\ntop gate voltage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 13:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-01"}

Prudent walks differ from most\nclasses of SAW that have been counted so far in that they can wind around their\nstarting point. Their enumeration was first addressed by Pr\\'ea in 1997. He\ndefined 4 classes of prudent walks, of increasing generality, and wrote a\nsystem of recurrence relations for each of them . However, these relations\ninvolve more and more parameters as the generality of the class increases. The\nfirst class actually consists of partially directed walks, and its generating\nfunction is well-known to be rational. The second class was proved to have an\nalgebraic (quadratic) generating function by Duchi (2005). Here, we solve\nexactly the third class, which turns out to be much more complex: its\ngenerating function is not algebraic, nor even D-finite. The fourth class --\ngeneral prudent walks -- is the only isotropic one, and still defeats us.\nHowever, we design an isotropic family of prudent walks on the triangular\nlattice, which we count exactly. Again, the generating function is proved to be\nnon-D-finite. We also study the asymptotic properties of these classes of\nwalks, with the (somewhat disappointing) conclusion that their endpoint moves\naway from the origin at a positive speed. This is confirmed visually by the\nrandom generation procedures we have designed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 15:12:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 18:08:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 09:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

The Born\nprobabilities emerge as the relative frequencies of outcomes in long runs of\nmeasurements on a quantum system; it is not necessary to adopt the frequency\ninterpretation of single-case probabilities (which will be the subject of a\nsequel paper). Our derivation of the Born rule uses ideas from a program begun\nby Finkelstein (1965) and Hartle (1968), intending to remove the Born rule as a\nseparate postulate of quantum mechanics. Mathematically speaking, our approach\nrefines previous elaborations of this program - notably the one due to Farhi,\nGoldstone, and Gutmann (1989) as completed by Van Wesep (2006) - in replacing\ninfinite tensor products of Hilbert spaces by continuous fields of C*-algebras.\nIn combination with our interpretational context, this technical improvement\ncircumvents valid criticisms that earlier derivations of the Born rule have\nprovoked, especially to the effect that such derivations were mathematically\nflawed as well as circular. Furthermore, instead of relying on the\ncontroversial eigenvector-eigenvalue link in quantum theory, our derivation\njust assumes that pure states in classical physics have the usual\ninterpretation as truthmakers that assign sharp values to observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 15:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-01"}

If the average\nupstream velocity on the mainline drops below a predetermined value (20 m/s)\nvehicles are diverted to the downstream ramp. When the average mainline\nvelocity downstream becomes too low, diversion is no longer permitted. The\nresultant oscillations in this scheme are nearly periodic. The period is\ndominated by the response time of the mainline to interruption of merging\nrather than delayed feedback, which contributes only a minor component linear\nin the distance separating the on-ramps. In general the second scheme produces\nmore effective congestion reduction and greater throughput. Also the travel\ntimes for on-ramp drivers are less than that obtained by drivers who attempt to\nminimize their own travel times (first scheme).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 15:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-12"}
