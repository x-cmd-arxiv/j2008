Therefore\nthermodynamically consistent approximate treatment of systems of particles with\nfinite mass-widths can be performed, provided spectral functions of particle\nspecies are known. Approximation of the free resonance gas at low densities is\nstudied. Simple ansatz for the energy dependence of the spectral function is\nsuggested that allows to fulfill thermodynamical consistency conditions.

As the system\ninclination is very small (i=0.77 +- 0.09 deg), HD 45166 is an ideal laboratory\nfor wind-structure studies. The goal of the present paper is to determine the\nfundamental stellar and wind parameters of the qWR star. A radiative transfer\nmodel for the wind and photosphere of the qWR star was calculated using the\nnon-LTE code CMFGEN. The wind asymmetry was also analyzed using a\nrecently-developed version of CMFGEN to compute the emerging spectrum in\ntwo-dimensional geometry. The temporal-variance spectrum (TVS) was calculated\nfor studying the line-profile variations. Abundances, stellar and wind\nparameters of the qWR star were obtained. The qWR star has an effective\ntemperature of Teff=50000 +- 2000 K, a luminosity of log(L/Lsun)=3.75 +- 0.08,\nand a corresponding photospheric radius of Rphot=1.00 Rsun. The star is\nhelium-rich (N(H)/N(He) = 2.0), while the CNO abundances are anomalous when\ncompared either to solar values, to planetary nebulae, or to WR stars. The\nmass-loss rate is Mdot = 2.2 . 10^{-7} Msun/yr, and the wind terminal velocity\nis vinf=425 km/s. The comparison between the observed line profiles and models\ncomputed under different latitude-dependent wind densities strongly suggests\nthe presence of an oblate wind density enhancement, with a density contrast of\nat least 8:1 from equator to pole. If a high velocity polar wind is present\n(~1200 km/s), the minimum density contrast is reduced to 4:1.

We\nobtained low resolution optical spectra for a subsample of 4 candidates in Ori\nOB1a and 26 in Ori OB1b; as a result we confirmed 3 new members in Ori OB1a,\none of which is substellar, and 19 new members in Ori OB1b, out of which 7 are\nat the substellar limit and 5 are substellar. We looked into the presence of\naccretion signatures by measuring the strength of the Ha line in emission.\nAccordingly, we classified the new members as having Classical T-Tauri star\n(CTTS) or Weak Lined T Tauri star-like (WTTS) nature. We found that all the new\nmembers confirmed in Ori OB1a are WTTSs, while 39 +25/-22 % of the new members\nin Ori OB1b exhibit CTTS-like behavior, suggestive of ongoing accretion from a\ncircum(sub)stellar disk. Additionally we found that none of the members\nconfirmed in OB1a show near-IR color excess while 38 +26/-21 % of OB1b members\nshow H-K color excess. These results are consistent with recent findings for\nlow mass young stars in Orion OB1. The similarity in CTTS-like properties and\nnear-IR excess across the substellar boundary gives support to the idea of a\ncommon formation mechanism for low mass stars and at least the most massive\nbrown dwarfs. Finally, we remark the discovery of two new members classified as\nCTTSs, both exhibiting W(Ha) < -140 A, suggesting significant ongoing\naccretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 20:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this paper, we present a detailed\nstudy of this PN using archival HST WFPC2 and ground-based narrow-band images\nto investigate its morphology, and long-slit spectroscopic observations to\ndetermine its kinematics and to derive its physical conditions and excitation.\nThe data reveal new structural components, including a distant string of knots\ndistributed along an arc-like feature 40\"-60\" from the center of the nebula, a\nskin of enhanced [O III]/H-alpha ratio enveloping the inner shell and the\ndouble-S feature, and a triple-shell structure. The spatio-kinematical study\nalso finds an equatorial component of the main nebula that is kinematically\nindependent from the bright inner S-shaped arc. We have investigated in detail\nthe bow shock-like features in IC 4634 and found that their morphological,\nkinematical and emission properties are consistent with the interaction of a\ncollimated outflow with surrounding material. Indeed, the morphology and\nkinematics of some of these features can be interpreted using a 3D numerical\nsimulation of a collimated outflow precessing at a moderate, time-dependent\nvelocity. Apparently, IC 4634 has experienced several episodes of\npoint-symmetric ejections oriented at different directions with the outer\nS-shaped feature being related to an earlier point-symmetric ejection and the\noutermost arc-like string of knots being the relic of an even much earlier\npoint-symmetric ejection. There is tantalizing evidence that the action of\nthese collimated outflows has also taken part in the shaping of the innermost\nshell and inner S-shaped arc of IC 4634.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 21:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We compute the cross-correlation function between\nW-R galaxies and a reference sample of galaxies drawn from the DR4. We compare\nthe function to the results for control samples of non-W-R star-forming\ngalaxies that are matched closely in redshift, luminosity, concentration,\n4000-\\AA break strength and specific star formation rate (SSFR). On scales\nlarger than a few Mpc, W-R galaxies have almost the same clustering amplitude\nas the control samples, indicating that W-R galaxies and non-W-R control\ngalaxies populate dark matter haloes of similar masses. On scales between\n0.1--1$h^{-1}$ Mpc, W-R galaxies are less clustered than the control samples,\nand the size of the difference depends on the SSFR. Based on both observational\nand theoretical considerations, we speculate that this negative bias can be\ninterpreted by W-R galaxies residing preferentially at the centers of their\ndark matter haloes. We examine the distribution of W-R galaxies more closely\nusing the SDSS galaxy group catalogue of Yang et al., and find that $\\sim$82%\nof our W-R galaxies are the central galaxies of groups, compared to $\\sim$74%\nfor the corresponding control galaxies.

The space requirements of the\ndictionary we suggest are much smaller than those of a hashtable. We allow\nstoring n keys, each mapped to value which is a string of k bits. Our suggested\nmethod requires nk + o(n) bits space to store the dictionary, and O(n) time to\nproduce the data structure, and allows answering a membership query in O(1)\nmemory probes. The dictionary size does not depend on the size of the keys.\nHowever, reducing the space requirements of the data structure comes at a\ncertain cost. Our dictionary has a small probability of a one sided error. When\nattempting to obtain the value for a key that is stored in the dictionary we\nalways get the correct answer. However, when testing for membership of an\nelement that is not stored in the dictionary, we may get an incorrect answer,\nand when requesting the value of such an element we may get a certain random\nvalue. Our method is based on solving equations in GF(2^k) and using several\nhash functions. Another significant advantage of our suggested method is that\nwe do not require using sophisticated hash functions. We only require pairwise\nindependent hash functions.

In order\nreplace a Bloom Filter of n elements with an error proability of 2^{-k}, we\nrequire nk + o(n) memory bits, O(1) query time, O(n) preprocessing time, and\nonly pairwise independent hash function.

The low redshift, and a rich set of archival Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) images, makes this GRB well-suited for a detailed study of the stellar\npopulation in the immediate vicinity of the explosion. Since the lifetime of a\nstar is directly tied to its mass, the age of the stellar population can be\nused to put constraints on the GRB and SN progenitor mass. From the HST images\nwe extract the colours of the precise site from which the GRB originated, and\nfind that the colours are significantly different from those of the overall\nhost galaxy and the surrounding starburst environment. We have used spectral\nevolutionary models, including nebular emission, to carefully constrain the age\nof the stellar population, and hence the progenitor, at the very explosion\nsite. For instantaneous burst models we find that a population age of 5 Myr\nbest matches the data, suggesting a very massive (M > 50 M_sun) star as the\nprogenitor, with an upper limit of 8 Myr (M > 25 M_sun). For more extended star\nformation scenarios, the inferred progenitor age is in most cases still very\nyoung (age < 7 Myr, implying M > 25 M_sun), with an upper limit of 20 Myr (M >\n12 M_sun). These age estimates are an order of magnitude lower than the ages\ninferred from the overall host galaxy colours, indicating that progenitor mass\nestimates based on data for spatially unresolved GRB host galaxies will in\ngeneral be of limited use. Our results are consistent with the collapsar\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2008 09:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

By investigating the origin of such\nremarkable variances we find that, besides a couple of obvious factors, such as\nthe adopted fitting technique and the method used to measure the photometric\nand kinematic variables, the coefficients of the FP are strongly influenced by\na number of things, mainly related to the distribution of photometric/kinematic\nproperties of galaxies in the particular sample under analysis.

It has been recognized that multi-path routing can be more efficient\nthan traditional one mainly for mobile ad hoc networks, where route failure\nevents are frequent. Most studies in the area of multi-path routing focus on\nheuristic methods, and the performances of these strategies are commonly\nevaluated by numerical simulations. The need of a theoretical analysis\nmotivates such a paper, which proposes to resort to the terminal-pair routing\nreliability as performance metric. This metric allows one to assess the\nperformance gain due to the availability of route diversity. By resorting to\ngraph theory, we propose an analytical framework to evaluate the tolerance of\nmulti-path route discovery processes against route failures for mobile ad hoc\nnetworks. Moreover, we derive a useful bound to easily estimate the performance\nimprovements achieved by multi-path routing with respect to any traditional\nrouting protocol.

Firstly, we use\nthe background modeling, rather than the background subtraction, and the Cash\nstatistic rather than the chi square; this method requires a careful\ncharacterization of all background components. Secondly, we assess in details\nsystematic effects. We perform two groups of test: prior to the analysis, we\nmake use of extensive simulations to quantify the impact of different spectral\ncomponents on simulated spectra; after the analysis, we investigate how the\nmeasured temperature profile changes, when choosing different key parameters.\n  Results. The mean temperature profile declines beyond 0.2 R_{180}; for the\nfirst time we provide an assessment of the source and the magnitude of\nsystematic uncertainties.

We took optical spectra of 176 X-ray candidates and companions at\nESO, Calar Alto observatory and McDonald observatory. We discuss the redshift-,\nlinewidth-, as well as optical and X-ray luminosity distribution of our ROSAT\nselected sample. 139 galaxies of our 166 X-ray counterparts have been\nidentified as AGN with 93 being Seyfert 1 galaxies (61%). Eighteen of them\n(20%) are Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies. 34 X-ray candidates (21%) are LINERs\nand only eight candidates (5%) are Seyfert 2. The ratio of the number of\nSeyfert 1 galaxies to Seyfert 2 galaxies is about 11/1. Optical surveys result\nin ratios of 1/1.4. The high fraction of detected Seyfert 1 galaxies is\nexplained by the sensitivity of the ROSAT to soft X-rays which are heavily\nabsorbed in type 2 AGN. Two X-ray candidates are HII-galaxies and 25 candidates\n(15%) show no signs of spectral activity. The AGN in our RASS selected sample\nexhibit slightly higher optical luminosities M_B = (-20.71 +- 1.75) mag and\nsimilar X-ray luminosities (log(L_X [erg/s]) = 42.9 +- 1.7) compared to other\nAGN surveys. The Halpha line width distribution (FWHM) of our newly identified\nROSAT AGN sample is similar to the line widths distribution based on SDSS AGN.\nHowever, our newly identified RASS AGN have rather reddish colors explaining\nwhy they have not been detected before in ultraviolet or blue excess surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2008 15:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These data show that there is a bimodal distribution in half-light\nradii, with stable star clusters always being smaller than 35pc, while stable\ngalaxies are always larger than 120pc. We extend the previously known\nobservational relationships and interpret them in terms of a more fundamental\npair of intrinsic properties of dark matter itself: dark matter forms cored\nmass distributions, with a core scale length of greater than about 100pc, and\nalways has a maximum central mass density with a narrow range. The dark matter\nin dSph galaxies appears to be clustered such that there is a mean volume mass\ndensity within the stellar distribution which has the very low value of about\n0.1$M_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$. None of the dSphs displays kinematics which require\nthe presence of an inner cusp, while in two dSphs there is evidence that the\ndensity profile is shallow (cored) in the inner regions. The maximum central\ndark matter density derived is model dependent, but is likely to have a mean\nvalue (averaged over a volume of radius 10pc) of about 0.1$M_{\\odot}$\npc$^{-3}$, which is 5GeV/c$^2$cm$^{-3}$). Galaxies are embedded in dark matter\nhalos with these properties; smaller systems containing dark matter are not\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2008 15:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-14"}
