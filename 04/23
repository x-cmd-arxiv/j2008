This behavior is reminiscent of the\nmorphology-density relation (Dressler 1980) in that the effect manifests itself\nonly at cluster-type densities, and indeed when we plot both the HI\ndeficiency-density and morphology-density relations, we see that the densities\nat which they \"turn up\" are similar.

We have made spectroscopic measurements from ground and photometric\nmeasurements from the WIRE star tracker and the SMEI instrument on the Coriolis\nsatellite. Measurements of the amplitude of the dominant oscillation (P = 4\ndays), that go back more than a century, show a decrease from 120 mmag to 30\nmmag (V magnitude) around the turn of the millennium. It has been speculated\nthat the reason for the decrease in amplitude is the evolution of Polaris\ntowards the edge of the instability strip. However, our new data reveal an\nincrease in the amplitude by about 30% from 2003-2006. It now appears that the\namplitude change is cyclic rather than monotonic, and most likely the result of\na pulsation phenomenon. In addition, previous radial velocity campaigns have\nclaimed the detection of long-period variation in Polaris (P > 40 days). Our\nradial velocity data are more precise than previous datasets, and we find no\nevidence for additional variation for periods in the range 3-50 days with an\nupper limit of 100 m/s.

Two XMM-Newton observations performed in 2006 reveal that\nthe 0.6--10 keV X-ray spectra of the source harden ($\\Delta\\Gamma \\sim$\n0.1--0.3) at break energies of about 4 keV. The concave X-ray spectra of the\nsource could be easily interpretated by a mixture of a steep component (i.e.,\nthe high energy tail of the synchrotron emission) and a flat one (i.e., the low\nenergy side of the IC emission).

The quasi-simultaneous\noptical-UV-X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) obtained with XMM-Newton\nsuggest that the concave X-ray spectra of the source could be the result of\ndown-ward shift of the synchrotron peak frequency to the optical band, incuring\nthe IC emisssion to become more important in the hard ($\\sim 4$--10 keV) X-ray\nband with respective to other cases in which the synchrotron emission peaks in\nthe UV-soft-X-ray range.

The change-over is brought about only by reducing the size and with\nno change in the stoichiometry. The size reduction to an average size of about\n15 nm retains the ferromagnetic state albeit with somewhat smaller saturation\nmagnetization and the ferromagnetic transition temperature T_{C} is suppressed\nby a small amount (4%). The magnetization of the nanoparticles near T_{C}\nfollow the scaling equation $M/|\\epsilon|^\\beta =\nf_\\pm(H/|\\epsilon|^{\\gamma+\\beta})$, where, $\\epsilon = |T-T_C|/T_C$.

The aim of this paper is to take the\nFrequency Analysis a step further. It will be shown that keeping the same\nreconstruction algorithm as the Fourier Theorem but changing to a new computing\nmethod for the analysis phase allows the generalization of the Fourier Theorem\nto a large class of nonorthogonal bases. New methods and algorithms can be\nemployed in function decomposition on such generic bases. It will be shown that\nthese algorithms are a generalization of the Fourier analysis, i.e. they are\nreduced to the familiar Fourier tools when using orthogonal bases. The\ndifferences between this tool and the wavelets and frames theories will be\ndiscussed. Examples of analysis and reconstruction of functions using the given\nalgorithms and nonorthogonal bases will be given.

Subsequently, adding\nelectrostatic forces to the geodesic moment equations relates them to the\nBenney equations and to the equations for beam dynamics in particle\naccelerators. Next, we develop a kinetic theory for self assembly in\nnano-particles. Darcy's law is introduced as a general principle for\naggregation dynamics in friction dominated systems (at different scales). Then,\na kinetic equation is introduced for the dissipative motion of isotropic\nnano-particles. The zeroth-moment dynamics of this equation recovers the\nclassical Darcy's law at the macroscopic level. A kinetic-theory description\nfor oriented nano-particles is also presented. At the macroscopic level, the\nzeroth moments of this kinetic equation recover the magnetization dynamics of\nthe Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The moment equations exhibit the\nspontaneous emergence of singular solutions (clumpons) that finally merge in\none singularity.

Here, Brownian transport is\nstudied in micro-sized, two dimensional periodic channels, exhibiting\nperiodically varying cross sections. The particles in addition are subjected to\nan external force acting alongside the direction of the longitudinal channel\naxis. For a fixed channel geometry, the dynamics of the two dimensional problem\nis characterized by a single dimensionless parameter which is proportional to\nthe ratio of the applied force and the temperature of the particle environment.\nIn such structures entropic effects may play a dominant role. Under certain\nconditions the two dimensional dynamics can be approximated by an effective one\ndimensional motion of the particle in the longitudinal direction. The Langevin\nequation describing this reduced, one dimensional process is of the type of the\nFick-Jacobs equation. It contains an entropic potential determined by the\nvarying extension of the eliminated channel direction, and a correction to the\ndiffusion constant that introduces a space dependent diffusion. Different forms\nof this correction term have been suggested before, which we here compare for a\nparticular class of models. We analyze the regime of validity of the\nFick-Jacobs equation, both by means of analytical estimates and the comparisons\nwith numerical results for the full two dimensional stochastic dynamics.

In a wide binary, each galaxy possesses individual\ntangential, nearly astroidal, caustics and roundish radial caustics.

The first metamorphosis occurs when the tangential caustics\nmerge to form a single six-cusped caustic, lying interior to the radial\ncaustics. At still smaller separations, the six-cusped caustic undergoes the\nsecond metamorphosis and splits into a four-cusped caustic and two three-cusped\ncaustics, which shrink to zero size (an elliptic umbilic catastrophe) before\nthey enlarge again and move away from the origin perpendicular to the binary\naxis.
