Magnetic ambipolar diffusion occurs very\nrapidly initially due to the sharp gradients introduced by the turbulent flow.\nIt subsequently occurs more slowly in the traditional near-quasistatic manner,\nbut in regions of greater mean density than present in the initial state. The\noverall timescale for runaway growth of the first core(s) is several times,\n10^6 yr, even though previous studies have found a timescale of several times,\n10^7 yr when starting with linear perturbations and similar physical\nparameters. Large-scale supersonic flows exist in the cloud and provide an\nobservationally testable distinguishing characteristic from core formation due\nto linear initial perturbations. However, the nonlinear flows have decayed\nsufficiently that the relative infall motions onto the first core are subsonic,\nas in the case of starting from linear initial perturbations. The ion infall\nmotions are very similar to those of neutrals; however, they lag the neutral\ninfall in directions perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction and\nlead the neutral infall in the direction parallel to the mean magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Apr 2008 23:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nprimary component of the binary is located at the top of the main-sequence\nturn-off on the cluster color-magnitude diagram. Only a shallow primary eclipse\nis observed in the light curve.

The aim of\nthis work is to test two formation hypotheses for UCDs--whether they are bright\nglobular clusters (GCs) or \"threshed'' early-type dwarf galaxies--by comparison\nof UCD structural parameters and colors with GCs and galaxy nuclei. We find\nthat the UCD surface brightness profiles can be described by a range of models\nand that the luminous UCDs can not be described by standard King models with\ntidal cutoffs as they have extended outer halos. This is not expected from\ntraditional King models of GCs, but is consistent with recent results for\nmassive GCs. The total luminosities, colors and sizes of the UCDs are\nconsistent with them being either luminous GCs or threshed nuclei of both\nearly-type and late-type galaxies (not just early-type dwarfs). For the most\nluminous UCDs we estimate color gradients over a limited range of radius. These\nare systematically positive in the sense of getting redder outwards: mean\nDelta(F606W-F814W)=0.14 mag per 100 pc with rms=0.06 mag per 100 pc. The\npositive gradients found in the bright UCDs are consistent with them being\neither bright GCs or threshed early-type dwarf galaxies (except VUCD3). In\ncontrast to the above results we find a very significant difference in the\nsizes of UCDs and early-type galaxy nuclei: the effective radii of UCDs are 2.2\ntimes larger than those of early-type galaxy nuclei at the same luminosity.\nThis result suggests an important test can be made of the threshing hypothesis\nby simulating the process and predicting what size increase is expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 09:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Colossal dielectric permittivity\noften is measured in this class of semiconducting materials as a result of\nextrinsic factors. Our results show that a large offset in the capacitance,\nmeasured on a series of samples with different thickness, is due to the\ninterfacial polarization. This contribution then can be removed from the data,\ncreating a general procedure for dielectric measurements in semiconducting\nsamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 12:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-02"}

These observations are very sensitive to the thermal\nconductivity $\\kappa$ of the crust and strongly suggest that $\\kappa$ is large.\nWe perform molecular dynamics simulations of the structure of the crust of an\naccreting neutron star using a complex composition that includes many\nimpurities. The composition comes from simulations of rapid proton capture\nnucleosynthesys followed by electron captures. We find that the thermal\nconductivity is reduced by impurity scattering. In addition, we find phase\nseparation. Some impurities with low atomic number $Z$ are concentrated in a\nsubregion of the simulation volume. For our composition, the solid crust must\nseparate into regions of different compositions. This could lead to an\nasymmetric star with a quadrupole deformation that radiates gravitational\nwaves. Observations of crust cooling can constrain impurity concentrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 13:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2008 14:49:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 16:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

At zero temperature we\nidentify four phases in the plane (U,n) [U is the onsite potential and n is the\nfilling] and relative phase transitions as well as different types of charge\nordering. These features are endorsed by investigating at T=0 the chemical\npotential and pertinent local correlators, the particle and double occupancy\ncorrelation functions, the entropy, and by studying the behavior in the limit T\ngoing to zero of the charge and spin susceptibilities. A detailed study of the\nthermodynamic quantities is also presented at finite temperature. This study\nevidences that a finite-range order persists for a wide range of the\ntemperature, as shown by the behavior of the correlation functions and by the\ntwo-peak structure exhibited by the charge susceptibility and by the entropy.\nMoreover, the equation of motion formalism, together with the use of composite\noperators, allows us to exactly determine the set of elementary excitations.

SPACE aims to\nproduce the largest three-dimensional evolutionary map of the Universe over the\npast 10 billion years by taking near-IR spectra and measuring redshifts for\nmore than half a billion galaxies at 0<z<2 down to AB~23 over 3\\pi sr of the\nsky. In addition, SPACE will also target a smaller sky field, performing a deep\nspectroscopic survey of millions of galaxies to AB~26 and at 2<z<10+. These\ngoals are unreachable with ground-based observations due to the ~500 times\nhigher sky background. To achieve the main science objectives, SPACE will use a\n1.5m diameter Ritchey-Chretien telescope equipped with a set of arrays of\nDigital Micro-mirror Devices (DMDs) covering a total field of view of 0.4 deg2,\nand will perform large-multiplexing multi-object spectroscopy (e.g. ~6000\ntargets per pointing) at a spectral resolution of R~400 as well as\ndiffraction-limited imaging with continuous coverage from 0.8mum to 1.8mum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 15:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

However,\nblack holes need not be defined by event horizons, and in fact we argue that in\norder to have a fully unitary evolution for black holes, they should be defined\nin terms of something else, such as a trapping horizon. The Misner-Sharp mass\nin spherical symmetry shows very simply how trapping horizons can give rise to\nblack hole thermodynamics, Hawking radiation and singularities.

Last article of this series","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"math-ph math.MP","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","abstract":"  Finite collections of point masses contained in some bounded domain produce a\nunique field in the exterior domain, which means that the associated basis\nfunctions (often called ``fundamental solutions'') are independent. A new proof\nof this result is given in this paper that can be generalized to other finite\ncombinations of point source distributions. For example, this paper shows in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$ that a finite combination of point dipoles produces a unique\nfield. The strategy employed in the paper is to develop results for analytic\nfunctions in the complex plane and then carry them over to harmonic functions\nin the real plane, and from there to harmonic functions in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. More\nresults are shown for $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and for $\\mathbb{C}$ than are shown for\nmore general settings. For example, in the complex plane, the paper shows that\na finite combination of higher order poles of any order in the interior of a\nunit disk always corresponds to a unique analytic function in the exterior of a\nunit disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 15:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-29"}
