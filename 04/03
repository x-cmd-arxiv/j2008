But interacting dark energy models can suffer from\npathologies. We consider the case where the dark energy is modelled as a fluid\nwith constant equation of state parameter w. Non-interacting constant-w models\nare well behaved in the background and in the perturbed universe. But the\ncombination of constant w and a simple interaction with dark matter leads to an\ninstability in the dark sector perturbations at early times: the curvature\nperturbation blows up on super-Hubble scales. Our results underline how\nimportant it is to carefully analyze the relativistic perturbations when\nconsidering models of coupled dark energy. The instability that we find has\nbeen missed in some previous work where the perturbations were not consistently\ntreated. The unstable mode dominates even if adiabatic initial conditions are\nused. The instability also arises regardless of how weak the coupling is. This\nnon-adiabatic instability is different from previously discovered adiabatic\ninstabilities on small scales in the strong-coupling regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2008 19:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2008 20:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2008 13:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This Regge Calculus (RC) is strikingly\ndifferent from the more usual finite difference and finite element\ndiscretizations of gravity. In RC the fundamental principles of General\nRelativity are applied directly to a tessellated spacetime geometry. In this\nmanuscript, and in the spirit of this conference, we reexamine the foundations\nof RC and emphasize the central role that the Voronoi and Delaunay lattices\nplay in this discrete theory. In particular we describe, for the first time, a\ngeometric construction of the scalar curvature invariant at a vertex. This\nderivation makes use of a new fundamental lattice cell built from elements\ninherited from both the simplicial (Delaunay) spacetime and its circumcentric\ndual (Voronoi) lattice. The orthogonality properties between these two lattices\nyield an expression for the vertex-based scalar curvature which is strikingly\nsimilar to the corresponding and more familiar hinge-based expression in RC\n(deficit angle per unit Voronoi dual area). In particular, we show that the\nscalar curvature is simply a vertex-based weighted average of deficits per\nweighted average of dual areas. What is most striking to us is how naturally\nspacetime is represented by Voronoi and Delaunay structures and that the laws\nof gravity appear to be encoded locally on the lattice spacetime with less\ncomplexity than in the continuum, yet the continuum is recovered by convergence\nin mean. Perhaps these prominent features may enable us to transcend the\ndetails of any particular discrete model gravitation and yield clues to help us\ndiscover how we may begin to quantize this fundamental interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2008 19:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-03"}

Let $X = G/H$ be a homogeneous manifold of\na Lie group $G$ and let $d$ be a geodesic distance on $X$ inducing the same\ntopology. Suppose there exists a subgroup $G_S$ of $G$ that acts transitively\non $X$, such that each element $g \\in G_S$ induces a locally biLipschitz\nhomeomorphism of the metric space $(X,d)$. Then the metric is locally\nbiLipschitz equivalent to a sub-Riemannian metric. Any such metric is defined\nby a bracket generating $G_S$-invariant sub-bundle of the tangent bundle.\n  The result is a consequence of a more general fact that requires a transitive\nfamily of uniformly biLipschitz diffeomorphisms with a control on their\ndifferentials. It will be relevant that the group acting transitively on the\nspace is a Lie group and so it is locally compact, since, in general, the whole\ngroup of biLipschitz maps, unlikely the isometry group, is not locally compact.\n  Our method also gives an elementary proof of the following fact. Given a\nLipschitz sub-bundle of the tangent bundle of a Finsler manifold, then both the\nclass of piecewise differentiable curves tangent to the sub-bundle and the\nclass of Lipschitz curves almost everywhere tangent to the sub-bundle give rise\nto the same Finsler-Carnot-Carath\\'eodory metric, under the condition that the\ntopologies induced by these distances coincide with the manifold topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2008 17:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 12:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

Resonant, magnetic\nCompton upscattering is a candidate mechanism for generating this new\ncomponent, since it is very efficient in the strong fields present near AXP\nsurfaces. In this paper, results from an inner magnetospheric model for\nupscattering of surface thermal X-rays in AXPs are presented, using a kinetic\nequation formalism and employing a QED magnetic scattering cross section.\nCharacteristically flat and strongly-polarized emission spectra are produced by\nnon-thermal electrons injected in the emission region. Spectral results depend\nstrongly on the observer's orientation and the magnetospheric locale of the\nscattering, which couple directly to the angular distributions of photons\nsampled. Constraints imposed by the Comptel upper bounds for these AXPs are\nmentioned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2008 20:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Accretion can occur for several million years after the stars\nform, but before the cluster disperses. This accretion is predominantly onto\nthe disk and not the star. N-body simulations of stars orbiting in three young\nmodel clusters containing 30, 300, and 3000 stars are presented. The\nsimulations include the gravitational potential of the molecular gas which\nsmoothly disperses over time. The clusters have a star formation efficiency of\n33% and a radius of 0.22 pc. We find that the disks surrounding solar-mass\nstars in the N=30 cluster accretes ~0.01 M_sol (~1 minimum-mass solar nebula,\nMMSN) per Myr. The accretion rate scales as M^2.1 for stars of mass M. The\naccretion rate is ~5 times lower for N=3000 cluster, due to its higher stellar\nvelocities and higher temperature. The Bondi-Hoyle accretion rates onto the\ndisks are several times lower than accretion rates observed directly onto young\nstars (e.g., Muzerolle et al 2005): these two accretion rates follow the same\nM^2 behavior and may be related. The accreted disk mass is large enough that it\nmay have a substantial and unappreciated effect on disk structure and the\nformation of planetary systems.

As an application, we extend the known results due\nto the latter authors about the stability of the isoperimetric profile under\ntensorization, when there is no Central-Limit obstruction. As another\napplication, we show that under our convexity assumptions, $q$-log-Sobolev\ninequalities ($q \\in [1,2]$) are equivalent to an appropriate family of\nisoperimetric inequalities, extending results of Bakry--Ledoux and\nBobkov--Zegarlinski. Our results extend to the more general setting of\nRiemannian manifolds with density which satisfy the $CD(0,\\infty)$\ncurvature-dimension condition of Bakry--\\'Emery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2008 00:29:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2008 19:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

We argue that while quasars at z<6.5 seem to\nreside in the post overlap IGM, they will still provide valuable probes of the\nlate stages of the overlap era because the light-travel time across a quasar\nproximity zone should be comparable to the duration of overlap.

Our results can be used to reduce or eliminate the\natomic excess noise, therefore improving the sensitivity of nonlinear\nmagneto-optical rotation magnetometers and other atom-optical based\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2008 05:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The cluster centered on the BL Lac works as a strong gravitational\nlens, forming a large arc around itself. The aim of this paper is to study the\nenvironment and characteristics of this object more accurately than the\nenvironments of other BL Lac objects have been before.We measured the redshifts\nof galaxies in the cluster from the absorption lines in their spectra. The\nvelocity dispersion was then obtained from the redshifts. The gravitational\nlensing was used for measuring the mass at the center of the cluster. The mass\nof the whole cluster could then be estimated using the softened isothermal\nsphere mass distribution. Finally, the richness of the cluster was determined\nby counting the number of galaxies near the BL Lac object and obtaining the\ngalaxy-BL Lac spatial covariance function, $B_{gb}$. The redshifts of nine\ngalaxies in the field were measured to be near the redshift of the BL Lac\nobject, confirming the presence of a cluster. The average redshift of the\ncluster is 0.268, and the velocity dispersion $(470^{+190}_{-110})$ km\ns$^{-1}$. The mass of the cluster is $M_{500}=(4^{+3}_{-2})\\times10^{14}\nM_{\\sun}$ which implies a rather massive cluster. The richness measurement also\nsuggests that this is a rich cluster: the result for covariance function is\n$B_{gb}=(600\\pm200)$ Mpc$^{1.77}$, which corresponds to Abell richness class 1\nand which is consistent with the mass and velocity dispersion of the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2008 08:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Systems with sufficiently\nmassive WD companions may qualify as SN Ia progenitors. Recently evidence has\nbeen found that the masses of some unseen companions might exceed the\nChandrasekhar mass, hence they must be neutron stars or black holes. Even a\nplanet has recently been detected orbiting the pulsating sdB star V391 Peg.\nQuite to the opposite, in globular clusters, only very few sdB binaries are\nfound indicating that the dominant sdB formation processes is different in a\ndense environment. Binary population synthesis models identify three formation\nchannels, (i) stable Roche lobe overflow, (ii) one or two common envelope\nejection phases and (iii) the merger of two helium white dwarfs. The latter\nchannel may explain the properties of the He-enriched sdO stars because their\nbinary fraction is lower than that of the sdBs by a factor of ten or more.\nPulsating subluminous B (sdB) stars play an important role for asteroseismology\nas this technique has already led to mass determinations for a handful of\nstars.

It allows\nus to simplify the weak-degradability classification.

Using simulations of major mergers in 3D, we study the time\nevolution of these asymmetries in a pair of galaxies, during the first passage.\nOur main results are: (a) the rotation curve asymmetries appear right at\npericentre of the first passage, (b) the significant disturbed rotation\nvelocities occur within a small time interval, of ~ 0.5 Gyr h^-1, and therefore\nthe presence of bifurcation in the velocity curve could be used as an indicator\nof the pericentre occurrence.

Inside\nthe disk, dark matter can be captured by stars causing an enhanced annihilation\nrate and therefore a potentially higher neutrino flux than what would be\nobserved from elsewhere in the halo. We estimate a neutrino flux from the WIMP\nannihilations in the stellar disk to be enhanced by more than an order of\nmagnitude compared to the neutrino fluxes from the halo. We offer a\nconservative estimate for this enhanced flux, based on the WIMP-nucleon\ncross-sections obtained from direct-detection experiments by assuming a density\nof around 0.3 GeV/cm^3 for the local DM. We also compare the detectability of\nthese fluxes with a signal of diffuse high energy neutrinos produced in the\nMilky Way by the interaction of cosmic rays (CRs) with the interstellar medium\n(ISM). These comparative signals should be observable by large neutrino\ndetectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2008 13:32:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2008 15:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Contact and friction laws between deformable models are\noften simplified in up to date methods.

In this\nsituation, we use the methods of stochastic dynamic programming to create a\ndecentralized search method which attempts to minimize the total cost, rather\nthan the number of steps, of each path. We show that it succeeds in doing so\namong all decentralized search algorithms which monotonically approach the\ndestination. Our algorithm depends on knowing the expected cost of routing from\nevery vertex to any other, but we show that this may be calculated iteratively,\nand in practice can be easily estimated from the cost of previous routes and\ncompressed into a small routing table. The methods applied here can also be\napplied directly in other situations, such as efficient searching in graphs\nwith varying vertex degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2008 15:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-04"}

The\nresult, though satisfactory for most discrete MOPs, is at least from the\npractical viewpoint not sufficient for continuous models: in this case, the set\nof approximate solutions typically forms an $n$-dimensional object, where $n$\ndenotes the dimension of the parameter space, and thus, it may come to\nperfomance problems since in practise one has to cope with a finite archive.\nHere we focus on obtaining finite and tight approximations of $E_\\epsilon$, the\nlatter measured by the Hausdorff distance.

The imaginary time formalism allows one to monitor the system as\na function of temperature. The family of classical paths, saddle points for the\naction, is derived in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions whose periodicity\nsets the energy-temperature correspondence. The period of the classical\noscillations varies monotonically with the energy up to the sphaleron, pointing\nto a smooth crossover from the quantum to the activated regime. The softening\nof the quantum fluctuation spectrum is evaluated analytically by the theory of\nthe functional determinants and computed at low $T$ up to the crossover. In\nparticular, the negative eigenvalue, causing an imaginary contribution to the\npartition function, is studied in detail by solving the Lam\\`{e} equation which\ngoverns the fluctuation spectrum. For a heavvy particle mass, the decay rate\nshows a remarkable temperature dependence mainly ascribable to a low lying soft\nmode and, approaching the crossover, it increases by a factor five over the\npredictions of the zero temperature theory. Just beyond the peak value, the\nclassical Arrhenius behavior takes over. A similar trend is found studying the\nquartic metastable potential but the lifetime of the latter is longer by a\nfactor ten than in a cubic potential with same parameters. Some formal\nanalogies with noise-induced transitions in classically activated metastable\nsystems are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2008 15:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2008 17:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-22"}
