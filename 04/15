We first carefully\nre-examine the flavor constraints on the mass scale of new physics in the\nstandard Randall-Sundrum-type scenarios, and find that the KK gluon mass should\ngenerically be heavier than about 21 TeV. We then compare the flavor structure\nof the composite Higgs models to those in the RS model. We find new\ncontributions to flavor violation, which while still are suppressed by the\nRS-GIM mechanism, will enhance the amplitudes of flavor violations. In\nparticular, there is a kinetic mixing term among the SM fields which (although\nparametrically not enhanced) will make the flavor bounds even more stringent\nthan in RS. This together with the fact that in the pseudo-Goldstone scenario\nYukawa couplings are set by a gauge coupling implies the KK gluon mass to be at\nleast about 33 TeV. For both the RS and the composite Higgs models the flavor\nbounds could be stronger or weaker depending on the assumption on the value of\nthe gluon boundary kinetic term. These strong bounds seem to imply that the\nfully anarchic approach to flavor in warped extra dimensions is implausible,\nand there have to be at least some partial flavor symmetries appearing that\neliminate part of the sources for flavor violation. We also present complete\nexpressions for the radiatively generated Higgs potential of various 5D\nimplementations of the composite Higgs model, and comment on the 1-5 percent\nlevel tuning needed in the top sector to achieve a phenomenologically\nacceptable vacuum state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2008 19:49:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2008 17:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-06"}

Key results are that the temperature\nprofile depends only weakly on the heating distribution -- not sufficiently to\nbe of significant diagnostic value -- and that the scaling laws survive for\nthis wide range of heating distributions, but with the constant of\nproportionality in the RTV scaling law ($P_{0}L \\thicksim T_{max}^3$) depending\non the specific heating function. Furthermore, quasi-static analytical\nsolutions do not exist for an excessive concentration of heating near the loop\nfootpoints, a result in agreement with recent numerical simulations.

Owing to these\nphase slips low-dimensional superconductors acquire electrical resistance. In\nquasi-one-dimensional nanowires it is well known that at higher temperatures\nphase slips occur via the process of thermal barrier-crossing by the\norder-parameter field. At low temperatures, the general expectation is that\nphase slips should proceed via quantum tunnelling events, which are known as\nquantum phase slips (QPS). Here we report strong evidence for individual\nquantum tunnelling events undergone by the superconducting order-parameter\nfield in homogeneous nanowires.We accomplish this via measurements of the\ndistribution of switching currents-the high-bias currents at which\nsuperconductivity gives way to resistive behaviour-whose width exhibits a\nrather counter-intuitive, monotonic increase with decreasing temperature. We\noutline a stochastic model of phase slip kinetics which relates the basic phase\nslip rates to switching rates. Comparison with this model indicates that the\nphase predominantly slips via thermal activation at high temperatures but at\nsufficiently low temperatures switching is caused by individual topological\ntunnelling events of the order-parameter field, i.e., QPS. Importantly,\nmeasurements on several wires show that quantum fluctuations tend to dominate\nover thermal fluctuations at larger temperatures in wires having larger\ncritical currents. This fact provides strong supports the view that the\nanomalously high switching rates observed at low temperatures are indeed due to\nQPS, and not consequences of extraneous noise or hidden inhomogeneity of the\nwire.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2008 19:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 19:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Because of the crudeness of current\nmodels of intrinsic alignment, we have developed a model-independent, purely\ngeometrical method to remove shear-ellipticity correlations. We eliminate the\ncontributions to a tomographic cosmic shear signal that may be subject to\ncontamination by shear-ellipticity correlations, making use of the\ncharacteristic dependence of these correlations on redshift. By introducing an\nappropriately chosen weight function to the lensing efficiency that nulls\nsignals stemming from certain distances, new second-order measures of cosmic\nshear, free of intrinsic alignment, can be constructed. The loss of information\ninduced by this nulling technique and the subsequent degradation of constraints\non cosmological parameters is quantified in a likelihood analysis.

For a survey divided into 20 redshift bins\nwe find that the area of credible regions increases by 20% up to about 50%\nafter the application of nulling, depending on the cosmological parameters\nconsidered. We demonstrate that due to an optimization of the weight functions\nnearly all information is contained in a small subset of the new second-order\nmeasures.

We model scenarios where\nthese planets originate near the snow line in ``cold finger'' circumstellar\ndisks. Low-mass planet-planet scattering excites planets to low periastron\norbits only for lower mass stars. With long circularisation times, these\nplanets reside on long-period eccentric orbits. Closer formation regions mean\nplanets that reach short-period orbits by migration are most common around\nlow-mass stars. Above ~1 Solar mass, planets massive enough to migrate to\nclose-in orbits before the gas disk dissipates are above the critical mass for\ngas giant formation. Thus, there is an upper stellar mass limit for\nshort-period super-Earths that form by migration. If disk masses are\ndistributed as a power law, planet frequency increases with metallicity because\nmost disks have low masses. For disk masses distributed around a relatively\nhigh mass, planet frequency decreases with increasing metallicity. As icy\nplanets migrate, they shepherd interior objects toward the star, which grow to\n~1 Earth mass. In contrast to icy migrators, surviving shepherded planets are\nrocky. Upon reaching short-period orbits, planets are subject to evaporation\nprocesses. The closest planets may be reduced to rocky or icy cores.

Considering joint probabilities in the standard\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm (EPR-Bohm) setting for three observers, we use\nthis setting in order to play general three-player non-cooperative symmetric\ngames. We analyze how the peculiar non-factorizable joint probabilities\nprovided by the EPR-Bohm setting can change the outcome of a game, while\nrequiring that the quantum game attains a classical interpretation for\nfactorizable joint probabilities. In this framework, our analysis of the\nthree-player generalized Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) shows that the players can\nindeed escape from the classical outcome of the game, because of\nnon-factorizable joint probabilities that the EPR setting can provide. This\nsurprising result for three-player PD contrasts strikingly with our earlier\nresult for two-player PD, played in the same framework, in which even\nnon-factorizable joint probabilities do not result in escaping from the\nclassical consequence of the game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2008 05:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 08:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The spin relaxation time first increases and then\ndecreases with electric field, especially when the temperature is relatively\nlow. We show that $L$ valleys play the role of a ``drain'' of the total spin\npolarization due to the large spin-orbit coupling in $L$ valleys and the strong\n$\\Gamma$-$L$ inter-valley scattering, and thus can enhance spin relaxation of\nthe total system effectively when the in-plane electric field is high. Under\nelectric field, spin precession resulting from the electric-field-induced\nmagnetic field is observed. Meanwhile, due to the strong $\\Gamma$-$L$\ninter-valley scattering as well as the strong inhomogeneous broadening in $L$\nvalleys, electron spins in $L$ valleys possess almost the same damping rate and\nprecession frequency as those in $\\Gamma$ valley. This feature still holds when\na finite static magnetic field is applied in Voigt configuration, despite that\nthe $g$-factor of $L$ valleys is much larger than that of $\\Gamma$ valley.\nMoreover, it is shown that the property of spin precession of the whole system\nis dominated by electrons in $\\Gamma$ valley.

It will have an enormous impact on the election\nprocess making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote\nvoting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account\nsusceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most\nthe research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site\nelectronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they\ncannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform\nproblem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.\nThis paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic\nencryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques\nrecommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol\ntries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible\nfor manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper\nballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations\n(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,\nis performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme\nis characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the\nserver side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the\nvoter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2008 10:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-16"}

Extending earlier models,\na combined analytic and numerical approach is used to assess the effect of\nseveral complications, namely (i) a cell cannot detect a chemoattractant\ngradient directly but rather makes temporal comparisons of chemoattractant\nconcentration, (ii) the tumbles exhibit persistence of direction, meaning that\nthe swimming directions before and after a tumble are correlated, (iii) the\ncell suffers random re-orientations due to rotational Brownian motion, and (iv)\nthe non-spherical shape of the cell affects the way that it is rotated by the\nshear flow.

We explore a full range of parameters going from weak to strong\nelectron-vibration coupling, from tunneling to contact, from one-vibration\ndescription to the need of including all vibrations for a correct description\nof inelastic effects in transport. We explore the validity of single-site\nresonant models as well as its extension to more sites via molecular orbitals\nand the conditions under which multi-orbital, multi-vibrational descriptions\ncannot be simplified. We explain the physical meaning of the spectral features\nin the second derivative of the electron current with respect to the bias\nvoltage. This permits us to nuance the meaning of the energy value of dips and\npeaks. Finally, we show that finite-band effects lead to electron\nback-scattering off the molecular vibrations in the regime of high-conductance,\nalthough the drop in conductance at the vibrational threshold is rather due to\nthe rapid variation of the vibronic density of states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2008 12:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The presence of such a dense shell rich in SiO can be related\nwith that previously found for IRC+10420, which was also suggested to result\nfrom a shock. This may be a common feature in the evolution of these stars, as\na consequence of the episodic mass loss periods that they pass during their\nevolution.

The fast roll stage leads to a purely\nattractive potential for the curvature and tensor perturbations (this potential\nis purely repulsive in slowroll). This attractive potential depresses the CMB\nquadrupole moment for the curvature and B-mode spectra. A single new\ncosmological parameter emerges: the comoving wavenumber k_1 characteristic\nscale of this attractive potential.k_1 happens to exit the horizon precisely at\nthe transition from fast to slowroll.The fastroll stage dynamically modifies\nthe initial power spectrum by a transfer function D(k). We compute D(k) by\nsolving the inflaton evolution equations. D(k) suppresses the primordial power\nfor k < k_1 and enjoys the scaling property D(k) = Psi(k/k_1) where Psi(x) is\nan universal function. We perform a MCMC analysis of the WMAP/SDSS data\nincluding the fast-roll stage and find k_1 = 0.266/Gpc. The quadrupole mode k_Q\n= 0.242/Gpc exits the horizon 1/10 of an efold before k_1. We compare the\nfastroll fit with a fit with a sharp lower cutoff on the primordial power.\nFastroll provides a slightly better fit than a sharp cutoff for the TT,TE and\nEE modes.Moreover, our fits provide non-zero lower bounds for r, while for the\nother cosmological parameters we essentially get those of the LCDM model. The\nfact that k_Q exits the horizon before the slowroll stage implies an upper\nbound in the total number of efolds N_{tot} during inflation.Combining this\nwith estimates during the radiation dominated era we obtain N_{tot} ~ 66, with\nthe bounds 62 < N_{tot} < 82.We repeated the analysis with the\nWMAP-5/ACBAR-2007/SDSS data confirming the overall picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2008 13:35:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2008 13:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
