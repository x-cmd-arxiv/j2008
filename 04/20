In the first case, if the initial state is not the equilibrium state,\nthe intensity may switch periodically from fiber to fiber, while in the second\ncase the a-symmetrical state remains forever, with most of its energy in either\nfiber. The latter situation makes a state of propagation with two exactly\nreciprocal realizations. In the quantum case, such a situation does not exist\nas an eigenstate because of the quantum tunneling between the two fibers. Such\na tunneling is a purely quantum phenomenon which does not not exist in the\nclassical theory. We estimate the rate of tunneling by quantizing a simplified\ndynamics derived from the original Lagrangian equations with test functions.\nThis tunneling could be within reach of the experiments, particularly if the\nquantum coherence of the soliton can be maintained over a sufficient amount of\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Apr 2008 06:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The fact that the top quark is the heaviest elementary particle in\nthe Standard Model with a mass right at the electroweak scale makes it tempting\nto contemplate its role in electroweak symmetry breaking, as well as its\npotential as a window to unknown new physics at the TeV scale. We summarize the\nexpectations for top-quark physics at the LHC, and outline new physics\nscenarios in which the top quark is crucially involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Apr 2008 07:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-06"}

A general solution of the complex structure\nintegrability conditions is found in the context of the G{2,2) Grassmannian\nmanifold, which admits a global SL(4,C) symmetry group. A convenient definition\nof the physical energy and momentum permits the study of the vacuum and soliton\nsectors. The model has a set of conformally SU(2,2) invariant vacua and a set\nof Poincare invariant vacua. An algebraic integrability condition of the\ncomplex structure classifies the solitonic surfaces into three classes\n(families). The first class (spacetimes with two principal null directions)\ncontains the Kerr-Newman complex structure, which has fermionic (electron-like)\nproperties. That is the correct fermionic gyromagnetic ratio (g=2) and it\nsatisfies the correct electron equations of motion. The conjugate complex\nstructure determines the antisoliton, which has the same mass and opposite\ncharge. The fermionic solitons are differentiated from the complex structure\nbosonic modes by the periodicity condition on compactified spacetime. The\nnon-periodicity of the found solitonic complex structures is proved. The\nmodification of the Yang-Mills action has an essential consequence to the\nclassical potential. It generates a linear static potential instead of the\nCoulomb-like (1/r) potential of the ordinary Yang-Mills action. This linear\npotential implies that for every pure geometric soliton there are N solitonic\ngauge field excitations, which are perturbatively confined. The present model\nadvocates a solitonic unification scheme without supersymmetry and/or\nsuperstrings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Apr 2008 09:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-05"}
