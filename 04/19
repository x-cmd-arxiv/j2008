In the simulations the electrode behaves as an ideally\npolarizable hydrophilic metal, supporting image charge interactions with\ncharged species, and it is maintained at a constant electrical potential with\nrespect to the solution so that the model is a textbook representation of an\nelectrochemical interface through which no current is passing. We show how\nwater is strongly attracted to and ordered at the electrode surface. This\nordering is different to the structure that might be imagined from continuum\nmodels of electrode interfaces. Further, this ordering significantly affects\nthe probability of ions reaching the surface. We describe the concomitant\nmotion and configurations of the water and ions as functions of the electrode\npotential, and we analyze the length scales over which ionic atmospheres\nfluctuate. The statistics of these fluctuations depend upon surface structure\nand ionic strength. The fluctuations are large, sufficiently so that the mean\nionic atmosphere is a poor descriptor of the aqueous environment near a metal\nsurface. The importance of this finding for a description of electrochemical\nreactions is examined by calculating, directly from the simulation, Marcus free\nenergy profiles for transfer of charge between the electrode and a redox\nspecies in the solution and comparing the results with the predictions of\ncontinuum theories. Significant departures from the electrochemical textbook\ndescriptions of the phenomenon are found and their physical origins are\ncharacterized from the atomistic perspective of the simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2008 19:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-09"}

For example,\nthe timelessness of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be seen as resulting from\nusing Jacobi's principle to define the dynamics of 3-geometries through\nsuperspace. In addition, using Jacobi's principle for non-relativistic\nparticles is equivalent classically to Newton's theory but leads to a\ntime-independent Schrodinger equation upon Dirac quantization. In this paper,\nwe study the mechanism for the disappearance of time as a result of using\nJacobi's principle in these simple particle models. We find that the path\nintegral quantization very clearly elucidates the physical mechanism for the\ntimeless of the quantum theory as well as the emergence of duration at the\nclassical level. Physically, this is the result of a superposition of clocks\nwhich occurs in the quantum theory due to a sum over all histories.\nMathematically, the timelessness is related to how the gauge fixing functions\nimpose the boundary conditions in the path integral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2008 18:18:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 21:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2010 16:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

This in turn implies that the total deuterium abundance in the local\nGalactic disk could be as high as $\\sim 84 %$ of the primordial D abundance. It\nwas proposed that the infall/accretion of pristine gas is needed to explain\nsuch a high deuterium abundance.

Thus, the overall plasma evolution we observe in these\nfeatures could be the cumulative result of numerous individual strands\nundergoing sporadic heating. This paper presents a short (10^9 cm ~ 10 Mm)\n``global loop'' as 125 individual strands where each strand is modelled\nindependently by a one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation. The energy release\nmechanism across the strands consists of localised, discrete heating events\n(nano-flares). The strands are ``coupled'' together through the frequency\ndistribution of the total energy input to the loop which follows a power law\ndistribution with index alpha. The location and lifetime of each energy event\noccurring is random. Although a typical strand can go through a series of\nwell-defined heating/cooling cycles, when the strands are combined, the overall\nquasi-static emission measure weighted thermal profile for the global loop\nreproduces a hot apex/cool base structure. Localised cool plasma blobs are seen\nto travel along individual strands which could cause the loop to `disappear'\nfrom coronal emission and appear in transition or chromospheric ones. As alpha\nincreases (from 0 to 2.29 to 3.29), more weight is given to the smallest\nheating episodes. Consequently, the overall global loop apex temperature\nincreases while the variation of the temperature around that value decreases.\nAny further increase in alpha saturates the loop apex temperature variations at\nthe current simulation resolution. The effect of increasing the number of\nstrands and the loop length as well as the implications of these results upon\npossible future observing campaigns for TRACE and Hinode are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2008 21:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This indicates that the system is closely\nrelated to WZ Sge stars and SU UMa stars having short orbital periods. For CTCV\nJ0549-4921, the candidates of the mean superhump period are 0.083249(10) days\nand 0.084257(8) days, respectively. Due to a lack of the observations, we\ncannot determine the true superhump period, but the latter period is favorable.\nUsing the ASAS-3 archive, it turned out that the system shows only four\noutbursts over the past 6 years. The outburst amplitude of CTCV J0549-4921 was\nrelatively small, with about 4.5 mag. One possibility is that mass evaporation\nmay play a role during quiescence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Apr 2008 06:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Circular polarization and intensity spectra of the\nH$\\alpha$ spectral line demonstrate the presence of two-component magnetic\nfield in the photosphere of this star. The geometry consists of a weak, large\nscale component, and a strong, localized component. Analyzing the rotationally\nmodulated low-field component, we establish a rotation period $P_{rot} = 1.4480\n\\pm 0.0001$ days. Modeling the measured magnetic observables, we find that the\nlow-field component can be described by the superposition of a dipole and\nquadrupole.

The dipole strength at the pole is about 180 kG, and the quadrupolar\nstrength is about 230 kG. These data suggest a fossil origin of the low-field\ncomponent. In contrast, the strong-field component exhibits a peculiar,\nlocalized structure (``magnetic spot'') that confirms the conclusions of Maxted\nand co-workers. The mean field modulus of the spot ($|B_{spot}| = 520 \\pm 7$\nkG) together with its variable longitudinal magnetic field having a maximum of\nabout +400 kG make it difficult to describe it naturally as a high-order\ncomponent of the star's global poloidal field.

The present\nexperimental data base for this reaction is large, but contains a large\ndiscrepancy between data sets for the differential cross section taken at 135\nMeV/nucleon by two experimental research groups. This paper reviews the\nbackground of this problem and presents new data taken at KVI. Differential\ncross sections and analyzing powers for the $^{2}{\\rm H}(\\vec p,d){p}$ and\n${\\rm H}(\\vec d,d){p}$ reactions at 135 MeV/nucleon and 65 MeV/nucleon,\nrespectively, have been measured. The data differ significantly from previous\nmeasurements and consistently follow the energy dependence as expected from an\ninterpolation of published data taken over a large range at intermediate\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Apr 2008 13:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The characterisation of the packed\nconfiguration is made possible by using refined image analysis. The geometrical\nproperties and energies of the branches forming the cross-section are broadly\ndistributed. We find distributions of energy with exponential tails. This setup\nnaturally divides the system into two sub-systems: in contact with the\ncontainer and within the bulk. While the geometrical properties of the\nsub-systems differ, their energy distributions are identical, indicating\n'thermal' homogeneity and allowing the definition of effective temperatures\nfrom the characteristic scales of the energy distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Apr 2008 14:34:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2008 19:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
