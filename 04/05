As a\nconsequence of the attractive interaction, fermions form a condensate that\nspontaneously breaks the U(1) symmetry associated with total number\nconservation. Therefore at sufficiently small temperatures and asymmetries, the\nsystem is a superfluid. We reproduce previous results for the stability\nconditions of the system as a function of the four-fermion coupling and\nasymmetry. We obtain these results analyzing the coefficients of the low energy\neffective Lagrangian of the modes describing fluctuations in the magnitude\n(Higgs mode) and in the phase (Goldstone mode) of the difermion condensate. We\nfind that for certain values of parameters, the mass of the Higgs mode\ndecreases with increasing mismatch between the chemical potentials of the two\npopulations, if we keep the scattering length and the gap parameter constant.\nFurthermore, we find that the energy cost for creating a position dependent\nfluctuation of the condensate is constant in the gapped region and increases in\nthe gapless region. These two features may lead to experimentally detectable\neffects. As an example, we argue that if the superfluid is put in rotation, the\nsquare of the radius of the outer core of a vortex should sharply increase on\nincreasing the asymmetry, when we pass through the relevant region in the\ngapless superfluid phase.

The information about the radiated field in the\nCFT sector is contained in the central charge, whereas in the radiation tensor\nthis information is in the statistical distribution. This result allows to\ndetermine the radiation of scalar and Dirac fields easily and without the\nnecessity of solving the corresponding Klein-Gordon or Dirac equation in a\ncurved spacetime. In both cases, the correct temperature was obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2008 17:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-07"}

A fixed-rate\ncommunication system is considered. It is known from the literature that with\nerror-free feedback, the outage-optimal quantizer for power control has a\ncircular structure. Moreover, the diversity gain of the system increases\npolynomially with the cardinality of the power control codebook. Here, a\nsimilar system is studied, but when the feedback link is error-prone.

Furthermore, the optimal power control codebook\nresembles a channel optimized scalar quantizer (COSQ), i.e., the Voronoi\nregions merge with erroneous feedback information.

Photometric and kinematic observations suggest that\nNGC 205 is undergoing tidal distortion from its interaction with M31. Despite\nearlier attempts, the orbit and progenitor properties of NGC 205 are not well\nknown. We perform an optimized search for these unknowns by combining a genetic\nalgorithm with restricted N-body simulations of the interaction. This approach,\ncoupled with photometric and kinematic observations as constraints, allows for\nan effective exploration of the parameter space. We represent NGC 205 as a\nstatic Hernquist potential with embedded massless test particles that serve as\ntracers of surface brightness. We explore 3 distinct, initially stable\nconfigurations of test particles: cold rotating disk, warm rotating disk, and\nhot, pressure-supported spheroid. Each model reproduces some, but not all, of\nthe observed features of NGC 205, leading us to speculate that a rotating\nprogenitor with substantial pressure support could match all of the\nobservables. Furthermore, plausible combinations of mass and scale length for\nthe pressure-supported spheroid progenitor model reproduce the observed\nvelocity dispersion profile. For all 3 models, orbits that best match the\nobservables place the satellite 11+/-9 kpc behind M31 moving at very large\nvelocities: 300-500 km/s on primarily radial orbits. Given that the observed\nradial component is only 54 km/s, this implies a large tangential motion for\nNGC 205, moving from the NW to the SE. These results suggest NGC 205 is not\nassociated with the stellar arc observed to the NE of NGC 205. Furthermore, NGC\n205's velocity appears to be near or greater than its escape velocity,\nsignifying that the satellite is likely on its first M31 passage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2008 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Given spatial\ninterference cancelation, the network transmission capacity is analyzed in this\npaper, which is defined as the maximum transmitting node density under\nconstraints on outage and the signal-to-interference-noise ratio. Assuming the\nPoisson distribution for the locations of network nodes and spatially i.i.d.\nRayleigh fading channels, mathematical tools from stochastic geometry are\napplied for deriving scaling laws for transmission capacity.

Exhibiting magnetic field strengths well in\nexcess of a TeraGauss, such compact astrophysical environments permit the\naction of exotic mechanisms that are forbidden by symmetries in field-free\nregions. Foremost among these processes are single-photon pair creation, where\na photon converts to an electron-positron pair, and magnetic photon splitting,\nwhere a single photon divides into two of lesser energy via the coupling to the\nexternal field. The pair conversion process is exponentially small in weak\nfields, and provides the leading order contribution to vacuum polarization. In\ncontrast, photon splitting possesses no energy threshold and can operate in\nkinematic regimes where the lower order pair conversion is energetically\nforbidden. This paper outlines some of the key physical aspects of these\nprocesses, and highlights their manifestation in neutron star magnetospheres.\nAnticipated observational signatures include profound absorption turnovers in\npulsar spectra at gamma-ray wavelengths. The shapes of these turnovers provide\ndiagnostics on the possible action of pair creation and the geometrical locale\nof the photon emission region. There is real potential for the first\nconfirmation of strong field QED with the new GLAST mission, to be launched by\nNASA in 2008. Suppression of pair creation by photon splitting and its\nimplications for pulsars is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2008 02:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Recent advances in imaging have allowed for the\nmonitoring of axonal, dendritic, and synapse dynamics in vivo. It is observed\nthat the majority of axonal and dendritic branches are formed 'in error', only\nto be retracted later. The functional significance of the overproduction of\nbranches is not clear. In this study, we use a computational model to\ninvestigate the speed and efficiency of different branching strategies. We show\nthat branching itself allows for substantial acceleration in the identification\nof appropriate targets through the use of a parallel search. We also show that\nthe formation of new branches in the vicinity of existing synapses leads to the\nformation of target connectivity with a decreased number of erroneous branches.\nThis finding allows us to explain the high correlation between the branch\npoints and synapses observed in the Xenopus laevis retinotectal system. We also\nsuggest that the most efficient branching rule is different for axons and\ndendrites. The optimal axonal strategy is to form new branches in the vicinity\nof existing synapses, whereas the optimal rule for dendrites is to form new\nbranches preferentially in the vicinity of synapses with correlated pre- and\npostsynaptic electric activity. Thus, our studies suggest that the developing\nneural system employs a set of sophisticated computational strategies that\nfacilitate the formation of required circuitry, so that it may proceed in the\nfastest and most frugal way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2008 05:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-08"}

This also raises the\nproblem of the dependence of the Yaglom quasistationary distributions on the\ninitial number of particles and the asymptotic behavior of the Q-process\nassociated with a subcritical BPRE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2008 13:28:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2008 17:07:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 09:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-10"}

At\nweakly attractive surfaces, a lubrication layer forms, $\\delta$ is large and\nincreases upon cooling. Close to the glass transition temperature, $T_ g$, very\nlarge slip lengths are observed. At a more attractive surface, a``stick y\nsurface layer\" is build up, which gives rise to a small slip length.

At strongly attractive surfaces, the Navier-slip\ncondit ion fails to describe Couette and Poiseuille flow simultaneously.

In\nthis paper, we present new 3.6 cm observations taken 2.68 years after the first\nepoch that allow a search for variability and proper motions, as well as the\ndetection of additional faint sources in the region. We do not detect proper\nmotions along the axis of the outflow in the outer lobes of this source at a\n4-$\\sigma$ upper limit of $\\sim$160 km s$^{-1}$. This suggests that these lobes\nare probably working surfaces where the jet is interacting with a denser\nmedium. However, the brightest components of the lobes show evidence of\nprecession, at a rate of $0\\rlap.^\\circ08$ yr$^{-1}$ clockwise in the plane of\nthe sky. It may be possible to understand the distribution of almost all the\nidentified sources as the result of ejecta from a precessing jet. The core of\nthe thermal jet shows significant variations in flux density and morphology. We\ncompare this source with other jets in low and high mass young stars and\nsuggest that the former can be understood as a scaled-up version of the latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2008 14:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
