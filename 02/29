For nucleon-nucleon scattering, the\nnegativity of some of the low-energy interactions signals the presence of a\nspin-1 bound state: the deuteron. We connect the divergence of the dispersion\nintegral to the \"Sommerfeld enhancement\" of the cross-section for low-energy\nscattering.

Different components\nand/or aspects of real-world financial markets are modelled by these games. In\nthe MG, agents compete for scarce resources; in the MAJG gents imitate the\ngroup in the hope of exploiting a trend; in the $G agents attempt to\nsuccessfully predict and benefit from trends as well as changes in the\ndirection of a market. It has been previously shown that in the MG for a\nreasonable number of preliminary time steps preceding equilibrium (Time Horizon\nMG, THMG), agents' attempt to optimize their gains by active strategy selection\nis ``illusory'': The calculated hypothetical gains of their individual\nstrategies is greater on average than agents' actual average gains.\nFurthermore, if a small proportion of agents deliberately choose and act in\naccord with their seemingly worst performing strategy, these outper-form all\nother agents on average, and even attain mean positive gain, otherwise rare for\nagents in the MG. This latter phenomenon raises the question as to how well the\noptimization procedure works in the MAJG and $G. We demonstrate that the\nillusion of control is absent in MAJG and $G. In other words, low-entropy (more\ninformative) strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies in\nthe MG but outperform them in the MAJG and $G. This provides further\nclarification of the kinds of situations subject to genuine control, and those\nnot, in set-ups a priori defined to emphasize the importance of optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2008 17:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Paramount among these are those relating to the nature of\nthe origin of the universe and its early evolution. Regarding the question of\norigin, the main difficulty has been the fact that within the classical general\nrelativistic framework, the `origin' is almost always a singular event at which\nthe laws of physics break down, thus making it impossible for such an event, or\nepochs prior to it, to be studied. Recent studies have shown that Loop Quantum\nCosmology may provide a non-singular framework where these questions can be\naddressed. The crucial role here is played by quantum effects, i.e.\\\ncorrections to the classical equations of motion, which are incorporated in\neffective equations employed to develop cosmological scenarios.\n  In this chapter we shall consider the three main types of quantum effects\nexpected to be present within such a framework and discuss some of their\nconsequences for the effective equations. In particular we discuss how such\ncorrections can allow the construction of non-singular emergent scenarios for\nthe origin of the universe, which are past-eternal, oscillating and naturally\nemerge into an inflationary phase. These scenarios provide a physically\nplausible picture for the origin and early phases of the universe, which is in\nprinciple testable. We pay special attention to the interplay between these\ndifferent types of correction terms. Given the absence, so far, of a complete\nderivation of such corrections in general settings, it is important to bear in\nmind the questions of consistency and robustness of scenarios based on partial\ninclusion of such effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2008 20:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-29"}

We compare our measurements with the predicted evolution of dark matter\nclustering and use the halo model to interpret our results. We find that our\nclustering measurements are inconsistent (>99.9% significance) with a passive\nmodel whereby the LRGs do not merge with one another; a model with a merger\nrate of 7.5 +/- 2.3% from z = 0.55 to z = 0.19 (i.e. an average rate of 2.4%\nGyr^-1) provides a better fit to our observations. Our clustering and number\ndensity measurements are consistent with the hypothesis that the merged LRGs\nwere originally central galaxies in different haloes which, following the\nmerger of these haloes, merged to create a single Brightest Cluster Galaxy. In\naddition, we show that the small-scale clustering signal constrains the scatter\nin halo merger histories. When combined with measurements of the luminosity\nfunction, our results suggest that this scatter is sub-Poisson. While this is a\ngeneric prediction of hierarchical models, it has not been tested before.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2008 21:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 May 2008 16:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Unlike the conventional beamforming\nschemes in which beamforming is implemented solely by the base station (BS) in\na per-subcarrier fashion, the proposed schemes take advantages of a novel\nchannel decomposition technique to perform beamforming jointly by the BS and\nthe mobile terminal (MT). The resulting beamforming schemes allow the BS to\nemploy only {\\em one} beamforming matrix (BFM) to form beams for {\\em all}\nsubcarriers while each MT completes the beamforming task for each subcarrier\nlocally. Consequently, for a MIMO-OFDMA system with $Q$ subcarriers, the\nproposed opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes require only one BFM\nindex and $Q$ supportable throughputs to be returned from each MT to the BS, in\ncontrast to $Q$ BFM indices and $Q$ supportable throughputs required by the\nconventional schemes. The advantage of the proposed schemes becomes more\nevident when a further feedback reduction is achieved by grouping adjacent\nsubcarriers into exclusive clusters and returning only cluster information from\neach MT.

We report\nnew detections of group-scale environments around three radio galaxies, 3C 296,\nNGC 1044 and 3C 76.1. As with previous studies, we find that FR-I radio\ngalaxies inhabit group environments ranging over nearly two orders of magnitude\nin bolometric X-ray luminosity, but find no evidence for a tight relationship\nbetween large-scale X-ray environment and radio-source properties such as size,\nradio luminosity, and axial ratio. We confirm earlier work showing that\nequipartition internal pressures are typically lower than the external\npressures acting on the radio lobes, so that additional non-radiating particles\nmust be present or the lobes must be magnetically dominated. We present the\nfirst direct observational evidence that entrainment may provide this missing\npressure, in the form of a relationship between radio-source structure and\napparent pressure imbalance. Finally, our study provides further support for\nthe presence of an apparent temperature excess in radio-loud groups compared to\nthe group population as a whole. For five of eight temperature excesses, the\nenergy required to inflate the radio lobes is comparable to the energy required\nto produce this excess by heating of the group gas; however, in three cases the\ncurrent radio source appears too weak to produce the temperature excess. It\nremains unclear whether the temperature excess can be directly associated with\nthe current phase of AGN activity, or whether it is instead either a signature\nof previous AGN activity or simply an indicator of the particular set of group\nproperties most conducive to the growth of an FR-I radio galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2008 21:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In\nparticular, it has been demonstrated that significant performance improvement\ncan be achieved by incorporating low-complexity linear combining techniques\ninto the design of OS schemes for MIMO-SDMA. However, this previous analysis\nwas performed based on the effective signal-to-interference ratio (SIR),\nassuming an interference-limited scenario, which is typically a valid\nassumption in SDMA-based systems. It was shown that the limiting distribution\nof the effective SIR is of the Frechet type.

The convergence of the limiting distribution of the effective\nSINR to the Gumbel type is established. The resulting scaling law is found to\nbe governed by the conventional $\\log\\log K$ form.

Based on\nthe fact that electric polarization undergoes spiral orientation as one moves\nfrom one domain to the other, it is assumed that at low temperatures the spins\nat and near domain walls undergo relaxation due to possible easy reorientation\nof electric polarization in domain walls even though such a relaxation in the\nmain body of the domain has almost ceased. The spins present inside the domain\nundergo relaxation through transfer of magnetization to the domain walls\nthrough a spin diffusion process by nearest neighbour interaction. Rate\nequations for spin populations are formed by representing the ferroelectric\ndomain by a one-dimensional chain of equidistant spins having dipolar coupling.\nSpin populations are calculated as a function of time for different ratios of\nquadrupolar to dipolar transition probabilities for a sample subjected to\nselective rf pulse.

In this work, we generalise this result to different\nentanglement loss functions, notably including the entanglement of formation\nloss, and prove that many inequivalent entanglement measures lead to equivalent\nconditions for approximate quantum error correction. In doing this, we show how\ndifferent measures of bipartite entanglement give rise to corresponding\ndistance-like functions between quantum channels, and we investigate how these\ninduced distances are related to the cb-norm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Feb 2008 06:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jun 2008 03:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-06"}

We find that the magnetic edge states of the Dirac fermions,\nformed along the boundary between the two domains, have features strongly\ndependent on whether $B_0$ is parallel or antiparallel to $B_1$. In the\nparallel case, when the Zeeman spin splitting can be ignored, the magnetic edge\nstates originating from the $n=0$ Landau levels of the two domains have\ndispersionless energy levels, contrary to those from the $n \\ne 0$ levels.\nHere, $n$ is the graphene Landau-level index. They become dispersive as the\nZeeman splitting becomes finite or as an electrostatic step potential is\nadditionally applied. In the antiparallel case, the $n=0$ magnetic edge states\nsplit into electron-like and hole-like current-carrying states. The energy gap\nbetween the electron-like and hole-like states can be created by the Zeeman\nsplitting or by the step potential.

This is especially true in the field of chemical reactions where the\nabilities to form bonds between different types of atoms and molecules create\nmuch of the properties we experience in our everyday life, especially in all\nbiological activity. There are essentially two types of processes related to\nbiochemical reaction networks, the interactions among molecules and\ninteractions involving their conformational changes, so in a sense, their\ninternal state. The first type of processes can be conveniently approximated by\nthe so-called mass-action kinetics, but this is not necessarily so for the\nsecond kind where molecular states do not define any kind of density or\nconcentration. In this paper we demonstrate the necessity to study reaction\nnetworks in a stochastic formulation for which we can construct a coherent\napproximation in terms of specific space-time scales and the number of\nparticles. The continuum limit procedure naturally creates equations of\nFokker-Planck type where the evolution of the concentration occurs on a slower\ntime scale when compared to the evolution of the conformational changes, for\nexample triggered by binding or unbinding events with other (typically smaller)\nmolecules. We apply the asymptotic theory to derive the effective, i.e.\nmacroscopic dynamics of the biochemical reaction system. The theory can also be\napplied to other processes where entities can be described by finitely many\ninternal states, with changes of states occuring by arrival of other entities\ndescribed by a birth-death process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Feb 2008 11:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-03"}

In this process, usually called adiabatic connection,\nthe one-electron density is (ideally) kept fixed by a suitable local one-body\npotential. While an accurate intracule density of the physical system can only\nbe obtained from expensive wavefunction-based calculations, being able to\nconstruct good models starting from Kohn-Sham ingredients would highly improve\nthe accuracy of density functional calculations. To this purpose, we\ninvestigate the intracule density in the $\\lambda\\to\\infty$ limit of the\nadiabatic connection. This strong-interaction limit of density functional\ntheory turns out to be, like the opposite non-interacting Kohn-Sham limit,\nmathematically simple and can be entirely constructed from the knowledge of the\none-electron density. We develop here the theoretical framework and, using\naccurate correlated one-electron densities, we calculate the intracule\ndensities in the strong interaction limit for few atoms. Comparison of our\nresults with the corresponding Kohn-Sham and physical quantities provides\nuseful hints for building approximate intracule densities along the adiabatic\nconnection of density functional theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Feb 2008 12:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

To\ncircumvent this problem when analyzing data it is usual to assume flatness to\nconstrain DE, or conversely, to assume that DE is a cosmological constant to\nconstrain curvature. In this paper, we quantify the impact of such assumptions\nin view of future large surveys. We simulate future data for type Ia Supernovae\n(SNIa), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations\n(BAO) for a large range of fiducial cosmologies allowing a small spatial\ncurvature. We take into account a possible time evolution of DE through a\nparameterized equation of state : $w(a) = w_0 + (1-a) w_a$. We then fit the\nsimulated data with a wrong assumption on the curvature or on the DE\nparameters. For a fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, if flatness is incorrectly\nassumed in the fit and if the true curvature is within the ranges\n$0.01<\\Omega_k<0.03$ and $-0.07<\\Omega_k<-0.01$, one will conclude erroneously\nto the presence of an evolving DE, even with high statistics. On the other\nhand, models with curvature and dynamical DE can be confused with a flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM model when the fit ignores a possible DE evolution. We find that,\nin the future, with high statistics, such risks of confusion should be limited,\nbut they are still possible, and biases on the cosmological parameters might be\nimportant. We conclude on recalling that, in the future, it will be mandatory\nto perform some complete multi-probes analyses, leaving the DE parameters as\nwell as the curvature as free parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Feb 2008 14:56:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 11:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

This suggests that for a wide range of radii, MHD turbulence can\nonly be sustained in the surface layers where the ionisation fraction is\nsufficiently high. A dead zone is expected to exist near the midplane, such\nthat active accretion only occurs near the upper and lower disc surfaces.\nRecent work, however, suggests that under suitable conditions the dead zone may\nbe enlivened by turbulent transport of ions from the surface layers into the\ndense interior.\n  In this paper we present a suite of simulations that examine where, and under\nwhich conditions, a dead zone can be enlivened by turbulent mixing. We use\nthree-dimensional, multifluid shearing box MHD simulations, which include\nvertical stratification, ionisation chemistry, ohmic resistivity, and\nionisation due to X-rays from the central protostar. We compare the results of\nthe MHD simulations with a simple reaction-diffusion model.\n  The simulations show that in the absence of gas-phase heavy metals, such as\nmagnesium, turbulent mixing has essentially no effect on the dead zone. The\naddition of a relatively low abundance of magnesium, however, increases the\nrecombination time and allows turbulent mixing of ions to enliven the dead zone\ncompletely beyond a distance of 5 AU from the central star, for our particular\ndisc model. During the late stages of protoplanetary disc evolution, when small\ngrains have been depleted and the disc surface density has decreased below its\nhigh initial value, the structure of the dead zone may be significantly altered\nby the action of turbulent transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Feb 2008 15:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In various relevant cases the\nequilibrium distribution is the same for all these models, namely a\ngamma-distribution with suitably defined temperature and number of dimensions.\nThis in turn allows one to quantify the inequalities observed in the wealth\ndistributions and suggests that their origin should be traced back to very\ngeneral underlying mechanisms: for instance, it follows that the smaller the\nfraction of the relevant quantity (e.g. wealth or energy) that agents can\nexchange during an interaction, the closer the corresponding equilibrium\ndistribution is to a fair distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Feb 2008 15:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Second we prove Marsaglia's polar method extends to this\ndistribution, providing a simple, exact, robust and efficient\nacceptance-rejection method for generalized Gaussian sampling and thus central\nchi-square sampling. Third we derive a simple, high-accuracy, robust and\nefficient direct inversion method for generalized Gaussian sampling based on\nthe Beasley-Springer-Moro method. Indeed the accuracy of the approximation to\nthe inverse cumulative distribution function is to the tenth decimal place. We\nthen apply our methods to non-central chi-square variance sampling in the\nHeston model. We focus on the case when the number of degrees of freedom is\nsmall and the zero boundary is attracting and attainable, typical in foreign\nexchange markets. Using the additivity property of the chi-square distribution,\nour methods apply in all parameter regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Feb 2008 15:45:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2009 15:29:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2010 16:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 13:26:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 12:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

This is a monolayer of graphite, and the two-dimensional electrons\nand holes in it are described by the effective Dirac equation with a vanishing\neffective mass. As a consequence, electromagnetic response of graphene is\npredicted to be strongly non-linear. We develop a quasi-classical kinetic\ntheory of the non-linear electromagnetic response of graphene, taking into\naccount the self-consistent-field effects. Response of the system to both\nharmonic and pulse excitation is considered. The frequency multiplication\neffect, resulting from the non-linearity of the electromagnetic response, is\nstudied under realistic experimental conditions. The frequency up-conversion\nefficiency is analysed as a function of the applied electric field and\nparameters of the samples. Possible applications of graphene in terahertz\nelectronics are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Feb 2008 15:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
