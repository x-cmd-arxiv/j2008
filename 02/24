According to this classification these fields can belong to\nthree types (electric, magnetic and null), each of them being split in pure and\nimpure subtypes. Only pure null type field propagates with the fundamental\nvelocity $c$, all other fields have the propagation velocity less than that of\nlight. The reference-frame-based methods of elimination of alternative\nthree-fields (e.g., magnetic in the electric type case) are given for pure\nsubtypes; for pure null type the generalized Doppler effect takes place\ninstead. All three types of impure fields are shown to be {\\bf E}-{\\bf\nB}-parallelizable.

To\ndevelop a theoretical construction that will aid in physically understanding\nthe relationship of known two-dimensional vortex dynamics to their\nthree-dimensional counterparts in Keplerian disks. Using asymptotic scaling\narguments varicose disturbances of a Keplerian disk are considered on radial\nand vertical scales consistent with the height of the disk while the azimuthal\nscales are the full $2\\pi$ angular extent of the disk. The scalings lead to\ndynamics which are radially geostrophic and vertically hydrostatic. It follows\nthat a potential vorticity quantity emerges and is shown to be conserved in a\nLagrangian sense. Uniform potential vorticity linear solutions are explored and\nthe theory is shown to contain an incarnation of the strato-rotational\ninstability under channel flow conditions. Linearized solutions of a single\ndefect on an infinite domain is developed and is shown to support a propagating\nRossby edgewave. Linear non-uniform potential vorticity solutions are also\ndeveloped and are shown to be similar in some respects to the dynamics of\nstrictly two-dimensional inviscid flows. Based on the framework of this theory,\narguments based on geophysical notions are presented to support the assertion\nthat the strato-rotational instability is in a generic class of\nbarotropic/baroclinic potential vorticity instabilities.

To address this need, MIMO techniques, which are\ncapable of offering several-fold increase in capacity, hold significant\npromise. Most previous work on capacity analysis of ad-hoc networks is based on\nan implicit assumption that each node has only one antenna. Core to the\nanalysis therein is the characterization of a geometric area, referred to as\nthe exclusion region, which quantizes the amount of spatial resource occupied\nby a link. When multiple antennas are deployed at each node, however, multiple\nlinks can transmit in the vicinity of each other simultaneously, as\ninterference can now be suppressed by spatial signal processing. As such, a\nlink no longer exclusively occupies a geometric area, making the concept of\n\"exclusion region\" not applicable any more. In this paper, we investigate\nlink-layer throughput capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks. In contrast to previous\nwork, the amount of spatial resource occupied by each link is characterized by\nthe actual interference it imposes on other links. To calculate the link-layer\ncapacity, we first derive the probability distribution of post-detection SINR\nat a receiver. The result is then used to calculate the number of active links\nand the corresponding data rates that can be sustained within an area. Our\nanalysis will serve as a guideline for the design of medium access protocols\nfor MIMO ad-hoc networks. To the best of knowledge, this paper is the first\nattempt to characterize the capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks by considering the\nactual PHY-layer signal and interference model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2008 05:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-26"}

The mesonic\nmean field obeys the classical non-linear Klein-Gordon equation with a\nmodification due to the coupling to mesonic quasi-particle excitations which\nare expressed in terms of the Wigner functions of the quantum fluctuations of\nthe meson field, namely the statistical average of the bilinear forms of the\nmeson creation and annihilation operators.

A simplified model of jet power from active galactic nuclei is proposed\nin which the relationship between jet power and disk luminosity is discussed by\ncombining disk accretion with two mechanisms of extracting energy magnetically\nfrom a black hole accretion disk, i.e., the Blandford-Payne (BP) and the\nBlandford-Znajek (BZ) processes.\n  Methods. By including the BP process into the conservation laws of mass,\nangular momentum and energy, we derive the expressions of the BP power and disk\nluminosity, and the jet power is regarded as the sum of the BZ and BP powers.\n  Results. We find that the disk radiation flux and luminosity decrease because\na fraction of the accretion energy is channelled into the outflow/jet in the BP\nprocess. It is found that the dominant cooling mode of the accretion disk is\ndetermined mainly by how the poloidal magnetic field decreases with the\ncylindrical radius of the jet. By using the parameter space we found, which\nconsists of the black hole spin and the self-similar index of the configuration\nof the poloidal magnetic field frozen in the disk, we were able to compare the\nrelative importance of the following quantities related to the jet production:\n(1) the BP power versus the disk luminosity, (2) the BP power versus the BZ\npower, and (3) the jet power versus the disk luminosity.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of such waves are\npresented. We consider wave generation in the network due to two separate\nprocesses: (a) by transverse motions at the base of the flux tube; and (b) by\nthe absorption of acoustic waves generated in the ambient medium. We find that\nthe former mechanism leads to an efficient heating of the chromosphere by slow\nmagnetoacoustic waves propagating along magnetic field lines. This heating is\nproduced by shock waves with a horizontal size of a few hundred kilometers. In\ncontrast, acoustic waves excited in the ambient medium are converted into\ntransverse fast modes that travel rapidly through the flux tube and do not form\nshocks, unless the acoustic sources are located within 100 km from the tube\naxis.
