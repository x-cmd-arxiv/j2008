This extended Hubbard model on a\ntriangular lattice has been studied mostly in the strong coupling limit for\nonly a few types of instabilities. Using the extended two-particle self\nconsistent approach (ETPSC), that is valid at weak to intermediate coupling, we\npresent an unbiased study of the density and interaction dependent crossover\ndiagram for spin and charge density wave instabilities of the normal state at\narbitrary wave vector. When $U$ dominates over $V$ and electron filling is\nlarge, instabilities are chiefly in the spin sector and are controlled mostly\nby Fermi surface properties. Increasing $V$ eventually leads to charge\ninstabilities. In the latter case, it is mostly the wave vector dependence of\nthe vertex that determines the wave vector of the instability rather than Fermi\nsurface properties. At small filling, non-trivial instabilities appear only\nbeyond the weak coupling limit. There again, charge density wave instabilities\nare favored over a wide range of dopings by large $V$ at wave vectors\ncorresponding to $\\sqrt(3) \\times \\sqrt(3)$ superlattice in real space.\nCommensurate fillings do not play a special role for this instability.\nIncreasing $U$ leads to competition with ferromagnetism. At negative values of\n$U$ or $V$, neglecting superconducting fluctuations, one finds that charge\ninstabilities are favored. In general, the crossover diagram presents a rich\nvariety of instabilities. We also show that thermal charge-density wave\nfluctuations in the renormalized classical regime can open a pseudogap in the\nsingle-particle spectral weight, just as spin or superconducting fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2008 18:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our analysis implies that the properties of the PAHs are remarkably\nuniversal throughout our sample and at different spatial scales. In addition,\nthe relative variations of the band ratios, as large as one order of magnitude,\nare mainly controled by the fraction of ionized PAHs. In particular, I show\nthat we can rule out both the modification of the PAH size distribution and the\nmid-IR extinction, as an explanation of these variations. High values of the\nI(6.2)/I(11.3) ratio are found to be associated with the far-UV illuminated\nsurface of PDRs, at the scale of an interstellar cloud, and associated with\nstar formation activity, at the scale of a galaxy.

An important application of consensus methods is to\ncombine gene trees to estimate a species tree. To investigate the theoretical\nproperties of consensus trees that would be obtained from large numbers of loci\nevolving according to a basic evolutionary model, we construct consensus trees\nfrom independent gene trees that occur in proportion to gene tree probabilities\nderived from coalescent theory. We consider majority-rule, rooted triple (R*),\nand greedy consensus trees constructed from known gene trees, both in the\nasymptotic case as numbers of gene trees approach infinity and for finite\nnumbers of genes. Our results show that for some combinations of species tree\nbranch lengths, increasing the number of independent loci can make the\nmajority-rule consensus tree more likely to be at least partially unresolved\nand the greedy consensus tree less likely to match the species tree. However,\nthe probability that the R* consensus tree has the species tree topology\napproaches 1 as the number of gene trees approaches infinity. Although the\ngreedy consensus algorithm can be the quickest to converge on the correct\nspecies tree when increasing the number of gene trees, it can also be\npositively misleading. The majority-rule consensus tree is not a misleading\nestimator of the species tree topology, and the R* consensus tree is a\nstatistically consistent estimator of the species tree topology.

Preliminary\nobservational findings suggest a deficiency of short-period hot Jupiters around\nthe observed post MS stars, although the total fraction of them with known\nplanets appears to increase with their mass.

As an example, we\nconsider HD149026, a marginal post MS 1.3 Msun star.

The degree of time/frequency localization, the existence\nof a mapping between scale and frequency, and the bias involved in estimating\nproperties of modulated oscillatory signals, are proposed as important\nconsiderations. Wavelet behavior is found to be strongly impacted by the degree\nof asymmetry of the wavelet in both the frequency and the time domain, as\nquantified by the third central moments.

Its\nmorphology and orientation are in excellent agreement with the torus-like\npulsar nebula, seen almost edge on in X-rays although its extension is only\nabout a half of that in X-rays. In the optical we likely see only the brightest\ncentral part of the torus with the pulsar. The object is identical to the\ncounterpart of the torus recently detected in the mid-IR. The estimated pulsar\ncontribution to the optical flux is less than 10%. Combinig the optical/mid-IR\nfluxes and X-ray power-law spectrum extracted from the spatial region\nconstrained by the optical/IR source extent we compile a tentative\nmulti-wavelength spectrum of the central part of the nebula.
