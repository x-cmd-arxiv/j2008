The grading by charge and scaling\ndimension is anomalous if the first Chern class of the target space is nonzero.\nThis has some nontrivial consequences for the chiral algebra. As an example, we\nstudy the case where the target space is CP^1, and show that worldsheet\ninstantons trivialize the chiral algebra entirely. Consequently, supersymmetry\nis spontaneously broken in this model. We then turn to a closer look at the\nsupersymmetry breaking from the viewpoint of Morse theory on loop space. We\nfind that instantons interpolate between pairs of perturbative supersymmetric\nstates with different fermionic numbers, hence lifting them out of the\nsupersymmetric spectrum.

The ejected material's lower value of $R_V$ will lead to a lower\naverage value ($\\bar{R}_V$) for SNIa observed at higher redshift.\n  Two relations in SNIa observations indicate evolution of the average $R_V$:\nthe relation of observed $R_V$ with inclination of the host galaxy at low\nredshift and the matching of the distribution of extinction values ($A_V$) for\nSNIa in different redshift intervals. The inclination effect does point to a\nhalo with lower $R_V$ values. In contrast, the distributions of $A_V$ values\nmatch best for a $\\bar{R}_V(z)$ evolution that mimics the relation of SNIa\ndimming with redshift attributed to the cosmological constant. However, even in\nthe worse case scenario, the evolution $\\bar{R}_V$ can not fully explain the\ndimming of SNIa: host galaxy extinction law evolution is not a viable\nalternative to account for the dimming of SNIa.\n  Future observations of SNIa --multi-color lightcurves and spectra-- will\nsolve separately for values of $A_V$ and $R_V$ for each SNIa .

Using an analogy with standard fluid mechanics, we have\nrecently suggested a novel mechanism of segregation in granular mixtures based\non a {\\it competition between buoyancy and geometric forces}: the Archimedean\nbuoyancy force, a pseudo-thermal buoyancy force due to the difference between\nthe energies of two granular species, and two geometric forces, one compressive\nand the other-one tensile in nature, due to the size-difference. For a mixture\nof perfectly hard-particles with elastic collisions, the pseudo-thermal\nbuoyancy force is zero but the intruder has to overcome the net compressive\ngeometric force to rise. For this case, the geometric force competes with the\nstandard Archimedean buoyancy force to yield a threshold density-ratio,\n$R_{\\rho 1}=\\rho_l/\\rho_s < 1$, above which the {\\it lighter intruder sinks},\nthereby signalling the {\\it onset} of the {\\it reverse buoyancy} effect.

The main challenge for this kind\nof model is actually to find a way to introduce properly the more relevant\ndegree of freedom of the gluon: spin or helicity.

We use data from SOHO/MDI to reconstruct the\nmagnetic field in coronal holes and the quiet Sun with the help of a potential\nmagnetic model. Starting from a regular grid on the solar surface we then trace\nfield lines, which provide the overall geometry of the 3D magnetic field\nstructure.

High and long closed loops are\nextremely rare, whereas short and low-lying loops are almost as abundant in\ncoronal holes as in the quiet Sun. When interpreted in the light of loop\nscaling laws this result suggests an explanation for the relatively strong\nchromospheric and transition region emission (many low-lying, short loops), but\nthe weak coronal emission (few high and long loops) in coronal holes. In spite\nof this contrast our calculations also suggest that a significant fraction of\nthe cool emission in CHs comes from the open flux regions.

In this paper we investigate how compressed sensing (CS) can\nprovide new insights into astronomical data compression and more generally how\nit paves the way for new conceptions in astronomical remote sensing. We first\ngive a brief overview of the compressed sensing theory which provides very\nsimple coding process with low computational cost, thus favoring its use for\nreal-time applications often found on board space mission. We introduce a\npractical and effective recovery algorithm for decoding compressed data. In\nastronomy, physical prior information is often crucial for devising effective\nsignal processing methods.

In this\ncontext, compressed sensing is a new framework in which data acquisition and\ndata processing are merged.

Our approach is based on four commutators\nsimilar to the ones we previously proposed for Wannier excitons. They allow us\nto calculate any physical quantity dealing with $N$ excitons in terms of \"Pauli\nscatterings\" for carrier exchange in the absence of carrier interaction and\n\"interaction scatterings\" for carrier interaction in the absence of carrier\nexchange. We show that Frenkel excitons have a novel \"transfer assisted\nexchange scattering\", specific to these excitons. It comes from indirect\nCoulomb processes between localized atomic states. These indirect processes,\ncommonly called \"electron-hole exchange\" in the case of Wannier excitons and\nmost often neglected, are crucial for Frenkel excitons, as they are the only\nones responsible for the excitation transfer. We also show that in spite of the\nfact that Frenkel excitons are made of electrons and holes on the same atomic\nsite, so that we could naively see them as elementary particles, they\ndefinitely are composite objects, their composite nature appearing through\nvarious properties, not always easy to guess.

Quantum state of a three-level\n$\\Lambda$ configuration atomic system oscillates periodically between two\nground levels, when two pairs of classical detuning laser fields driving the\nsystem into the ODS under evolving adiabatic conditions. The decoherence of the\nODS evolution is greatly suppressed, and the oscillation is very stable,\ntherefore adiabatic population transfer and the preparation of an arbitrary\nquantum superposition state of atomic system can be completed accurately and\nconveniently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2008 03:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-04"}
