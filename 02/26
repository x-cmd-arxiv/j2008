This representation\nis obtained through a quantized representation of the Hecke operators. in this\nrepresentation, the Hecke operators act on the Berezin's quantization,\ndeformation algebra of the fundamental domain of $\\PSL(2,\\Z)$ in the upper\nhalfplane. The Hecke operators are inheriting from the ambient, non-commutative\nalgebra on which they act, a rich structure of matrix inequalities. Using this\nconstruction we obtain that, for every prime $p$, the essential spectrum of the\nclassical Hecke operator $T_p$ is contained in the interval $[-2\\sqrt p, 2\\sqrt\np]$, predicted by the Ramanujan Petersson conjectures. In particular, given an\nopen interval containing $[-2\\sqrt p, 2\\sqrt p]$, there are at most a finite\nnumber of possible exceptional eigenvalues lying outside this interval. The\nmain tool for obtaining this representation of the Hecke operators (unitarely\nequivalent to the classical representation, up to commuting phase) is a Schurr\ntype, positive \"square root\" of the state on $\\PGL(2,\\Q)$, measuring the\ndisplacement of fundamental domain by translations in $\\PGL(2,\\Q)$.

Asking that this be symplectic gives a\ncurvature inequality first considered by Reznikov. We study this inequality in\nthe case when the base has dimension four, with three main aims. Firstly, we\nuse this approach to construct symplectic six-manifolds with c_1=0 which are\nnever Kahler; e.g., we produce such manifolds with b_1=0=b_3 and also with\nc_2.omega <0, answering questions posed by Smith-Thomas-Yau. Examples come from\nRiemannian geometry, via the Levi-Civita connection on Lambda^+. The underlying\nsix-manifold is then the twistor space and often the symplectic structure tames\nthe Eells-Salamon twistor almost complex structure. Our second aim is to\nexploit this to deduce new results about minimal surfaces: if a certain\ncurvature inequality holds, it follows that the space of minimal surfaces (with\nfixed topological invariants) is compactifiable; the minimal surfaces must also\nsatisfy an adjunction inequality, unifying and generalising results of\nChen--Tian. One metric satisfying the curvature inequality is hyperbolic\nfour-space H^4. Our final aim is to show that the corresponding symplectic\nmanifold is symplectomorphic to the small resolution of the conifold xw-yz=0 in\nC^4. We explain how this fits into a hyperbolic description of the conifold\ntransition, with isometries of H^4 acting symplectomorphically on the\nresolution and isometries of H^3 acting biholomorphically on the smoothing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2008 16:26:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2008 15:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-24"}

We show that remote spins can be entangled\nin this case even when the intermediary coupling strengths are unequal. Second,\nwe propose an alternative adiabatic control procedure, and find that the system\nrequirements become even less restrictive in this case.

Compared with the solar abundances, most\nof the elements have solar composition with respect to hydrogen except C which\nis overabundant by 0.28 dex and Fe which is depleted by $\\sim 0.2$ dex.\nContrary to most previous work, we find that the star is not H-poor and has a\nnormal He composition. These abundances are compared with those found in the\ndiffuse X-ray plasma and the nebular gas. Compared to the plasma emitting in\ndiffuse X-rays, the stellar wind is much less depleted in iron. Since the iron\ndepletions in the nebular gas and X-ray plasma are similar, we conclude that\nthe plasma emitting diffuse X-rays is derived from the nebular gas rather than\nthe stellar wind. Excellent agreement is obtained between the abundances in the\nstellar wind and the nebular recombination line abundances for He, C, and O\nrelative to H. On the other hand, the derived stellar N abundance is smaller\nthan the nebular N abundance derived from recombination lines and agrees with\nthe abundance found from collisionally-excited lines. The mean temperature\nvariation determined by five different methods indicates that the difference in\nthe nebular abundances between the recombination lines and collisionally\nexcited lines can be explained as due to the temperature variations in a\nchemically homogeneous medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2008 20:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

An uncoupled CTRW with zero-mean\njumps is a martingale. It is proved that, as a consequence of the martingale\ntransform theorem, if the CTRW is a martingale, the Ito integral is a\nmartingale too. It is shown how the definition of the stochastic integrals can\nbe used to easily compute them by Monte Carlo simulation. The relations between\na CTRW, its quadratic variation, its Stratonovich integral and its Ito integral\nare highlighted by numerical calculations when the jumps in space of the CTRW\nhave a symmetric Levy alpha-stable distribution and its waiting times have a\none-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution. Remarkably these distributions have\nfat tails and an unbounded quadratic variation.

The interstellar dust stream in the\ninner solar system is altered by the solar radiation pressure force,\ngravitational focussing and interaction of charged grains with the time varying\ninterplanetary magnetic field. The grains act as tracers of the physical\nconditions in the local interstellar cloud (LIC). Our in-situ measurements\nimply the existence of a population of 'big' interstellar grains (up to 10e-13\nkg) and a gas-to-dust-mass ratio in the LIC which is a factor of > 2 larger\nthan the one derived from astronomical observations, indicating a concentration\nof interstellar dust in the very local interstellar medium. Until 2004, the\ninterstellar dust flow direction measured by Ulysses was close to the mean apex\nof the Sun's motion through the LIC, while in 2005, the data showed a 30 deg\nshift, the reason of which is presently unknown. We review the results from\nspacecraft-based in-situ interstellar dust measurements in the solar system and\ntheir implications for the physical and chemical state of the LIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2008 11:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We accomplish this using three-dimensional finite-frequency\ntravel-time sensitivity kernels for flows along with a 2+1 dimensional (2+1D)\noptimally localized averaging (OLA) inversion scheme. Travel times are measured\nby ridge filtering MDI full-disk Doppler data and the corresponding Born\nsensitivity kernels are computed for these particular travel times. We also\nutilize the full noise covariance properties of the travel times which allow us\nto accurately estimate the errors for all inversions. The whole procedure is\nthus fully consistent. Due to ridge filtering, the kernel functions separate in\nthe horizontal and vertical directions, motivating our choice of a 2+1D\ninversion implementation. The inversion procedure also minimizes cross-talk\neffects among the three flow components, and the averaging kernels resulting\nfrom the inversion show very small amounts of cross-talk. We obtain\nthree-dimensional maps of vector solar flows in the quiet Sun at spatial\nresolutions of 7-10 Mm using generally 24 h of data. For all of the flow maps\nwe provide averaging kernels and the noise estimates.

By taking into\naccount these inhomogeneities just through the Meissner fraction, the observed\ndiamagnetism may still be explained, consistently above and below the\nsuperconducting transition, in terms of the conventional Ginzburg-Landau\napproach with fluctuations of Cooper pairs and vortices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2008 15:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
