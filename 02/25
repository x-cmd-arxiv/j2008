To reach\ngeneral conclusions, we present the statistical behavior by analyzing data\nrecorded on a large number of individual quantum dots. Exciton charge is\ncontrolled with extremely high fidelity through an n-type field effect\nstructure, providing access to the neutral exciton (X0), the biexciton (2X0)\nand the positively (X1+) and negatively (X1-) charged excitons. We find\nsignificant differences in the recombination lifetime of each exciton such\nthat, on average, Tau(X1-) / Tau(X0) = 1.25, Tau(X1+) / Tau(X0) = 1.58 and\nTau(2X0) / Tau(X0) = 0.65. We attribute the change in lifetime to significant\nchanges in the single particle hole wave function on charging the dot, an\neffect more pronounced on charging X0 with a single hole than with a single\nelectron. We verify this interpretation by recasting the experimental data on\nexciton energies in terms of Coulomb energies.

It also provides a\nmechanism in stabilizing the volume moduli of extra dimensions. However, the\nshape moduli of the extra dimensions were never taken into account in the\nprevious work. We therefore study the stabilization mechanism for both volume\nand shape moduli due to the Casimir energy in ${\\mathbb M}^{1+3} \\times\n{\\mathbb T}^{2}$. The result of our study shows that the previously known local\nminimum is a saddle point. It is unstable to the perturbations in the direction\nof the shape moduli. The new stable local minima stabilizes all the moduli and\ndrives the accelerating expansion of the universe.

This work is an attempt to understand the fundamental\nperformance of WLANs under unsaturated condition. In particular, we are\ninterested in the delay performance when collisions of packets are resolved by\nan exponential backoff mechanism. Using a multiple-vacation queueing model, we\nderive an explicit expression for packet delay distribution, from which\nnecessary conditions for finite mean delay and delay jitter are established. It\nis found that under some circumstances, mean delay and delay jitter may\napproach infinity even when the traffic load is way below the saturation\nthroughput. Saturation throughput is therefore not a sound measure of WLAN\ncapacity when the underlying applications are delay sensitive. To bridge the\ngap, we define safe-bounded-mean-delay (SBMD) throughput and\nsafe-bounded-delay-jitter (SBDJ) throughput that reflect the actual network\ncapacity users can enjoy when they require bounded mean delay and delay jitter,\nrespectively. The analytical model in this paper is general enough to cover\nboth single-packet reception (SPR) and multi-packet reception (MPR) WLANs, as\nwell as carrier-sensing and non-carrier-sensing networks. We show that the SBMD\nand SBDJ throughputs scale super-linearly with the MPR capability of a network.\nTogether with our earlier work that proves super-linear throughput scaling\nunder saturation condition, our results here complete the demonstration of MPR\nas a powerful capacity-enhancement technique for both delay-sensitive and\ndelay-tolerant applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2008 08:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-26"}

We present here\ninferences based on mode parameters calculated from 2088-days long MDI, GONG\nand GOLF time series that were fitted to estimate very low frequency rotational\nsplittings (nu < 1.7 mHz). These low frequency modes provide data of\nexceptional quality, since the width of the mode peaks is much smaller than the\nrotational splitting and hence it is much easier to separate the rotational\nsplittings from the effects caused by the finite lifetime and the stochastic\nexcitation of the modes. We also have implemented a new inversion methodology\nthat allows us to infer the rotation rate of the radiative interior from mode\nsets that span l=1 to 25. Our results are compatible with the sun rotating like\na rigid solid in most of the radiative zone and slowing down in the core (R_sun\n< 0.2). A resolution analysis of the inversion was carried out for the solar\nrotation inverse problem. This analysis effectively establishes a direct\nrelationship between the mode set included in the inversion and the sensitivity\nand information content of the resulting inferences.

It is known that, for an interval of the clause-to-variables\nratio, this decomposes into an exponential number of pure states (clusters). We\nrefine substantially this picture by: (i) determining the precise location of\nthe clustering transition; (ii) uncovering a second `condensation' phase\ntransition in the structure of the solution set for k larger or equal than 4.\nThese results both follow from computing the large deviation rate of the\ninternal entropy of pure states. From a technical point of view our main\ncontributions are a simplified version of the cavity formalism for special\nvalues of the Parisi replica symmetry breaking parameter m (in particular for\nm=1 via a correspondence with the tree reconstruction problem) and new large-k\nexpansions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2008 14:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Feb 2008 10:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The quadric inequalities are tightly related to CHSH,\nthey are their iterated versions (equation 20). Consequently, it is proved that\nQ is contained in a hyperbolic cube whose axes lie along the non-local\n(Popescu, Rohrlich) boxes. As an application, a tight constraint on the rate of\nlocal boxes that must be present in every quantum correlation is derived.
