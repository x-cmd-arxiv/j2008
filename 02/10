This deviation, by\nitself, serves as a powerful tool to discriminate among theories for the origin\nof cosmological structures such as inflationary models. Here, we use a\nminimally-parametric smoothing spline technique to reconstruct the shape of the\nprimordial power spectrum. This technique is well-suited to search for smooth\nfeatures in the primordial power spectrum such as deviations from scale\ninvariance or a running spectral index, although it would recover sharp\nfeatures of high statistical significance. We use the WMAP 3 year results in\ncombination with data from a suite of higher resolution CMB experiments\n(including the latest ACBAR 2008 release), as well as large-scale structure\ndata from SDSS and 2dFGRS. We employ cross-validation to assess, using the data\nthemselves, the optimal amount of smoothness in the primordial power spectrum\nconsistent with the data. This minimally-parametric reconstruction supports the\nevidence for a power law primordial power spectrum with a red tilt, but not for\ndeviations from a power law power spectrum. Smooth variations in the primordial\npower spectrum are not significantly degenerate with the other cosmological\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2008 12:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Jul 2008 16:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

It has been shown\nthat the variability of this type can be produced by the inward diffusion of\nthe local driving perturbations in a bounded configuration (accretion disk or\ncorona). In the framework of this model, the perturbation diffusion time t_0 is\nrelated to the phenomenological break frequency, while the PDS power-law slope\nabove the ``break'' is determined by the viscosity distribution over the\nconfiguration. he perturbation diffusion scenario explains the decay of the\npower of X-ray variability observed in a number of compact sources (containing\nblack hole and neutron star) during an evolution of theses sources from\nlow/hard to high/soft states.

Most models in the literature assume that the inducer\nenters the cell via the carrier (permease), and exits by a diffusion-like\nprocess. The diffusive influx and carrier efflux are neglected. However,\nanalysis of the data shows that in non-induced cells, the diffusive influx is\ncomparable to the carrier influx, and in induced cells, the carrier efflux is 7\ntimes the diffusive efflux. Since bistability entails the coexistence of steady\nstates corresponding to both non-induced and induced cells, neither one of\nthese fluxes can be ignored.

The subtleties of this approach are illustrated\nusing a concrete example of observables connected with pi-eta scattering. This\nprocess seems to be a suitable theoretical laboratory for this purpose due to\nits sensitivity to the values of the O(p^4) LEC's, namely to the values of the\nfluctuation parameters L4 and L6. We discuss several issues in detail, namely\nthe choice of `good' observables and properties of their bare expansions, the\n`safe' reparametrization in terms of physical observables, the implementation\nof exact perturbative unitarity and exact renormalization scale independence,\nthe role of higher order remainders and their estimates. We make a detailed\ncomparison with standard chiral perturbation theory and use generalized ChPT as\nwell as resonance chiral theory to estimate the higher order remainders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2008 20:23:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 09:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-06"}

Under appropriate\nconditions on the measurement matrix, the entire information about the original\nsparse vector is captured in the measurements, and can be recovered using\nefficient polynomial methods. The vector model has been extended to a finite\nset of sparse vectors sharing a common non-zero location set. In this paper, we\ntreat a broader framework in which the goal is to recover a possibly infinite\nset of jointly sparse vectors. Extending existing recovery methods to this\nmodel is difficult due to the infinite structure of the sparse vector set.\nInstead, we prove that the entire infinite set of sparse vectors can recovered\nby solving a single, reduced-size finite-dimensional problem, corresponding to\nrecovery of a finite set of sparse vectors. We then show that the problem can\nbe further reduced to the basic recovery of a single sparse vector by randomly\ncombining the measurement vectors. Our approach results in exact recovery of\nboth countable and uncountable sets as it does not rely on discretization or\nheuristic techniques. To efficiently recover the single sparse vector produced\nby the last reduction step, we suggest an empirical boosting strategy that\nimproves the recovery ability of any given sub-optimal method for recovering a\nsparse vector. Numerical experiments on random data demonstrate that when\napplied to infinite sets our strategy outperforms discretization techniques in\nterms of both run time and empirical recovery rate. In the finite model, our\nboosting algorithm is characterized by fast run time and superior recovery rate\nthan known popular methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2008 07:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In particular, we examine the\nE(J-H) and E(H-K) color-excesses, and the effective extinction law observed in\ndiscrete GMC regions. We also study the effect of the relative scale height of\nthe GMC distribution to the color-excesses, and to the observed mass function\nof GMCs. We perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with 3D models\nof stellar radiation and clumpy dust distributions, resembling a face-on\ngeometry. The scattered light is included in the models, and near-infrared\ncolor maps are calculated from the simulated data. The effective near-infrared\nreddening law, i.e. the ratio E(J-H)/E(H-K), has a value close to unity in GMC\nregions. The ratio depends on the relative scale height of GMCs, xi, and for xi\nvalues 0.1...0.75 we find the typical ratios of 0.6...1.1. The effective\nextinction law turns out to be very flat in GMC regions. We find the ratios of\napparent extinctions of A(H)/A(K)=1.35...1.55 and A(J)/A(H)=1.15. The effect of\nthe scattered flux on the effective reddening law, as well as on the effective\nextinction law, is significant. Regarding the GMC mass function, we find no\ncorrelation between the input and observed slopes of the mass functions.\nRather, the observed slope reflects the parameter $\\xi$ and the dynamical range\nof the mass function.

Letting the number of iterations\ntend to infinity we get the density evolution threshold, the largest channel\nparameter so that the bit error probability tends to zero as a function of the\niterations.\n  In practice we often work with short codes and perform a large number of\niterations. It is therefore interesting to consider what happens if in the\nstandard analysis we exchange the order in which the blocklength and the number\nof iterations diverge to infinity. In particular, we can ask whether both\nlimits give the same threshold.\n  Although empirical observations strongly suggest that the exchange of limits\nis valid for all channel parameters, we limit our discussion to channel\nparameters below the density evolution threshold.
