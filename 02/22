We find that, in the case of thermal production, the limits\nfor the majoron mass read 0.12 keV<m_J<0.17 keV, and discuss how these limits\nare modified in the non-thermal case. The majoron lifetime is constrained to be\nlarger than 250 Gyrs. We also apply this results to a given seesaw model for\nthe generation of neutrino masses, and find that this constraints the energy\nscale for the lepton number breaking phase transition to be above 10^6 GeV. We\nthus find that the majoron decaying dark matter (DDM) scenario fits nicely in\nmodels where neutrino masses arise \"a la seesaw\" and may lead to other possible\ncosmological implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2008 16:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

We argue on general grounds\nthat the most likely models of modular slow-roll inflation are small field\nmodels in which the inflaton moves about a Planck distance from an extremum of\nthe potential. We then focus on models in which the inflaton is the bosonic\ncomponent of a single (complex) chiral superfield and explain the generic\ndifficulties in designing small field models of modular inflation. We then show\nthat if the Kaehler potential (KP) of the inflaton is logarithmic as in\nperturbative string theories, then it is not possible to satisfy the slow-roll\nconditions for any superpotential. We find that if the corrections to the KP\nare large enough so it can be approximated by a canonical KP in the vicinity of\nthe extremum, then viable slow-roll inflation is possible. In this case,\nseveral parameters have to be tuned to a fraction of a percent. We give a\nprescription for designing successful small field supergravity models of\ninflation when the KP is canonical and calculate the slow-roll parameters from\nthe superpotential parameters. Our results strengthen the case for models in\nwhich the moduli slowly roll about a Planck distance from a relatively high\nscale extremum that is located in the vicinity of the central region of moduli\nspace units. Generic models of this class predict a red spectrum of scalar\nperturbations and negligible spectral index running. They also predict a\ncharacteristic suppression of tensor perturbations despite the high scale of\ninflation. Consequently, a detection of primordial tensor anisotropies or\nspectral index running in cosmic microwave background observations in the\nforeseeable future will rule out this entire class of modular inflation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2008 16:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-15"}

Gas ionized by starburst activity radiates radio recombination lines\n(RRLs), from which one can derive the plasma conditions and the number of\nmassive stars formed in the burst, free of dust obscuration effects.\n  Aims. We aimed to find RRL emission from additional starburst systems and to\nuse the line properties to estimate the properties of the ionized gas.\n  Methods. We conducted a search for RRLs in the nearby extragalactic starburst\nor Seyfert galaxies NGC 1808, the Circinus galaxy, NGC 4038/9, II Zw 40, NGC\n6221, NGC 7552, IRAS 18325-5926, IC 5063, and VV 114. We used the VLA and the\nATCA to search for the RRLs H91alpha and H92alpha with rest frequencies of 8.6\nGHz and 8.3 GHz.\n  Results. We detected for the first time RRLs from the starburst nuclei in the\nCircinus galaxy and NGC 1808. The Circinus galaxy was detected with a line\nstrength integrated over the source of 3.2 mJy, making it the fourth-strongest\nextragalactic RRL emitter known at this frequency (after NGC 4945, M 82, and\nNGC 253). The line and continuum emission can be matched by a model consisting\nof a collection of 50 to 10 000 H II regions with 300 to 9000 O5 stars required\nto maintain the ionization, inferring a star formation rate of 0.2 Msun/yr to 6\nMsun/yr. NGC 1808 was detected in RRL emission at 3.9 sigma with a line\nstrength of 0.47 mJy at the expected velocity.\n  Conclusion. We have detected RRLs from two galaxies, adding to the small but\ngrowing number of known extragalactic RRL emitters. The Circinus galaxy is\nstrong and especially suited to high-quality follow-up spectroscopic study. We\nderived conditions and star formation rates in the starbursting regions.\nUncertainties can be reduced by future multi-transition studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2008 17:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We consider three kinds of\ndisorder: (a) inhomogeneous exciton energy, (b) inhomogeneous exciton-photon\ncoupling and (c) deviations from an ideal lattice. These three types of\ndisorder are characteristic of different physical systems, and their separate\nanalysis gives insight on the competition between randomness and light-matter\ncoupling. We consider conventional planar polariton structures (with excitons\nresonant to photon modes emitting normal to the cavity) and Bragg polariton\nstructures, in which excitons in a lattice are resonant with photon modes at a\nfinite angle satisfying the Bragg condition. We calculate the absorption\nspectra in the normal direction and at the Bragg angle by a direct\ndiagonalization of the exciton-photon Hamiltonian.

The maximum extent of a nucleus that can resist expansion is derived\nnumerically for a wide range of initial conditions; observed nuclei are shown\nto be compact enough to resist expansion, although there may have been an\nearlier generation of low-density nuclei that were dissolved. An evolutionary\nmodel for NGC 205 is presented which suggests that the nucleus of this galaxy\nhas already undergone core collapse. Adding a massive black hole to a nucleus\ninhibits core collapse, and nuclear star clusters with black holes always\nexpand, due primarily to heat input from the galaxy and secondarily to heating\nfrom stellar disruptions. The expansion rate is smaller for larger black holes\ndue to the smaller temperature difference between galaxy and nucleus when the\nblack hole is large.

This has bearing on the question of what\nkinds of topological information can be extracted in principle from unitary 2+1\ndimensional TQFTs.\n  The proof involves the construction of a suitable complexity function c on\nall closed 3-manifolds, satisfying a gluing axiom which we call the topological\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality, namely that c(AB) <= max(c(AA),c(BB)) for all A,B\nwhich bound S, with equality if and only if A=B.

LMF theory relies on\nsplitting the Coulomb potential into a short-ranged part that combines with\nother short-ranged core interactions and is simulated explicitly. The averaged\neffects of the remaining long-ranged part are taken into account through a\nself-consistently determined effective external field. The theory contains an\nadjustable length parameter sigma that specifies the cut-off distance for the\nshort-ranged interaction. This can be chosen to minimize the errors resulting\nfrom the mean-field treatment of the complementary long-ranged part. Here we\nsuggest that in many cases an accurate approximation to the effective field can\nbe obtained directly from the equilibrium charge density given by the Debye\ntheory of screening, thus eliminating the need for a self-consistent treatment.\nIn the limit sigma -> 0, this assumption reduces to the classical Debye\napproximation. We examine the numerical performance of this approximation for a\nsimple model of a symmetric ionic mixture. Our results for thermodynamic and\nstructural properties of uniform ionic mixtures agree well with similar results\nof Ewald simulations of the full ionic system. In addition we have used the\nsimplified theory in a grand-canonical simulation of a nonuniform ionic mixture\nwhere an ion has been fixed at the origin. Simulations using short-ranged\ntruncations of the Coulomb interactions alone do not satisfy the exact\ncondition of complete screening of the fixed ion, but this condition is\nrecovered when the effective field is taken into account. We argue that this\nsimplified approach can also be used in the simulations of more complex\nnonuniform systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2008 23:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This capacity gain can often be leveraged by\nutilizing channel state information at the transmitter and the receiver. Users\nmake use of this channel state information for transmit signal adaptation. In\nthis correspondence, we derive the capacity region for the MIMO multiple access\nchannel (MIMO MAC) when partial channel state information is available at the\ntransmitters, where we assume a synchronous MIMO multiuser uplink. The partial\nchannel state information feedback has a cardinality constraint and is fed back\nfrom the basestation to the users using a limited rate feedback channel. Using\nthis feedback information, we propose a finite codebook design method to\nmaximize sum-rate. In this correspondence, the codebook is a set of transmit\nsignal covariance matrices. We also derive the capacity region and codebook\ndesign methods in the case that the covariance matrix is rank-one (i.e.,\nbeamforming). This is motivated by the fact that beamforming is optimal in\ncertain conditions. The simulation results show that when the number of\nfeedback bits increases, the capacity also increases. Even with a small number\nof feedback bits, the performance of the proposed system is close to an optimal\nsolution with the full feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2008 04:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-25"}

Recent studies have shown that\nessentially two different outcomes are possible. Either the species surviving\ncompetition are more or less uniformly distributed over the resource spectrum,\nor their distribution is 'lumped' (or 'clumped'), consisting of clusters of\nspecies with similar resource use that are separated by gaps in resource space.\nWhich of these outcomes will occur crucially depends on the competition kernel,\nwhich reflects the shape of the resource utilization pattern of the competing\nspecies. Most models considered in the literature assume a Gaussian competition\nkernel. This is unfortunate, since predictions based on such a Gaussian\nassumption are not robust. In fact, Gaussian kernels are a border case\nscenario, and slight deviations from this function can lead to either uniform\nor lumped species distributions. Here we illustrate the non-robustness of the\nGaussian assumption by simulating different implementations of the standard\ncompetition model with constant carrying capacity. In this scenario, lumped\nspecies distributions can come about by secondary ecological or evolutionary\nmechanisms or by details of the numerical implementation of the model. We\nanalyze the origin of this sensitivity and discuss it in the context of recent\napplications of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2008 09:30:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 17:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 09:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}

Though certain information can be obtained for\narbitrary solutions, e.g., via geodesic deviation, in general, because of the\ncoordinate freedom, it is often hard or impossible to do. Most of the time\ninformation is found from special conditions, e.g., degenerate principle null\nvectors, weak fields close to Minkowski space (using coordinates close to\nMinkowski coordinates) or from solutions that have symmetries or approximate\nsymmetries. In the present work we will be concerned with asymptotically flat\nspace times where the approximate symmetry is the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS)\ngroup. For these spaces the Bondi four-momentum vector and its evolution, found\nfrom the Weyl tensor at infinity, describes the total energy-momentum of the\ninterior source and the energy-momentum radiated. By generalizing the\nstructures (shear-free null geodesic congruences) associated with the\nalgebraically special metrics to asymptotically shear-free null geodesic\ncongruences, which are available in all asymptotically flat space-times, we\ngive kinematic meaning to the Bondi four-momentum. In other words we describe\nthe Bondi vector and its evolution in terms of a center of mass position\nvector, its velocity and a spin-vector, all having clear geometric meaning.\nAmong other items, from dynamic arguments, we define a unique (at our level of\napproximation) total angular momentum and extract its evolution equation in the\nform of a conservation law with an angular momentum flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2008 13:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The goal of this study is\nto estimate the importance of the chemistry occuring on grain surfaces for the\ndeuteration of H2. Furthermore, we aim to find a robust and general surface\nchemical model which can be used in different astrophysical environments.\nMethods: Surface processes are described for the cases of graphitic and\namorphous--carbon grains, where laboratory work is available.\nLangmuir--Hinshelwood as well as Eley--Rideal surface chemistries are included\nin the model and their relative contributions are highlighted. Analytic\nexpressions are derived for H2, HD, and D2 formation efficiencies for both type\nof grains. Rate equations are tested against stochastic methods. Results: As\nexpected, rate equations and stochastic methods diverge for grain sizes lower\nthan a critical value acrit. For grain sizes below this critical value, D2\nformation decreases to favour HD formation. The formation efficiencies of H2\nand D2 can be calculated by adding a correction factor to the rate equations\nmethods. We found that because of the presence of chemisorbed sites, which can\nstore atoms to form molecules up to high grain temperatures, the formation\nefficiency of HD and D2 is very high compared to models where only\nphysisorption sites are taken into account. When considering a realistic\ndistribution of dust grains, we found that the formation rate of H2 and HD is\nenhanced by an order of magnitude if small grains are taken into account.

Boulders in\nturn increase their radii by sweeping up the dust fragments. An analytical\nsolution to the dynamical equations predicts that growth by\ncoagulation-fragmentation can be efficient and allow agglomeration of\n10-meter-sized objects within the time-scale of the radial drift. These results\nare supported by computer simulations of the motion of boulders and fragments\nin 3-D time-dependent magnetorotational turbulence. Allowing however the\nfragments to diffuse freely out of the sedimentary layer of boulders reduces\nthe density of both boulders and fragments in the mid-plane, and thus also the\ngrowth of the boulder radius, drastically. The reason is that the turbulent\ndiffusion time-scale is so much shorter than the collisional time-scale that\ndust fragments leak out of the mid-plane layer before they can be swept up by\nthe boulders there. Our conclusion that coagulation-fragmentation is not an\nefficient way to grow across the meter barrier in fully turbulent\nprotoplanetary discs confirms recent results by Brauer, Dullemond, & Henning\nwho solved the coagulation equation in a parameterised turbulence model with\ncollisional fragmentation, cratering, radial drift, and a range of particle\nsizes. We find that a relatively small population of boulders in a sedimentary\nmid-plane layer can populate the entire vertical extent of the disc with small\ngrains and that these grains are not first generation dust, but have been\nthrough several agglomeration-destruction cycles during the simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2008 15:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2008 09:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A new\nconcept for designing such an achromatic phase shifter is presented here. The\nmajor interest of this solution is that it allows a simple design, with\nessentially one device per beam. The heart of the system consists in two\ncellular mirrors where each cell has a thickness introducing for the central\nwavelength, a phase shift of (2k+1)pi or of 2k pi on the fraction of the wave\nit reflects. Each mirror is put in one of the collimated beams of the\ninterferometer.

Recently, it has been shown that a standard field\nparametrization of these reduced models admits no Fock quantization with a\nunitary dynamics. This lack of unitarity is surpassed by a convenient\nredefinition of the field and the choice of an adequate complex structure. The\nresult is a Fock quantization where both the dynamics and the SO(3)-symmetries\nof the field equations are unitarily implemented. The present work proves that\nthis Fock representation is in fact unique inasmuch as, up to equivalence,\nthere exists no other possible choice of SO(3)-invariant complex structure\nleading to a unitary implementation of the time evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2008 15:23:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2008 11:46:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
