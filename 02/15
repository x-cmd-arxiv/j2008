Numerical models are\ndeveloped in order to establish the dependence of driving parameters such as\nuseful spectral range, angular size of the observed star, or detector noise on\nthe total WFE measurement error. The latter is found particularly sensitive to\nphoton noise, which rapidly governs the achieved accuracy for telescope\ndiameters higher than 10 m. We study a few practical examples, showing that TI\nmethod is applicable to AO systems on telescope diameters ranging from 10 to 50\nm, depending on seeing conditions and magnitude of the observed stars. We also\ndiscuss the case of a space-borne coronagraph where TI technique provides high\nsampling of the input WFE map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2008 16:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-17"}

Circular polarisation signatures in photospheric lines and in narrow\nemission lines tracing magnetospheric accretion are monitored throughout most\nof the rotation cycle of BP Tau at two different epochs in 2006. We observe\nthat rotational modulation dominates the temporal variations of both\nunpolarised and circularly polarised spectral proxies tracing the photosphere\nand the footpoints of accretion funnels.\n  From the complete data sets at each epoch, we reconstruct the large-scale\nmagnetic topology and the location of accretion spots at the surface of BP Tau\nusing tomographic imaging. We find that the field of BP Tau involves a 1.2 kG\ndipole and 1.6 kG octupole, both slightly tilted with respect to the rotation\naxis. Accretion spots coincide with the two main magnetic poles at high\nlatitudes and overlap with dark photospheric spots; they cover about 2% of the\nstellar surface. The strong mainly-axisymmetric poloidal field of BP Tau is\nvery reminiscent of magnetic topologies of fully-convective dwarfs. It suggests\nthat magnetic fields of fully-convective cTTSs such as BP Tau are likely not\nfossil remants, but rather result from vigorous dynamo action operating within\nthe bulk of their convective zones.\n  Preliminary modelling suggests that the magnetosphere of BP Tau extends to\ndistances of at least 4 R* to ensure that accretion spots are located at high\nlatitudes, and is not blown open close to the surface by a putative stellar\nwind. It apparently succeeds in coupling to the accretion disc as far out as\nthe corotation radius, and could possibly explain the slow rotation of BP Tau.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2008 16:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the last case the substantial anisotropy of\nthe expansion of order $1/\\sqrt{N}$ survives until the end of inflation. The\nlightest vector fields might also force the late time acceleration of the\nUniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2008 17:59:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2008 13:02:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2008 13:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-20"}

We make use of a new statistical\nestimator to obtain precise measurements of the LRG auto-correlations and\nconstrain halo occupation distributions for them.

Canonical understanding of the radio gaps invokes either blocking of\nthe back-flowing lobe plasma by the denser interstellar medium (ISM) of the\nhost galaxy, or \"squeezing\" of the radio bridge in the middle through buoyancy\nforce exerted by either the ISM or the surrounding intra-cluster medium (ICM).\nThese pictures encounter difficulties in explaining situations where the\nsharp-edged radio gaps associated with non-cluster radio galaxies have widths\nrunning into several tens (even hundreds) of kiloparsecs. More particularly,\nthe required dense high-pressure ISM/ICM is likely to be lacking at least in\nthe case of high-redshift radio galaxies. We propose here that radio emission\ngaps in at least such cases could arise from a dynamical interaction between\nthe powerful thermal wind outflowing from the active galactic nucleus and the\nback-flowing synchrotron plasma in the two radio lobes, which occurs once the\nrapidly advancing jets have crossed out of the wind zone into the intergalactic\nmedium. A simple analytical scheme is presented to explore the plausibility of\nthe side-ways confinement of the thermal wind by the radio lobe pair, which\nwould \"freeze\" pancake shaped conduits in the space, along which the hot, metal\nenriched wind from the AGN can escape (roughly orthogonal to the radio axis).\nSome other possible consequences of this scenario are pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2008 23:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

However, nowadays we are witnessing a\nslowdown in performance progress, which may be considered as a sign that the\nsaturation-based technology is reaching its inherent limits.

Despite\nthe lack of an AFM quantum critical point in the P-T phase diagram, we\nhighlight the fact that the unconventional SC occurs in both phases of the AFM\nand PM. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 in the AFM phase have\nprovided evidence for the uniformly coexisting AFM+SC phase. In the HF-PM phase\nwhere AFM fluctuations are not developed, 1/T1 decreases without the coherence\npeak just below Tc, followed by a power-law like T dependence that indicates an\nunconventional SC with a line-node gap. Remarkably, Tc has a peak around Pc in\nthe HF-PM phase as well as in the AFM phase. In other words, an SC dome exists\nwith a maximum value of Tc = 230 mK around Pc, indicating that the origin of\nthe pressure-induced HF SC in CeIn3 is not relevant to AFM spin fluctuations\nbut to the emergence of the first-order QPT in CeIn3. When the AFM critical\ntemperature is suppressed at the termination point of the first-order QPT, Pc =\n2.46 GPa, the diverging AFM spin-density fluctuations emerge at the critical\npoint from the AFM to PM.

The\nstudies aim at testing recent predictions of a strong amplification of short\nwavelength magnetic field and at studying the evolution of the magnetic\nturbulence and its backreaction on cosmic rays. We observe that an oblique\nfilamentary mode grows more rapidly than the non-resonant parallel modes found\nin analytical theory, and the growth rate of the field perturbations is much\nslower than is estimated for the parallel plane-wave mode, possibly because in\nour simulations we cannot maintain omega << Omega_i, the ion gyrofrequency, to\nthe degree required for the plane-wave mode to emerge. The evolved oblique\nfilamentary mode was also observed in MHD simulations to dominate in the\nnonlinear phase. We thus confirm the generation of the turbulent magnetic field\ndue to the drift of cosmic-ray ions in the upstream plasma, but as our main\nresult find that the amplitude of the turbulence saturates at about dB/B~1. The\nbackreaction of the turbulence on the particles leads to an alignment of the\nbulk-flow velocities of the cosmic rays and the background medium, which is an\nessential characteristic of cosmic-ray modified shocks. It accounts for the\nsaturation of the instability at moderate field amplitudes.

The advantage of the harmonic\ninteractions is that the integration of the equations of motion in the\nstreaming step can be performed analytically. Therefore, the algorithm is\ncomputationally as efficient as the original MPC algorithm for Newtonian\nfluids. The collision step is the same as in the original MPC method. All\nparticles are confined between two solid walls moving oppositely, so that both\nsteady and oscillatory shear flows can be investigated. Attractive wall\npotentials are applied to obtain a nearly uniform density everywhere in the\nsimulation box. We find that both in steady and oscillatory shear flow, a\nboundary layer develops near the wall, with a higher velocity gradient than in\nthe bulk. The thickness of this layer is proportional to the average dumbbell\nsize. We determine the zero-shear viscosities as a function of the spring\nconstant of the dumbbells and the mean free path. For very high shear rates, a\nvery weak ``shear thickening'' behavior is observed. Moreover, storage and loss\nmoduli are calculated in oscillatory shear, which show that the viscoelastic\nproperties at low and moderate frequencies are consistent with a Maxwell fluid\nbehavior.

This energy exchange from\nthe disc to the corona which depends on the disc physical properties is\nmodified because of the magnetic interaction between the stellar magnetic field\nand the accretion disc. According to our fully analytical solutions for such a\nsystem, the existence of a corona not only increases the surface density but\nreduces the temperature of the accretion disc. Also, the presence of a corona\nenhances the ratio of gas pressure to the total pressure.

We have taken a recently-published surface magnetogram of\none moderately-accreting T Tauri star (V2129 Oph) and used it to extrapolate\nthe geometry of its large-scale field. We determine the structure of the open\n(wind-bearing) field lines, the closed (X-ray bright) field lines and those\npotentially accreting field lines that pass through the equatorial plane inside\nthe Keplerian co-rotation radius. We consider a series of models in which the\nstellar magnetic field is opened up by the outward pressure of the hot coronal\ngas at a range of radii. As this radius is increased, accretion takes place\nalong simpler field structures and impacts on fewer sites at the stellar\nsurface. This is consistent with the observed variation in the Ca II IRT and\nHeI lines which suggests that accretion in the visible hemisphere is confined\nto a single high-latitude spot. By determining the density and velocity of the\naccretion flows, we find that in order to have most of the total mass accretion\nrate impacting on a single high-latitude region we need disk material to\naccrete from approximately 7R*, close to the Keplerian co-rotation radius at\n6.8R*. We also calculate the coronal density and X-ray emission measure. We\nfind that both the magnitude and rotational modulation of the emission measure\nincrease as the source surface is increased. For the field structure of V2129\nOph which is dominantly octupolar, the emission forms a bright, high-latitude\nring that is always in view as the star rotates. Since the accretion funnels\nare not dense enough to cause significant scattering of coronal X-ray photons,\nthey provide only a low rotational modulation of around 10% at most.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2008 14:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Since these particles\nare degenerate, they collide very little, and therefore make it possible for\nthe star to support strong, organized magnetic fields over long times.

Variants of\nthese games - defined by the type of moves allowed for the players - have been\nfound to be closely connected to graph decompositions and associated width\nmeasures such as path- or tree-width. Of particular interest is the question\nwhether these games are monotone, i.e. whether the cops can catch a robber\nwithout ever allowing the robber to reach positions that have been cleared\nbefore. The monotonicity problem for graph searching games has intensely been\nstudied in the literature, but for two types of games the problem was left\nunresolved. These are the games on digraphs where the robber is invisible and\nlazy or visible and fast. In this paper, we solve the problems by giving\nexamples showing that both types of games are non-monotone. Graph searching\ngames on digraphs are closely related to recent proposals for digraph\ndecompositions generalising tree-width to directed graphs. These proposals have\npartly been motivated by attempts to develop a structure theory for digraphs\nsimilar to the graph minor theory developed by Robertson and Seymour for\nundirected graphs, and partly by the immense number of algorithmic results\nusing tree-width of undirected graphs and the hope that part of this success\nmight be reproducible on digraphs using a directed tree-width. Unfortunately\nthe number of applications for the digraphs measures introduced so far is still\nsmall. We therefore explore the limits of the algorithmic applicability of\ndigraph decompositions. In particular, we show that various natural candidates\nfor problems that might benefit from digraphs having small directed tree-width\nremain NP-complete even on almost acyclic graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2008 15:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-18"}

The method is particularly useful for generally\ncovariant systems and systems with a degenerate canonical symplectic form, such\nas Einstein Cartan gravity, to which we apply the method explicitly.
