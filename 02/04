Radiative heating/cooling is parameterized with a simplified\nNewtonian relaxation scheme. Our simulations develop day-night temperature\ncontrasts that vary strongly with pressure. At low pressure (<10 mbar), air\nflows from the substellar point toward the antistellar point, both along the\nequator and over the poles. At deeper levels, the flow develops an eastward\nequatorial jet with speeds of 3-4 km/sec, with weaker westward flows at high\nlatitudes. This basic flow pattern is robust to variations in model resolution,\ngravity, radiative time constant, and initial temperature structure. Nightside\nspectra show deep absorption bands of H2O, CO, and/or CH4, whereas on the\ndayside these absorption bands flatten out or even flip into emission. This\nresults from the strong effect of dynamics on the vertical temperature-pressure\nstructure; the temperature decreases strongly with altitude on the nightside\nbut becomes almost isothermal on the dayside. In Spitzer bandpasses, our\npredicted planet-to-star flux ratios vary by a factor of 2-10 with orbital\nphase, depending on the wavelength and chemistry.

The actual size of\nthese fermion pairs varies by orders of magnitude from the femtometer scale in\nneutron stars and nuclei to the micrometer range in conventional\nsuperconductors. Many properties of the superfluid depend on the pair size\nrelative to the interparticle spacing. This is expressed in BCS-BEC crossover\ntheories, describing the crossover from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) type\nsuperfluid of loosely bound and large Cooper pairs to Bose-Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) of tightly bound molecules. Such a crossover superfluid has\nbeen realized in ultracold atomic gases where high temperature superfluidity\nhas been observed. The microscopic properties of the fermion pairs can be\nprobed with radio-frequency (rf) spectroscopy. Previous work was difficult to\ninterpret due to strong and not well understood final state interactions. Here\nwe realize a new superfluid spin mixture where such interactions have\nnegligible influence and present fermion-pair dissociation spectra that reveal\nthe underlying pairing correlations. This allows us to determine the\nspectroscopic pair size in the resonantly interacting gas to be 2.6(2)/kF (kF\nis the Fermi wave number). The pairs are therefore smaller than the\ninterparticle spacing and the smallest pairs observed in fermionic superfluids.\nThis finding highlights the importance of small fermion pairs for superfluidity\nat high critical temperatures.

In the present article we demonstrate using\natomistic simulations that at ultra-low temperature transient inter-layer\natomic transport is also possible without tunneling when the Pt/Al(111)\nimpurity/host system self-organizes itself spontaneously into an intermixed\nconfiguration. No such extremely fast athermal concerted process has been\nreported before at ultra low temperatures. The outlined novel transient atomic\nexchange mechanism could be of general validity. We find that the source of\nultra-low temperature heavy particle barrier crossing is intrinsic and no\nexternal bias is necessary for atomic intermixing and surface alloying in Pt/Al\nalthough the dynamic barrier height is few eV. The mechanism is driven by the\nlocal thermalization of the Al(111) surface in a self-organized manner arranged\nspontaneously by the system without any external stimulus. The core of the\nshort lived thermalized region reaches the local temperature of $\\sim 1000$ K\n(including few tens of Al atoms) while the average temperature of the\nsimulation cell is $\\sim 3$ K. The transient facilitated intermixing process\nalso takes place with repulsive impurity-host interaction potential leading to\nnegative atomic mobility hence the atomic injection is largely independent of\nthe strength of the impurity-surface interaction.

Because of the thermoelectric effect, there is no net\ncharge current but there is a heat flow from the hot side to the cold side. We\nperform the theoretical calculation of dynamical thermospin Hall conductivity\nin a two-dimensional Rashba spintronic system. It has been shown that the\ndirect interband optical transition dominates the ordering and manipulation of\nspin in the generation of a transverse intrinsic spin current. In view of the\nrole of the thermoelectric effect, the contributions to the thermospin Hall\neffect are classified as that originating from a direct contribution of thermal\nelectronic diffusion and that from the compensatory electron flow in balance\nwith the thermal diffusion. For a finite system, the analysis yields evidence\nthat the spin accumulation around the edges of a plate determines the\nmagnetization. In equilibrium, a field created by a magnetization gradient\nemerges in the direction perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The\nexperimental observation of the thermospin Hall effect is proposed by measuring\nthe longitudinal temperature difference with the injection of a transverse spin\ncurrent and by analyzing the Hall angle. In addition, in order to achieve pure\nspin accumulation in the spin Hall effect, an extension of the thermospin Hall\neffect for exciting electron-hole pairs in semiconductors is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2008 08:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-05"}

This occurs when the Minkowski\naction contains $t$-odd CP-violating terms. Analytic continuation to Euclidean\ntime yields an imaginary term in the Euclidean action. In the presence of\nimaginary terms in the Euclidean action, the usual method of perturbative\nquantization can fail. Here the action is expanded about its critical points,\nthe quadratic part serving to define the Gaussian free theory and the higher\norder terms defining the perturbative interactions. For a complex action, the\ncritical points are generically obtained at complex field configurations. Hence\nthe contour of path integration does not pass through the critical points and\nthe perturbative paradigm cannot be directly implemented. The contour of path\nintegration has to be deformed to pass through the complex critical point using\na generalized method of steepest descent, in order to do so. Typically, what is\ndone is that only the real part of the Euclidean action is considered, and its\ncritical points are used to define the perturbation theory. In this article we\npresent a simple 0+1-dimensional example, of $N$ scalar fields interacting with\na U(1) gauge field, in the presence of a Chern-Simons term, where\nalternatively, the path integral can be done exactly, the procedure of\ndeformation of the contour of path integration can be done explicitly and the\nstandard method of only taking into account the real part of the action can be\nfollowed.

AIMS: For such studies, one needs to have an excellent knowledge of the\nclose environment of the lensed images in order to model the lensing potential:\nthis means observational data over a large field-of-view and spectroscopy at\nhigh spatial resolution.

Using the low, medium and high resolution modes, we study the quasar\nimages and the quasar environments, as well as provide a detailed report of the\ndata reduction. RESULTS: Comparison between the quasar spectra of the different\nimages reveals differences for HE 0230-2130, RX J0911.4+0551 and H 1413+117:\nflux ratios between the images of the same quasar are different when measured\nin the emission lines and in the continuum.

Because of the strong gravitational pull of the\nblack hole, matter is removed from the companion star and falls into the\ncompact ob ject. In falling, it forms an accretion disk of gas that spirals\ntowards the center, heating up and emitting in X rays. The physics of such a\nstructure is extremely complex and can be studied through observations with\nX-ray satellites. The time series derived from X-ray observations of bright\nblack-hole binaries in the Galaxy show a complex phenomenology. Broad noise\ncomponents with a variability of up to 40% are observed, as well as\nquasi-periodic features on time scales from 100 seconds down to a few\nmilliseconds. The characteristic frequencies of the different components can\nchange on very short time scales. However, some of these signals are elusive as\nthey are very weak and are drowned in intrinsic and instrumental noise. The\nphysical nature of these signals is still largely unknown, but it is clear that\nthey originate from gas orbiting a few kilometers from the central black hole\nand accreting onto it. In addition of being important for the study of the\naccretion of matter onto a black hole, these observational properties\nconstitute a unique probe for testing General Relativity in the strong field\nregime.

If these distributions have\nfractal geometry, it must be reflected in the geometry of voids; in particular,\nwe expect scaling sizes of voids. However, this scaling is not well\ndemonstrated in galaxy surveys yet. AIMS: Our objective is to understand the\ngeometry of cosmic voids in relation to a fractal structure of matter. We\nintend to distinguish monofractal voids from multifractal voids, regarding\ntheir scaling properties. We plan to analyse voids in the distributions of mass\nconcentrations (halos) in a multifractal and their relation to galaxy voids.\nMETHODS: We make a statistical analysis of point distributions based on the\nvoid probability function and correlation functions. We assume that voids are\nspherical and devise a simple spherical void finder. For continuous mass\ndistributions, we employ the methods of fractal geometry. We confirm the\nanalytical predictions with numerical simulations. Smoothed mass distributions\nare suitable for the method of excursion sets. RESULTS: Voids are very\nnonlinear and non-perturbative structures. Voids reflect the fractal geometry\nof the matter distribution but not always directly: scaling sizes of voids\nimply fractal geometry, but fractal voids may have a complicated geometry and\nmay not have scaling sizes. Proper multifractal voids are of this type. A\nnatural multifractal biasing model implies that the voids in the galaxy\ndistribution inherit the same complicated geometry. CONCLUSIONS: Current galaxy\nsurveys as well as cosmological N-body simulations indicate that cosmic voids\nare proper multifractal voids. This implies the presence in the voids of\ngalaxies or, at least, small dark matter halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2008 11:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-05"}

As a result, the use of any infrared cutoff\nbelow the scale of eternal inflation is permitted, provided that the background\nfields are appropriately redefined. The natural choice for the infrared cutoff\nwould of course be the present horizon; other choices manifest themselves in\nthe running of the correlators. We also demonstrate that it is possible to\ndefine observables that are renormalization group invariant.

In this case, it is necessary to resort to\nthe \"blind separation\" methods. One important member of this class is\nrepresented by the \"Independent Components Analysis\" (ICA).

One of the most serious is the difficulty to take into account any\ninformation available in advance. In particular, ICA is not able to exploit the\nfact that emission of CMB is the same at all the frequencies of observations.\nHere, we show how to deal with this question.

Inspired by the observation of\nself-organized oscillations of pedestrian flows at bottlenecks [D. Helbing and\nP. Moln\\'ar, Phys. Eev.

Specifically,\nour approach assumes a priority-based control of traffic lights by the vehicle\nflows themselves, taking into account short-sighted anticipation of vehicle\nflows and platoons. The considered local interactions lead to emergent\ncoordination patterns such as ``green waves'' and achieve an efficient,\ndecentralized traffic light control. While the proposed self-control adapts\nflexibly to local flow conditions and often leads to non-cyclical switching\npatterns with changing service sequences of different traffic flows, an almost\nperiodic service may evolve under certain conditions and suggests the existence\nof a spontaneous synchronization of traffic lights despite the varying delays\ndue to variable vehicle queues and travel times. The self-organized traffic\nlight control is based on an optimization and a stabilization rule, each of\nwhich performs poorly at high utilizations of the road network, while their\nproper combination reaches a superior performance. The result is a considerable\nreduction not only in the average travel times, but also of their variation.\nSimilar control approaches could be applied to the coordination of logistic and\nproduction processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2008 13:23:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2008 07:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
