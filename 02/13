Here we calculate the damping of the primary mode by the parametric\ninstability, i.e., by nonlinear, 3-mode coupling between the low-order primary\nmode and pairs of high-order g-modes. We show that the primary mode is strongly\ncoupled to highly resonant, neutrino damped pairs with n>10; such short\nwavelength interactions cannot be resolved in the simulations. We find that the\nparametric instability saturates the primary mode energy at ~10^{48} ergs, well\nbelow the energy needed to drive an explosion.

The position of the 850\n$\\mu$m passband on the Rayleigh-Jeans portion of the Planck function leads to a\nmaximum redshift estimate of $z\\sim$4.5 since sources will not retain their\nredshift independent brightness close to the peak of the Planck function and\nthus drop out of surveys.

We consider the\nimplication of this absorption for ice induced spectral structure at far\ninfrared wavelengths and present marginal astronomical evidence that amorphous\nice may have a feature similar to crystalline ice near 150 $\\mu$m. Recent\ncorroborative laboratory evidence is supportive of this conclusion. It is\nargued that early metal enrichment by pair instability SN may lead to a high\nice content relative to refractory dust at high redshift and a fairly robust\ndetection of ice emission in a $z=6.42$ quasar is presented.

We find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux from\nthe planet in this bandpass is 76 +/- 3% of the maximum flux; this corresponds\nto minimum and maximum hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 +/-\n48 K and 1220 +/- 47 K, respectively. The planet reaches its maximum flux at an\norbital phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20-30\ndegrees east of the substellar point. Because tidally locked hot Jupiters would\nhave enormous day-night temperature differences in the absence of winds, the\nsmall amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet's\natmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the night\nside at the 24 micron photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperature\ndifferences. The similarities between the 8 and 24 micron phase curves for HD\n189733b lead us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in a\nfundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by these two\nwavelengths. One-dimensional radiative transfer models indicate that the 8\nmicron band should probe pressures 2-3 times greater than at 24 micron,\nalthough the uncertain methane abundance complicates the interpretation. If\nthese two bandpasses do probe different pressures, it would indicate that the\ntemperature varies only weakly between the two sensed depths, and hence that\nthe atmosphere is not convective at these altitudes.

Typically an input to these problems is\na family of sets over a finite universe and the goal is to cover the elements\nof the universe with as few sets of the family as possible.\n  The variations of covering problems include well known problems like Set\nCover, Vertex Cover, Dominating Set and Facility Location to name a few.\nRecently there has been a lot of study on partial covering problems, a natural\ngeneralization of covering problems. Here, the goal is not to cover all the\nelements but to cover the specified number of elements with the minimum number\nof sets.\n  In this paper we study partial covering problems in graphs in the realm of\nparameterized complexity. Classical (non-partial) version of all these problems\nhave been intensively studied in planar graphs and in graphs excluding a fixed\ngraph $H$ as a minor. However, the techniques developed for parameterized\nversion of non-partial covering problems cannot be applied directly to their\npartial counterparts. The approach we use, to show that various partial\ncovering problems are fixed parameter tractable on planar graphs, graphs of\nbounded local treewidth and graph excluding some graph as a minor, is quite\ndifferent from previously known techniques.

Our\nGMOS data cover a 5.5' field of view and reach a limiting magnitude i' = 26,\nabout 0.5 magnitude fainter than the turnover point of the GC luminosity\nfunction. We find that NGC 3311 has a huge population of ~16, 000 GCs, closely\nsimilar to the prototypical high specific frequency Virgo giant M87. The\ncolor-magnitude distribution shows that the metal-poor blue GC sequence and the\nmetal-richer red sequence are both present, with nearly equal numbers of\nclusters. Bimodal fits to the color distributions confirm that the blue\nsequence shows the same trend of progressively increasing metallicity with GC\nmass that has previously been found in many other large galaxies; the\ncorrelation we find corresponds to a scaling of GC metallicity with mass of Z ~\nM^0.6 . By contrast, the red sequence shows no change of mean metallicity with\nmass, but it shows an upward extension to much higher than normal luminosity\ninto the UCD-like range, strengthening the potential connections between\nmassive GCs and UCDs. The GC luminosity function, which we measure down to the\nturnover point at M_I = -8.4, also has a normal form like those in other giant\nellipticals. Within the Hydra field, another giant elliptical NGC 3309 is\nsitting just 100\" from the cD NGC 3311. We use our data to solve simultaneously\nfor the spatial structure and total GC populations of both galaxies at once.\nTheir specific frequencies are S_N (NGC 3311) = 12.5 +/- 1.5 and S_N (NGC 3309)\n= 0.6 +/-0.4. NGC 3311 is completely dominant and entirely comparable with\nother cD-type systems such as M87 in Virgo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2008 21:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These are commonly\ncalled WNL stars (e.g., WN7h), but this new shorthand avoids confusion because\nthere are late-type WN stars without H and early-type WN stars with H. Clearly\ndifferentiating WNH stars from H-free WN stars is critical when discussing\nprogenitors of Type Ib/c SNe and GRBs -- the massive WNH stars are not likely\nSN progenitors, and are distinct from core-He burning WR stars. We show that\nthe masses of WNH stars are systematically higher than H-poor WR stars (both WN\nand WC), with little overlap, while H mass fractions of luminous WNH stars\nexceed those of LBVs. We favor the interpretation that the most luminous WNH\nstars are still core-H burning, pre-LBVs. While on the main sequence, a star's\nmass is reduced due to winds while its luminosity slowly rises, so the star\nincreases its Eddington factor and mass-loss rate, pushing it even closer to\nthe Eddington limit. With this feedback, observed masses and mass-loss rates of\nWNH stars are a natural outcome near the end of core-H burning. Feedback from\nthe strong WNH wind itself then enables the instability seen later as an LBV.\nSteadily climbing mass-loss rates also explain continuity in spectral traits\nfrom O3 V to O3 If* to WNH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2008 00:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Two hypotheses to explain\nits high luminosity -- that it was powered by shock interaction with CSM as\nimplied by its Type IIn spectrum, or that it was fueled by radioactive decay\nfrom a large mass of 56Ni synthesized in a pair-instability SN -- predicted\ndifferent late-time properties. Here we present observations of SN2006gy\nobtained more than a year after discovery. We were unable to detect it at\nvisual wavelengths, but clear near-IR K and H-band detections show that it is\nstill at least as luminous as the peak of a normal SN II. We also present\nspectra giving an upper limit to the late-time Ha luminosity of about 1e39\nerg/s. Based on the weak late-time Ha, X-ray, and radio emission, combined with\nthe difficulty of explaining the shift to IR wavelengths, we can rule out\nongoing CSM interaction as the primary late-time power source. Instead, we\npropose that the evolution of SN2006gy is consistent with one of two possible\nscenarios: (1) A pair-instability SN plus modest CSM interaction, where the\nradioactive decay luminosity shifts to the IR because of dust formation. (2) An\nIR echo, where radiation emitted during peak luminosity heats a pre-existing\ndust shell at radii near 1 light year, requiring the progenitor star to have\nejected another 10 Msun shell about 1500 yr before the SN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2008 00:25:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2008 21:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2008 22:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

To test this prediction we have\nobserved the open SMC cluster NGC 371 for 12 nights in order to search for beta\nCep and SPB stars.

In particular, we compare results for\nthe quark-meson coupling (QMC) model with those for the Glendenning--Moszkowski\nparametrization of the non-linear Walecka model (NLWM).

Our results do not favor\neither of the results of BES and CLEO collaborations, and further experimental\ntests are urged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2008 15:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2008 14:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 17:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The classic scaling prediction for the\ntransport diffusion coefficient on temperature and mass of diffusing\nspecies,D_He ~ sqrt(T), is confirmed over a T range from 40 K to 300 K for He\nand for the ratio of D_He/D_Ar ~ sqrt(m_Ar/m_He). Deviations of the channels\nfrom a cylindrical form, resolved with transmission electron microscopy down to\nsubnanometer scales, quantitatively account for a reduced diffusivity as\ncompared to Knudsen diffusion in ideal tubular channels. The membrane\npermeation experiments are described over 10 orders of magnitude in Kn,\nencompassing the transition flow regime, by the unified flow model of Beskok\nand Karniadakis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2008 15:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
