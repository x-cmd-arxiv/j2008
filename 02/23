Although the common hard state picture is that the accretion disk\nis truncated, perhaps at hundreds of gravitational radii from the black hole,\nrecent results for the recurrent transient GX 339-4 by Miller and co-workers\nshow evidence for optically thick material very close to the black hole's\ninnermost stable circular orbit. That work focused on an observation of GX\n339-4 at a luminosity of about 5% of the Eddington limit and used parameters\nfrom a relativistic reflection model and the presence of a soft, thermal\ncomponent as diagnostics. In this work, we use similar diagnostics, but extend\nthe study to lower luminosities (2.3% and 0.8% Ledd) using Swift and RXTE\nobservations of GX 339-4. We detect a thermal component with an inner disk\ntemperature of ~0.2 keV at 2.3% Ledd. We detect broad features due to iron\nKalpha that are likely related to reflection of hard X-rays off the optically\nthick material. If these features are broadened by relativistic effects, they\nindicate that optically thick material resides within 10 Rg down to 0.8% Ledd,\nand the measurements are consistent with the inner radius of the disk remaining\nat ~4 Rg down to this level. However, we also discuss an alternative model for\nthe broadening, and we note that the evolution of the thermal component is not\nentirely consistent with the constant inner radius interpretation. Finally, we\ndiscuss the results in terms of recent theoretical work on the possibility that\nmaterial may condense to maintain an inner optically thick disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2008 17:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nmodels for all dSph galaxies and for the Milky Way are able to reproduce\nseveral observational features of these galaxies, such as a series of abundance\nratios and the stellar metallicities distributions. The Milky Way model adopts\nthe two-infall scenario, whereas the most important features of the models for\nthe dSph galaxies are the low star-formation rate and the occurrence of intense\ngalactic winds. We predict that the [s-r/Fe] ratios in dSphs are generally\ndifferent than the corresponding ratios in the Milky Way, at the same [Fe/H]\nvalues. This is interpreted as a consequence of the time-delay model coupled\nwith different star formation histories. In particular, the star-formation is\nless efficient in dSphs than in our Galaxy and it is influenced by strong\ngalactic winds. Our predictions are in very good agreement with the available\nobservational data. The time-delay model for the galactic chemical enrichment\ncoupled with different histories of star formation in different galaxies allow\nus to succesfully interpret the observed differences in the abundance ratios of\ns- and r- process elements, as well as of $\\alpha$-elements in dSphs and in the\nMilky Way. These differences strongly suggest that the main stellar populations\nof these galaxies could not have had a common origin and, consequently, that\nthe progenitors of local dSphs might not be the same objects as the building\nblocks of our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2008 19:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the CMR regime, a strong competition between the\nferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic charge-ordered insulating states\nis observed. This competition is shown to be important to understand the\nresistivity peak that appears near the critical temperature.

The\nmost popular explanation for this \"infant mortality\" of young clusters is the\nexpulsion of natal gas by stellar winds and supernovae, which leaves up to 90%\nof them unbound. A cluster disruption model has recently been proposed in which\nthis mass- independent disruption of clusters proceeds for another Gyr after\ngas expulsion. In this scenario, the survival chances of massive clusters are\nmuch smaller than in the traditional mass-dependent disruption models. The most\ncommon way to study cluster disruption is to use the cluster age distribution,\nwhich, however, can be heavily affected by incompleteness. To avoid this, we\nintroduce a new method, based on size-of-sample effects, namely the relation\nbetween the most massive cluster, M_max, and the age range sampled. Assuming\nthat clusters are sampled from a power-law initial mass function, with index -2\nand that the cluster formation rate is constant, M_max scales with the age\nrange sampled, such that the slope in a log(M_max) vs. log(age) plot is equal\nto unity. This slope decreases if mass-independent disruption is included. For\n90% mass-independent cluster disruption per age dex, the predicted slope is\nzero. For the solar neighbourhood, SMC, LMC, M33, and M83, based on ages and\nmasses taken from the literature, we find slopes consistent with the expected\nsize-of-sample correlations for the first 100 Myr, hence ruling out the 90%\nmass-independent cluster disruption scenario. For M51, however, the increase of\nlog(M_max) with log(age) is slightly shallower and for the Antennae galaxies it\nis flat. This simple method shows that the formation and/or disruption of\nclusters in the Antennae must have been very different from that of the other\ngalaxies studied here, so it should not be taken as a representative case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2008 21:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It\nsignificantly extends a previous technique for the verification of secrecy. The\nprotocol is represented in an extension of the pi calculus with fairly\narbitrary cryptographic primitives. This protocol representation includes the\nspecification of the correspondence to be verified, but no other annotation.\nThis representation is then translated into an abstract representation by Horn\nclauses, which is used to prove the desired correspondence.

We find that many of the FFL properties are\nenhanced within this setup. We then proceed to identify all such FFLs in the D.\nMelanogaster regulatory network. We observe that in FFLs rooted at the same\ntranscription factor there are significant correlations between the number of\npredicted binding sites for the transcription factor and for the microRNA.\n  Conclusions: Based on a modeling approach we suggest that these correlations\nmay be an outcome of the type of FFL preferred by the transcription factor.\nThis may help elucidate the type of regulation the TF confers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2008 15:13:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2008 19:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-26"}
