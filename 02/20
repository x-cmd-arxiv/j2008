The standard polar-cap model for radio pulsars is\nmodified significantly when the polar magnetic field exceeds 1.8x10^{14} G.\nPairs are created by accelerated particles via resonant scattering of thermal\nX-rays, followed by the nearly instantaneous conversion of the scattered photon\nto a pair. A surface gap is then efficiently screened by e+- creation, which\nregulates the voltage in the inner part of the circuit to ~10^9 V. We also\nexamine the electrostatic gap structure that can form when the magnetic field\nis somewhat weaker, and deduce a voltage 10-30 times larger over a range of\nsurface temperatures. We examine carefully how the flow of charge back to the\nstar above the gap depends on the magnitude of the current that is extracted\nfrom the surface of the star, on the curvature of the magnetic field lines, and\non resonant drag. The rates of different channels of pair creation are\ndetermined self-consistently, including the non-resonant scattering of X-rays,\nand collisions between gamma rays and X-rays.

In order to protect the dust grains from destruction by the\nhot gas as well as by the energetic radiation of the accretion disk, the dust\nis often assumed to be distributed in clouds. In our new 3D model of AGN dust\ntori, the torus is modelled as a wedge-shaped disk in which dusty clouds are\nrandomly distributed, by taking the dust density distribution of the\ncorresponding continuous model into account. We especially concentrate on the\ndifferences between clumpy and continuous models in terms of the temperature\ndistributions, the surface brightness distributions and interferometric\nvisibilities, as well as spectral energy distributions. To this end, we employ\nradiative transfer calculations with the help of the 3D Monte Carlo code MC3D.\nIn a second step, interferometric visibilities are calculated from the\nsimulated surface brightness distributions, which can be directly compared to\nobservations with the MIDI instrument. The radial temperature distributions of\nclumpy models possess significantly enhanced scatter compared to the continuous\ncases. Even at large distances, clouds can be heated directly by the central\naccretion disk. The existence of the silicate 10 micron-feature in absorption\nor in emission depends sensitively on the distribution, the size and optical\ndepth of clouds in the innermost part of the torus, due to shadowing effects of\nclouds there. This explains failure and success of previous modelling efforts\nof clumpy tori. After adapting the parameters of our clumpy standard model to\nthe circumstances of the Seyfert 2 Circinus galaxy, it can qualitatively\nexplain recent mid-infrared interferometric observations performed with MIDI,\nas well as high resolution spectral data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2008 20:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The radial distribution of these stars has been found to be bimodal\n(similarly to that of several other clusters) with a prominent dip at ~60'' (~2\nr_c) from the cluster center.

The Kormendy relation of our BCGs is steeper than that of the\nlocal ellipticals, suggesting differences in the assembly history of these\ntypes of systems. We also find that while most BCGs show monotonic colour\ngradients consistent with a decrease in metallicity with radius, 25% of the\nBCGs show colour profiles that turn bluer towards the centre (blue-cores). We\ninterpret this bluing trend as evidence for recent star formation. The excess\nblue light leads to a typical offset from the red sequence of 0.5 to 1.0 mag in\n(g'-r'), thus affecting optical cluster studies that may reject the BCG based\non colour. All of the blue-core BCGs are located within ~10 kpc of the peak in\nthe cluster X-ray emission. Furthermore, virtually all of the BCGs with recent\nstar formation are in clusters that lie above the Lx-Tx relation. Based on\nphotometry alone, these findings suggest that central star formation is a\nubiquitous feature of BCGs in dynamically relaxed cool-core clusters.

However, ground-based images lack the\nrequired resolution to determine the morphologies of the merging galaxies, and\nto measure the amount of dust and associated gas. We present HST/ACS and WFPC2\nobservations of a sample of 31 bulge-dominated red-sequence galaxies at z~0.1,\ncomprised of ongoing mergers, merger remnants, and undisturbed galaxies. Nearly\nall galaxies have early-type morphologies and most are well-fit by r^1/4 law\nsurface brightness profiles. We find that only 10% of the galaxies show\nevidence for the presence of dust.

We infer that red mergers in the nearby Universe\nmostly involve early-type galaxies containing little cold gas and dust. This\nmay imply that the progenitors were mostly devoid of gas and/or that feedback\nmechanisms are very effective in preventing the gas to cool.

The light curves\nare folded on a range of periods centered on the planetary orbital period and\nphase dependent variability is quantified by Fourier methods and by the mean\nabsolute deviation (MAD) of the folded data for both the photometry and the Ca\nII K line reversals. The region varies in brightness on the time scale of a\nrotation by ~1 mmag. In 2004 it resembled a dark spot of variable depth, while\nin 2005 it varied between bright and dark. Over the 123 planetary orbits\nspanned by the photometry the variable region detected in 2004 and in 2005 are\nsynchronised to the planetary orbital period within 0.0015 d. The Ca II K line\nin 2001, 2002 and 2003 also shows enhanced K-line variability centered on\nphi=0.8, extending coverage to some 440 planetary revolutions. The apparently\nconstant rotation period of the variable region and its rapid variation make an\nexplanation in terms of conventional star spots unlikely. The lack of\ncomplementary variability at phi=0.3 and the detection of the variable region\nso far in advance of the sub-planetary point excludes tidal excitation, but the\ncombined photometric and Ca II K line reversal results make a good case for an\nactive region induced magnetically on the surface of tau Boo A by its planetary\ncompanion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2008 01:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Moreover, border bases have proved to be an excellent tool\nfor describing zero-dimensional ideals when the coefficients are inexact. And\nin this situation they show a clear advantage with respect to Groebner bases\nwhich, nevertheless, can also be used in the study of Hilbert schemes, since\nthey provide tools for constructing suitable stratifications.\n  In this paper we compare Groebner basis schemes with border basis schemes. It\nis shown that Groebner basis schemes and their associated universal families\ncan be viewed as weighted projective schemes. A first consequence of our\napproach is the proof that all the ideals which define a Groebner basis scheme\nand are obtained using Buchberger's Algorithm, are equal. Another result is\nthat if the origin (i.e. the point corresponding to the unique monomial ideal)\nin the Groebner basis scheme is smooth, then the scheme itself is isomorphic to\nan affine space. This fact represents a remarkable difference between border\nbasis and Groebner basis schemes. Since it is natural to look for situations\nwhere a Groebner basis scheme and the corresponding border basis scheme are\nequal, we address the issue, provide an answer, and exhibit some consequences.\nOpen problems are discussed at the end of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2008 11:17:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 16:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-26"}

We review here some of the ideas of how large scale magnetic\nfields in the universe, particularly in galaxies and galaxy clusters could\narise. The popular paradigm involves the generation of a seed magnetic field\nfollowed by turbulent dynamo amplification of the seed field. We first outline\nvarious seed field generation mechanisms including Biermann batteries. These in\ngeneral give a field much smaller than the observed field and so they require\nfurther amplification by dynamo action. The basic idea behind fluctuation\ndynamos, as applied to cluster magnetism and the mean-field helical dynamo as\napplied to disk galaxies, are outlined. Major difficulties with the dynamo\nparadigm are considered. It is particularly important to understand the\nnonlinear saturation of dynamos, and whether the fields produced are coherent\nenough on large-scales to explain the observed fields in galaxies and clusters.\nAt the same time the alternative possibility of a primordial field lacks firm\ntheoretical support but can have very interesting observational consequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2008 12:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}
