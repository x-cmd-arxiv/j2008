We divide Perseus into six sub-regions. The\nstandard X factor, X=N(H2)/W(12CO), is derived both for the whole Perseus\nComplex and for each of the six sub-regions with values consistent with\nprevious estimates. The X factor is heavily affected by the saturation of the\nemission above AV~4 mag, and variations are found between regions. We derive\nlinear fits to relate W(12CO) and AV using only points below 4 mag of\nextinction, this yields a better estimation of the AV than the X-factor. We\nderive linear relations of W(13CO), N(13CO) and W(C18O) with AV . The\nextinction threshold above which 13CO(1-0) and C18O(1-0) are detected is about\n1 mag larger than previous estimates. 12CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) lines saturate\nabove 4 and 5 mag, respectively, whereas C18O(1-0) never saturates (up to 10\nmag). Approximately 60% of the positions with 12CO emission have sub-thermally\nexcited lines, and almost all positions have 12CO excitation temperatures below\nthe dust temperature. Using the Meudon PDR code we find that 12CO and 13CO\nemission can be explained by uniform slab models with densities ranging between\nabout 10^3 and 10^4 cm-3. Local variations in the volume density and\nnon-thermal motions (linked to different star formation activity) can explain\nthe observations. Higher densities are needed to reproduce CO data toward\nactive star forming sites, where the larger internal motions driven by the\nyoung protostars allow more photons from the embedded high density cores to\nescape the cloud. In the most quiescent region, the 12CO and 13CO emission\nappears to arise from an almost uniform thin layer of molecular material at\ndensities around 10^4 cm-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2008 19:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-15"}

Non-perturbative renormalization of the relevant quark currents is\nperformed where necessary. The inverse lattice spacing, $a^{-1}$, is about 1.7\nGeV.

For a general locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous diffusion\ntensor in the wave vector space, the turbulence spectrum in the inertial range\ncan be fitted with power-laws with the power-law index varying with the wave\npropagation direction. For several locally isotropic but inhomogeneous\ndiffusion coefficients, the steady-state turbulence spectra are nearly\nisotropic in the absence of damping and can be fitted by a single power-law\nfunction. However, the energy flux is strongly polarized due to the\ninhomogeneity that leads to an anisotropic cascade. Including the anisotropic\nthermal damping, the turbulence spectrum cuts off at the wave numbers, where\nthe damping rates become comparable to the cascade rates. The combined\nanisotropic effects of cascade and damping make this cutoff wave number\ndependent on the wave propagation direction, and the propagation direction\nintegrated turbulence spectrum resembles a broken power-law, which cuts off at\nthe maximum of the cutoff wave numbers or the $^4$He cyclotron frequency.\nTaking into account the Doppler effects, the model can naturally reproduce the\nbroken power-law wave spectra observed in the solar wind and predicts that a\nhigher break frequency is aways accompanied with a greater spectral index\nchange that may be caused by the increase of the Alfv\\'{e}n Mach number, the\nreciprocal of the plasma beta, and/or the angle between the solar wind velocity\nand the mean magnetic field.

Despite being above\nthe critical metallicity, a metallicity range is found to exist around\n10^{-5}-10^{-4}Z_sun where low-mass fragmentation is prohibited. In this range,\nthree-body H_2 formation starts at low (~100K) temperature and thus the\nresulting heating causes a dramatic temperature jump, which makes the central\npart of the star-forming core transiently hydrostatic and thus highly\nspherical. With little elongation, the core does not experience fragmentation\nin the subsequent dust-cooling phase. The minimum fragmentation mass is set by\nthe Jeans mass just before the H_2 formation heating, and its value can be as\nhigh as ~10M_sun. For metallicity higher than ~10^{-4}Z_sun, H_2 formation is\nalmost completed by the dust-surface reaction before the onset of the\nthree-body reaction, and low-mass star formation becomes possible. This\nmechanism might explain the higher characteristic mass of metal-poor stars than\nin the solar neighborhood presumed from the statistics of carbon-enhanced\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2008 10:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A high-resolution\nsimulation with high-nth is necessary to reproduce the complex structure of the\ngas disk. The global properties of the model galaxies in low-nth models, such\nas star formation histories, are similar to those in the high-nth models when\nwe tune the value of C* so that they reproduce the observed relation between\nsurface gas density and surface star formation rate density.

The\nEnskog equation neglects velocity correlations but retains spatial correlations\narising from volume exclusion effects. As expected, there is a breakdown of the\nEinstein relation $\\epsilon=D/(T_0\\mu)\\neq 1$ relating diffusion $D$ and\nmobility $\\mu$, $T_0$ being the temperature of the impurity. The kinetic theory\nresults also show that the violation of the Einstein relation is only due to\nthe strong non-Maxwellian behavior of the reference state of the impurity\nparticles. The deviation of $\\epsilon$ from unity becomes more significant as\nthe solid volume fraction and the inelasticity increase, especially when the\nsystem is driven by the action of a Gaussian thermostat. This conclusion\nqualitatively agrees with some recent simulations of dense gases [Puglisi {\\em\net al.}, 2007 {\\em J. Stat.

However,\nsome of these stars have apparent lifetimes shorter the required flight time\nfrom the Galactic disk/center. We suggest that such stars have evolved in close\nrunaway or hypervelocity binaries. Stellar evolution of such binaries can drive\nthem into mass transfer configurations and even mergers. Such evolution could\nthen rejuvenate them (e.g. blue stragglers) and extend their lifetime after\ntheir ejection. The extended lifetimes of such stars could then be reconciled\nwith their flight times to the Galactic halo. We study the possibilities of\nbinary runaway and hypervelocity stars and show that such binaries could have\nbeen ejected in triple disruptions and other dynamical interactions with stars\nor with massive black holes. We show that currently observed \"too young\" star\nin the halo could have been ejected from the Galactic disk or the Galactic\ncenter and be observable in their current position if they were ejected as\nbinaries. Specifically it is shown that the hypervelocity star HE 0437-5439\ncould be such a rejuvenated star. Other suggestions for its ejection from the\nLMC are found to be highly unlikely. Moreover, it is shown that its observed\nmetallicity is most consistent with a Galactic origin and a Galactic center\norigin can not currently rule out. In addition, we suggest that triple\ndisruptions by the massive black hole in the Galactic center could also capture\nbinaries in close orbits near the MBH, some of which may later evolve to become\nmore massive rejuvenated stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2008 15:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2008 08:39:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2009 16:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We propose a model which takes into account the\ninfluence of paramagnetic impurities on the transport properties of the system\nto describe these features. It is assumed that the non-colinearity between the\ncore spins inside the nanoparticles and the paramagnetic impurities can be\nmodelled by an effective tunnel barrier, the height of which depends on the\nrelative angle between the magnetization of both kind of spins. The influence\non the magnetotransport properties of the height and the thickness of the\neffective tunnel barrier of the magnetic moment of the impurity, as well as the\nbias voltage are studied.

We present a new Ks-band survey that represents a significant extension\nto the previous wide-field Ks-band imaging survey within the 0226-04 field of\nthe VIMOS-VLT deep survey (VVDS).
