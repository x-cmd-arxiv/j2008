Since molecules\nhave the potential to reveal the exoplanet atmospheric conditions and\nchemistry, searching for them is a high priority. The rotational-vibrational\ntransition bands of water, carbon monoxide, and methane are anticipated to be\nthe primary sources of non-continuum opacity in hot-Jovian planets. Since these\nbands overlap in wavelength, and the corresponding signatures from them are\nweak, decisive identification requires precision infrared spectroscopy. Here we\nreport on a near-infrared transmission spectrum of the planet HD 189733b\nshowing the presence of methane. Additionally, a resolved water-vapour band at\n1.9 microns confirms the recent claim of water in this object. On\nthermochemical grounds, carbon-monoxide is expected to be abundant in the upper\natmosphere of hot-Jovian exoplanets; thus the detection of methane rather than\ncarbon-monoxide in such a hot planet could signal the presence of a horizontal\nchemical gradient away from the permanent dayside, or it may imply an\nill-understood photochemical mechanisms that leads to an enhancement of\nmethane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2008 18:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-08"}

The images reveal that at least\n17 of the 33 objects are associated with interactions. Up to one fifth of the\nsources in our sample could be minor mergers whereas only 2 systems are merging\nbinaries with luminosity ratio <=3:1, which is characteristic of local ULIRGs.\nThe rest-frame optical luminosities of the sources are of the order 10^10-10^11\nL_sun and their effective radii range from 1.4 to 4.9 kpc. The most compact\nsources are either those with a strong active nucleus continuum or those with a\nheavy obscuration in the mid-infrared regime, as determined from Spitzer\nInfra-Red Spectrograph data. The luminosity of the 7.7 micron feature produced\nby polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules varies significantly among compact\nsystems whereas it is typically large for extended systems. A bulge-to-disk\ndecomposition performed for the 6 brightest (m_H<20) sources in our sample\nindicates that they are best fit by disk-like profiles with small or negligible\nbulges, unlike the bulge-dominated remnants of local ULIRGs. Our results\nprovide evidence that the interactions associated with ultraluminous infrared\nactivity at z~2 can differ from those at z~0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2008 19:40:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 May 2008 16:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The algorithm\nexploits that bubble lengths may be limited, but without a prior assumption of\na maximal bubble length. No approximations, such as windowing, have been\nintroduced to reduce the time complexity. More than just finding the bubbles,\nthe algorithm produces a stitch profile, which is a probabilistic graphical\nmodel of bubbles and helical regions. The algorithm applies a probability peak\nfinding method based on a hierarchical analysis of the energy barriers in the\nPoland-Scheraga model.\n  Conclusions: Exact and fast computation of genomic stitch profiles is thus\nfeasible.

The luminosity\nintercent is 30%, or 2\\sigma, lower than determined from the X-ray flux-limited\nsample of Reiprich & Bohringer (2002), assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. This\ndifference could arise from a combination of Malmquist bias and/or systematic\nerror in hydrostatic mass estimates, both of which are expected. The intercept\nagrees with that derived by Stanek et al. (2006) using a model for the\nstatistical correspondence between clusters and halos in a WMAP3 cosmology with\npower spectrum normalization sigma_8 = 0.85. Similar exercises applied to\nfuture data sets will allow constraints on the covariance among optical and hot\ngas properties of clusters at fixed mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2008 21:21:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2008 17:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Regarding the 3.3, 6.3 and 11.2 micron bands similar conclusions\nhold as with small PAHs.\n  This does not hold for the other features. The larger PAH cations and anions\nproduce bands at 7.8 micron and, as PAH sizes increases, a band near 8.5 micron\nbecomes prominent and shifts slightly to the red. In addition, the average\nanion peak falls slightly to the red of the average cation peak. The similarity\nin behavior of the 7.8 and 8.6 micron bands with the astronomical observations\nsuggests that they arise from large, cationic and anionic PAHs, with the\nspecific peak position and profile reflecting the PAH cation to anion\nconcentration ratio and relative intensities of PAH size. Hence, the broad\nastronomical 7.7 micron band is produced by a mixture of small and large PAH\ncations and anions, with small and large PAHs contributing more to the 7.6 and\n7.8 micron component respectively.\n  For the CH out-of-plane vibrations, the duo hydrogens couple with the solo\nvibrations and produce bands that fall at wavelengths slightly different than\ntheir counterparts in smaller PAHs. As a consequence, previously deduced PAH\nstructures are altered in favor of more compact and symmetric forms.

This level of\ngravity could come from the real r^{-1} cusps of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos,\nbut the predicted gravity would have a large scatter due to dependence on\ncosmological parameters and formation histories. Better agreement is found with\nthe gravity from the scalar field in some co-variant versions of MOND, which\ncan create the mirage of a Newtonian effective dark halo of density Pi r^{-1}\nnear the center, where the characteristic surface density Pi=130alpha^{-1} Msun\npc^{-2} and alpha is a fundamental constant of order unity fixed by the\nLagrangian of the co-variant theory if neglecting environmental effects.\n  We show with a toy analytical model and a hydrodynamical simulation that a\nconstant background gravity due to MOND/TeVeS scalar field implies a critical\npressure synchronizing starbursts and the formation of galaxy bulges and\nellipticals. A universal threshold for the formation of the brightest regions\nof galaxies in a MONDian universe suggests that the central BHs, bulges and\nellipticals would respect tight correlations like the M_{bulge}-M_{BH}-sigma\nrelations.

Polar molecules have bright prospects for novel\nquantum gases with long-range and anisotropic interactions, for quantum\ninformation science, and for precision measurements. However, high-density\nclouds of ultracold polar molecules have so far not been produced. Here, we\nreport a key step towards this goal. Starting from an ultracold dense gas of\nheteronuclear 40K-87Rb Feshbach molecules with typical binding energies of a\nfew hundred kHz and a negligible dipole moment, we coherently transfer these\nmolecules into a vibrational level of the ground-state molecular potential\nbound by >10 GHz. We thereby increase the binding energy and the expected\ndipole moment of the 40K-87Rb molecules by more than four orders of magnitude\nin a single transfer step. Starting with a single initial state prepared with\nFeshbach association, we achieve a transfer efficiency of 84%. While dipolar\neffects are not yet observable, the presented technique can be extended to\naccess much more deeply bound vibrational levels and ultimately those\nexhibiting a significant dipole moment. The preparation of an ultracold quantum\ngas of polar molecules might therefore come within experimental reach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2008 05:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-01"}

The efficiency of these\nprocesses is determined by the disk structure. Theoretical models suggest that\nplanets form in protostellar disk regions with an inactive neutral ``dead\nzone'' near the mid plane, sandwiched together by partially ionized surface\nlayers where magnetorotational instability is active. Due to a transition in\nthe abundance of dust grains, the active layer's thickness decreases abruptly\nnear the ice line. Over a range of modest accretion rates ($\\sim\n10^{-9}-10^{-8} M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), the change in the angular momentum\ntransfer rate leads to local surface density and pressure distribution maxima\nnear the ice line. The azimuthal velocity becomes super-Keplerian and the\ngrains accumulate in this transition zone. This barrier locally retains\nprotoplanetary cores and enhances the heavy element surface density to the\ncritical value needed to initiate efficient gas accretion. It leads to a\npreferred location and epoch of gas giant formation. We simulate and reproduce\nthe observed frequency and mass-period distribution of gas giants around solar\ntype stars without having to greatly reduce the type I migration strength. The\nmass function of the short-period planets can be utilized to calibrate the\nefficiency of type I migration and to extrapolate the fraction of stars with\nhabitable terrestrial planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2008 09:45:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Jun 2008 09:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is well known that\ndata processing of microarcsecond-level astrometric observations imposes very\nstringent requirements on the accuracy of the orbital velocity of the satellite\n(a velocity correction of 1.45 mm/s implies an aberrational correction of 1\n$\\mu$as). Because of a number of degeneracies the orbital velocity cannot be\nfully restored from observations provided by the satellite. Seven constraints\nthat must be applied on a velocity parameterization are discussed and\nformulated mathematically. It is shown what part of velocity can be recovered\nfrom astrometric data by a combined fit of both velocity parameters and\nastrometric parameters of the sources. Numerical simulations show that, with\nthe seven constraints applied, the velocity and astrometric parameters can be\nreliably estimated from observational data. It is also argued that the idea to\nimprove the velocity of an astrometric satellite from its own observational\ndata is only useful if the a priori information on the orbital velocity\njustifies the applicability of the velocity constraints. The proposed model\ntakes into account only translational motion of the satellite and ignores any\nsatellite-specific parameters. Therefore, the results of this study are equally\napplicable to both scanning missions similar to Gaia, and pointing ones like\nSIM, provided that enough sources were observed sufficiently uniformly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2008 09:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-11"}

We find that, during jet\nlaunching, the jet head generates a strong shock in the wind. During and after\nthis process, strong recollimation shocks can occur due to the initial\noverpressure of the jet with its environment. The conditions in all these\nshocks are convenient to accelerate particles up to $\\sim$ TeV energies, which\ncan lead to leptonic (synchrotron and inverse Compton) and hadronic\n(proton-proton) radiation. In principle, the cylindrical jet simulations show\nthat the jet is stable, and can escape from the system even for relatively low\npower. However, when accounting for the wind ram pressure, the jet can be bent\nand disrupted for power $\\la 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2008 12:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our analysis shows that the Fe is significantly more extended than the\nstellar mass in the CDG in all of the clusters in our sample, with a slight\ntrend of increasing extent with increasing central cooling time. The excess Fe\nwithin the central 100 kpc in these clusters can be produced by Type Ia\nsupernovae from the CDG over the past 3-7 Gyr. Since the excess Fe primarily\noriginates from the CDG, it is a useful probe for determining the motion of the\ngas and the mechanical energy deposited by AGN outbursts over the past $\\sim$ 5\nGyr in the centers of clusters. We explore two possible mechanisms for\nproducing the greater extent of the Fe relative to the stars in the CDG,\nincluding: bulk expansion of the gas and turbulent diffusion of Fe. Assuming\nthe gas and Fe expand together, we find that a total energy of $10^{60} -\n10^{61}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ must have been deposited into the central 100 kpc of\nthese clusters to produce the presently observed Fe distributions. Since the\nrequired enrichment time for the excess Fe is approximately 5 Gyr in these\nclusters, this gives an average AGN mechanical power over this time of $10^{43}\n- 10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. The extended Fe distribution in cluster cores can also\narise from turbulent diffusion. Assuming steady-state (i.e., the outward mass\nflux of Fe across a given surface is equal to the mass injection rate of Fe\nwithin that surface) we find that diffusion coefficients of $10^{29} - 10^{30}$\ncm$^2$~s$^{-1}$ are required to maintain the presently observed Fe profiles\n(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2008 15:24:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2008 14:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
