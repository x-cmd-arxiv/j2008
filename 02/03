As main\napplication we consider the case of varieties which are quotients of a\nquasi-affine variety by the action of a diagonalizable group and thus admit a\nhomogeneous coordinate ring, such as toric varieties. Comparing these\ndecompositions with primary decompositions of graded modules over the\nhomogeneous coordinate ring, we show that these are equivalent if the action of\nthe diagonalizable group is free.

The\ncooling radius, R_cool, defined as the radius at which the cooling time equals\nthe Universe age at given redshift, evolves from ~0.01 R200 at z>2, where the\nstructures begin their evolution, to ~0.05 R200 at z=0. The values measured at\n0.01 R200 show an increase of about 15-20 per cent per Gyr in the gas density\nand surface brightness and a decrease with a mean rate of 10 per cent per Gyr\nin the gas temperature. The emission-weighted temperature diminishes by about\n25 per cent and the bolometric X-ray luminosity rises by a factor ~2 after 10\nGyrs when all the cluster emission is considered in the computation. On the\ncontrary, when the core region within 0.15 R500 is excluded, the gas\ntemperature value does not change and the X-ray luminosity varies by 10-20 per\ncent only. The cooling time and gas entropy radial profiles are well\nrepresented by power-law functions. The behaviour of the inner slopes of the\ngas temperature and density profiles are the most sensitive and unambiguous\ntracers of an evolving cooling core. Their values after 10 Gyrs of radiative\nlosses, T_gas ~ r^0.4 and n_gas ~ r^(-1.2) for the hot (cool) object, are\nremarkably in agreement with the observational constraints available for nearby\nX-ray luminous cooling core clusters. Because our simulations do not consider\nany AGN heating, they imply that the feedback process does not greatly alter\nthe gas density and temperature profiles as generated by radiative cooling\nalone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2008 18:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
