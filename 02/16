We find that Sh2-205\ncan be separated in three independent optical structures: SH 149.25-0.0, SH\n148.83-0.67, and LBN 148.11-0.45. The derived spectral indices show the thermal\nnature of SH 148.83-0.67 and LBN 148.11-0.45. The morphology of SH 148.83-0.67,\nboth in the optical and radio data, along with the energetic requ irements\nindicate that this feature is an interstellar bubble powered by the UV photons\nof HD 24431 (O9 III). LBN 148.11-0.45 has the morphology of a classic al HII\nregion and their ionizing sources remain uncertain. Dust and molecular gas are\nfound related to LBN 148.11-0.45.Particularly, a photodissociation region is\ndetected at the interface between the ionized and molecular regions. If the\nproposed exciting star HD 24094 were an O8--O9 type star, as suggested by its\nnear-infrared colors, its UV photon flux would be enough to explain the\nionization of the nebula. The optical, radio continuum, and 21-cm line data\nallow us to conclude that SH 148.83-0.67 is an interstellar bubble powered by\nthe energetic action of HD 24431. The associated neutral atomic and ionized\nmasses are 180 Mo and 300 Mo, respectively. The emission of SH 149.25-0.0 is\ntoo faint to derive the dust and gas parameters. An HI shell centered at (l,b)\n= (149.0, 1.5) was also identified. It correlates morphologically with\nmolecular gas emission. The neutral atomic and molecular masses are 1600 Mo and\n2.6 x 10^4 Mo, respectively. The open cluster NGC 1444 is the most probable\nresponsible for shaping this HI structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2008 17:08:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2008 15:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

At present, there are four pulsars (B0950+08, B1133+16,\nJ0437-4715, and B0809+74) whose lines of sight seem to lie mainly within the\nlocal bubble. The mean densities and line of sight components of the\ninterstellar magnetic field along these lines of sight are smaller than nominal\nvalues for pulsars, but not by as much expected. Three of the four pulsars also\nhave measurements of interstellar scintillation.

Relying on the FIR-radio\ncorrelation {\\it within} normal galaxies, we use our infrared data to create\nmodel radio maps which we compare to the observed radio images. For 6 of our\nsample galaxies we find regions along their outer edges that are highly\ndeficient in the radio compared with our models. We believe these observations\nare the signatures of ICM ram pressure. For NGC 4522 we find the radio deficit\nregion to lie just exterior to a region of high radio polarization and flat\nradio spectral index, however the total radio continuum in this region does not\nappear significantly enhanced. This scenario seems consistent for other\ngalaxies with radio polarization data in the literature. We also find that\ngalaxies having local radio deficits appear to have enhanced global radio\nfluxes. Our preferred physical picture is that the observed radio deficit\nregions arise from the ICM wind sweeping away cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and the\nassociated magnetic field, thereby creating synchrotron tails observed for some\nof our galaxies. CR particles are also re-accelerated by ICM-driven shocklets\nbehind the observed radio deficit regions which in turn enhances the remaining\nradio disk brightness. The high radio polarization and lack of coincidental\nsignatures in the total synchrotron power in these regions arises from shear,\nand possibly mild compression, as the ICM wind drags and stretches the magnetic\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2008 21:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-19"}

We find that the total stellar mass,\nthe number of star-forming galaxies, and total star-formation rate scale\nlinearly with the number of member galaxies, with no residual dependence on\ncluster velocity dispersion. With the mass-dependence of cluster star-formation\nrates established, we compare the SDSS clusters with a sample of z = 0.75\nclusters from the literature and find that on average the total H-alpha\nluminosity of the high-redshift clusters is 10 times greater than that of the\nlow-redshift clusters. This can be explained by a decline in the H-alpha\nluminosities of individual cluster galaxies by a factor of up to 10 since z =\n0.75. The magnitude of this evolution is comparable to that of field galaxies\nover a similar redshift interval, and thus the effect of the cluster\nenvironment on the evolution of star-forming galaxies is at most modest. Our\nresults suggest that the physical mechanism driving the evolution of cluster\nstar-formation rates is independent of cluster mass, at least for clusters with\nvelocity dispersion greater than 450 km/s, and operates over a fairly long\ntimescale such that the star-formation rates of individual galaxies decline by\nan order of magnitude over ~7 billion years.

Both sequences show the same dependence of the radio-loudness on the\nEddington ratio (an increase with decreasing Eddington ratio), which suggests\nthat another parameter in addition to the accretion rate must play a role in\ndetermining the efficiency of jet production in AGNs.

The simulations show that when the\nquadrupole component is comparable to the dipole component, the magnetic field\nhas a complex structure with three major magnetic poles on the surface of the\nstar and three sets of loops of field lines connecting them. A significant\namount of matter flows to the quadrupole \"belt\", forming a ring-like hot spot\non the star. If the maximum strength of the magnetic field on the star is\nfixed, then we observe that the mass accretion rate, the torque on the star,\nand the area covered by hot spots are several times smaller in the\nquadrupole-dominant cases than in the pure dipole cases. The influence of the\nquadrupole component on the shape of the hot spots becomes noticeable when the\nratio of the quadrupole and dipole field strengths $B_q/B_d\\gtrsim0.5$, and\nbecomes dominant when $B_q/B_d\\gtrsim1$.

In most cases the individual\nnanotubes within a rope have different helicities and 1/3 of them are metallic.\nIn the absence of disorder within the tubes, the intertube electronic transfer\nis negligeable because of the longitudinal wave vector mismatch between\nneighboring tubes of different helicities. The rope can then be considered as a\nnumber of parallel independent ballistic nanotubes. On the other hand, the\npresence of disorder within the tubes favors the intertube electronic transfer.\nThis is first shown using a very simple model where disorder is treated\nperturbatively inspired by the work in reference \\cite{maarouf00}.\n  We then present numerical simulations on a tight binding model of a rope.\nDisorder induced transverse delocalisation shows up as a spectacular increase\nof the sensitivity to the transverse boundary conditions in the presence of\nsmall disorder. This is accompanied by an increase of the longitudinal\nlocalisation length. Implications on the nature of electronic transport within\na rope of carbon nanotubes are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2008 11:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-19"}
