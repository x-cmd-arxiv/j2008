However, the\nstandard measure of local neighborhood clustering is typically not defined if a\nnode has one or no neighbors. In such cases, local clustering has traditionally\nbeen set to zero and this value influenced the global clustering coefficient.\nSuch a procedure leads to underestimation of the neighborhood clustering in\nsparse networks. We propose to include $\\theta$ as the proportion of leafs and\nisolated nodes to estimate the contribution of these cases and provide a\nformula for estimating a clustering coefficient excluding these cases from the\nWatts and Strogatz (1998 Nature 393 440-2) definition of the clustering\ncoefficient.

A recent model (48) predicts bistability due to interactions of\nthe kinases and phosphatases in the MAPK pathway, without feedback from MAPK to\nearlier reactions. Using this model and enzyme concentrations appropriate for\nneurons, we simulated bistable MAPK activity, but bistability only was present\nwithin a relatively narrow range of activity of Raf, the first pathway kinase.\nStochastic fluctuations in molecule numbers eliminated bistability for small\nmolecule numbers, such as are expected in the volume of a dendritic spine.\nHowever, positive feedback loops have been posited from MAPK up to Raf\nactivation. One proposed loop in which MAPK directly activates Raf was\nincorporated into the model. We found that such feedback greatly enhanced the\nrobustness of both stable states of MAPK activity to stochastic fluctuations\nand to parameter variations. Bistability was robust for molecule numbers\nplausible for a dendritic spine volume. The upper state of MAPK activity was\nresistant to inhibition of MEK activation for > 1 h, suggesting inhibitor\nexperiments have not sufficed to rule out a role for persistent MAPK activity\nin LTP maintenance. These simulations suggest that persistent MAPK activity and\nconsequent upregulation of translation may contribute to LTP maintenance and to\nlong-term memory.

The presence of dispersion means that the energy density\ncontains terms of the form $d[\\omega\\epsilon(\\omega)] /d\\omega$ and\n$d[\\omega\\mu(\\omega)] /d\\omega$.

It produces a bimodal distribution, in which passive galaxies\n(highlighted by morphological early-types) define a tight MIR colour sequence\n(Infrared Passive Sequence, IPS). This is due to stellar atmospheric emission\nfrom old stellar populations. Significantly offset from the IPS are galaxies\nwhere reemission by dust boosts emission at 8microns (InfraRed-Excess or IRE\ngalaxies). They include all known morphological late-types. Comparison with\nEW[OII] shows that MIR colour is highly sensitive to low levels of activity,\nand allows us to separate dusty-active from passive galaxies. The fraction of\nIRE galaxies, f(IRE) drops with M_*, such that f(IRE)=0.5 at a ``crossover\nmass'' of ~1.3x10^11M_sol. Within our optically-defined group sample there is a\nstrong and consistent deficit in f(IRE) at all masses, and most clearly at M_*\n>~10^11M_sol. Using a mock galaxy catalogue derived from the Millenium\nSimulation we show that the observed trend of f(IRE) with M_* can be explained\nif suppression of star formation occurs primarily in the group environment, and\nparticularly for M_*>~10^11M_sol galaxies. In this way, downsizing can be\ndriven solely by structure growth in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2008 21:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The goal is to compute the minimum possible\nnumber guards placed on the vertices of a simple polygon in such a way that\nthey cover the interior of the polygon.\n  In this paper we consider the problem of guarding an art gallery which is\nmodeled as a polygon with curvilinear walls. Our main focus is on polygons the\nedges of which are convex arcs pointing towards the exterior or interior of the\npolygon (but not both), named piecewise-convex and piecewise-concave polygons.\nWe prove that, in the case of piecewise-convex polygons, if we only allow\nvertex guards, $\\lfloor\\frac{4n}{7}\\rfloor-1$ guards are sometimes necessary,\nand $\\lfloor\\frac{2n}{3}\\rfloor$ guards are always sufficient.

It has been suggested that\nthis spectrum forms as the thermal photons emitted by the star surface traverse\nthe magnetosphere. Magnetar magnetospheres are likely different from those of\nordinary radio-pulsars, since the external magnetic field may acquire a\ntoroidal component as a consequence of the deformation of the star crust\ninduced by the super-strong interior field.

Keeping this result in mind, we then exhibit upper bounds on\nthe simple regret of some forecasters. The paper ends with a study devoted to\ncontinuous-armed bandit problems; we show that the simple regret can be\nminimized with respect to a family of probability distributions if and only if\nthe cumulative regret can be minimized for it. Based on this equivalence, we\nare able to prove that the separable metric spaces are exactly the metric\nspaces on which these regrets can be minimized with respect to the family of\nall probability distributions with continuous mean-payoff functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2008 14:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2008 07:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 07:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 10:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2010 10:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2010 09:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-26"}

We derive the high-state soft X-ray flux\nand short-term spectral variability of AM Her using a new detector response\nmatrix and a confirmed flux calibration of the ROSAT PSPC below 0.28 keV. The\nbest-fit mean single-blackbody temperature and integrated bright-phase energy\nflux of AM Her in its April 1991 high state are 27.2 +/- 1.0 eV and (2.6 +/-\n0.6) x 10^-9 erg cm^-2s^-1, respectively. The total blackbody flux of a\nmulti-temperature model that fits both the soft X-ray and the fluctuating\nfar-ultraviolet components is Fbb = (4.5 +/- 1.5) x 10^-9 erg cm^-2s^-1. The\ntotal accretion luminosity at a distance of 80 pc, Lbb = (2.1 +/- 0.7) x 10^33\nerg s-1, implies an accretion rate of Mdot = (2.4 +/- 0.8) x 10^-10 Msun yr^-1\nfor an 0.78 Msun white dwarf. The soft X-ray flux displays significant\nvariability on time scales down to 200 ms. Correlated spectral and count-rate\nvariations are seen in flares on time scales down to 1 s, demonstrating the\nheating and cooling associated with individual accretion events.

The nearly edge-on inclination of L1527 IRS, coupled with the highly\nspatially-resolved near to mid-infrared images of this object and the detailed\nIRS spectrum, enable us to constrain the outflow cavity geometry quite well,\nreducing uncertainties in the other derived parameters. The mid-infrared\nscattered light image shows a bright central source within a dark lane; the\naspect ratio of this dark lane is such that it appears highly unlikely to be a\ndisk shadow. In modeling this dark lane, we conclude that L1527 IRS is probably\nnot described by a standard TSC envelope with simple bipolar cavities. We find\nit necessary to model the dark lane and central source as a modified inner\nenvelope structure. This structure may be due either to a complex wind-envelope\ninteraction or induced by the central binary. To fit the overall SED, we\nrequire the central source to have a large near to mid-infrared excess,\nsuggesting substantial disk accretion. Our model reproduces the overall\nmorphology and surface brightness distribution of L1527 IRS fairly well, given\nthe limitations of using axisymmetric models to fit the non-axisymmetric real\nobject, and the derived envelope infall rates are in reasonable agreement with\nsome other investigations. IRAC observations of L1527 IRS taken 12 months apart\nshow variability in total flux and variability in the opposing bipolar\ncavities, suggesting asymmetric variations in accretion. We also provide model\nimages at high resolution for comparison to future observations with current\nground-based instrumentation and future space-based telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2008 15:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In\ncompounds that exhibit magnetic compensation, one of the doublets was predicted\nto lie lowest in energy and carry a non-quenched orbital angular momentum $\\pm\n\\ld $, where $\\ld $ exceeds a threshold value. In a range of $\\ld $, a\nJahn-Teller (JT) distortion increases the energy splitting of the low-lying\ndoublet and breaks the C$_3$ symmetry of the bimetallic planes around the\nferrimagnetic transition temperature. At low temperatures, the JT distortion\ndisappears in compounds that display magnetic compensation due to the\ncompetition with the spin-orbit coupling. A comparison with recent measurements\nprovides strong evidence for this re-entrant, low-temperature JT transition and\na prediction for the normal, high-temperature JT transition. The size of the JT\ndistortion is estimated using first-principles calculations, which suggest that\nthe long-range ordering of smaller, non-C$_3$-symmetric organic cations can\neliminate magnetic compensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2008 15:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
