We show that in\nthe limit where spins residing on b-trimers have Ising character, quantum\nfluctuations of XXZ spins residing on the a-trimers can be exactly accounted\nfor in the absence of applied field. This is accomplished through a mapping to\nthe kagome Ising model, for which exact analytic solutions exist. We derive the\ncomplete finite temperature phase diagram for this XXZ-Ising model, including\nthe residual zero temperature entropies of the seven ground state phases.\nWhereas the disordered (spin liquid) ground state of the pure Ising TKL model\nhas macroscopic residual entropy ln72=4.2767... per unit cell, the introduction\nof transverse(quantum) couplings between neighboring $a$-spins reduces this\nentropy to 2.5258... per unit cell. In the presence of applied magnetic field,\nwe map the TKL XXZ-Ising model to the kagome Ising model with three-spin\ninteractions, and derive the ground state phase diagram. A small (or even\ninfinitesimal) field leads to a new phase that corresponds to a\nnon-intersecting loop gas on the kagome lattice, with entropy 1.4053... per\nunit cell and a mean magnetization for the b-spins of 0.12(1) per site. In\naddition, we find that for moderate applied field, there is a critical spin\nliquid phase which maps to close-packed dimers on the honeycomb lattice, which\nsurvives even when the a-spins are in the Heisenberg limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2008 20:46:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 May 2008 21:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-24"}

The fraction of merging galaxy\npairs at each time-step of the simulation is derived from the galaxy catalogues\nobtained by the models and the results are compared with various observational\nestimates of merger fractions taken from the literature. We find a good match\nbetween the pair fractions derived from the simulation and the observed\ncounting of galaxy pairs obtained by different sources in the redshift range 0\n< z < 1.2. The predicted evolution of the number of galaxy mergers per Gyr\ngrows with redshift as an exponential rate proportional to (1+z)^m, with m\nranging from 0.6 to 0.8 for 0 < z < 2, depending on the luminosity and mass\nratios of the merging galaxies.

The weak evolution predicted for the galaxy merger rate\nin an hierarchical model universe shows that the mass assembly evolution of\ngalaxies through mergers does not follow the rapid evolution of the halo merger\nrate obtained in previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2008 16:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-21"}

Here we report results for the first 6 masks\n(out of 10 total) that have been analyzed from each of the LR-Blue and MR\ngrisms. Spectra of 2344 spectra have been extracted from these 6 LR-Blue masks\nand 968 from 6 MR masks. 33% of the LR-Blue and 18% of the MR spectra are\nserendipitous observations.

The completeness level is very\nhigh, > 60%, at z < 3.5, and it is very uncertain at higher redshift.

This is\nsurprising because tidal interactions with Pluto are too weak to damp their\neccentricities. We consider an alternative possibility: that Nix and Hydra\ncircularize their orbits by exciting Charon's eccentricity via secular\ninteractions, and Charon in turn damps its own eccentricity by tidal\ninteraction with Pluto. The timescale for this process can be less than the age\nof the Solar System, for plausible tidal parameters and moon masses. However,\nas we show numerically and analytically, the effects of the 2:1 and 3:1\nresonant forcing terms between Nix and Charon complicate this picture. In the\npresence of Charon's tidal damping, the 2:1 term forces Nix to migrate outward\nand the 3:1 term changes the eccentricity damping rate, sometimes leading to\neccentricity growth. We conclude that this mechanism probably does not explain\nNix and Hydra's current orbits. Instead, we suggest that they were formed\nin-situ with low eccentricities.\n  We also show that an upper limit on Nix's migration speed sets a lower limit\non Pluto-Charon's tidal circularization timescale of >10^5 yrs. Moreover,\nHydra's observed proper eccentricity may be explained by the 3:2 forcing by\nNix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2008 21:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-22"}

The tail spectrum fits an absorbed\npower-law (PL) model with the photon index of 2.3\\pm0.2, corresponding to the\n0.5-8 keV luminosity of 1*10^{33} ergs s^{-1}, for n_H= 2.1*10^{22} cm^{-2}.\nThe tail of PSR J1740+1000 is firmly detected up to 5' (2 pc at a 1.4 kpc\ndistance), with a flux of 6*10^{-14} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} in 0.4-10 keV. The PL\nfit yields photon index of 1.4-1.5 and n_H=1*10^{21} cm^{-2}.

The comparison between the J1509 and J1740\ntails and the X-ray tails of other pulsars shows that the X-ray radiation\nefficiency correlates poorly with the pulsar spin-down luminosity or age.

The system is\nconventional, i.e., it does not make use of joint cell-site processing. A hard\nfairness (HF) system serves all users with the same rate in any channel state.\nIn contrast, a system based on proportional fairness serves the users with\nvariable instantaneous rates depending on their channel state. We compare these\ntwo options in terms of the system spectral efficiency \\textsf{C} (bit/s/Hz)\nversus $E_b/N_0$. Proportional fair scheduling (PFS) performs generally better\nthan the more restrictive HF system in the regime of low to moderate SNR, but\nfor high SNR an optimized HF system achieves throughput comparable to that of\nPFS system for finite $K$. The hard-fairness system is interference limited. We\ncharacterize this limit and validate a commonly used simplified model that\ntreats outer cell interference power as proportional to the in-cell total power\nand we analytically characterize the proportionality constant. In contrast, the\nspectral efficiency of PFS can grow unbounded for $K \\to \\infty$ thanks to the\nmultiuser diversity effect.

Very different areas of physics such as, for example, electrodynamics\nand quantum transport, can profit from this Green's function formalism.

By parameterizing the evolution of the pair fraction as\n(1+z)^{m}, we find that the companion rate increases mildly with redshift with\nm = 0.41+-0.20 for all galaxies with -21 < M_B^{e} < -19. Blue galaxies show\nslightly faster evolution in the blue companion rate with m = 1.27+-0.35 while\nred galaxies have had fewer red companions in the past as evidenced by the\nnegative slope m = -0.92+-0.59. We find that at low redshift the pair fraction\nwithin the red sequence exceeds that of the blue cloud, indicating a higher\nmerger probability among red galaxies compared to that among the blue galaxies.\nWith further assumptions on the merger timescale and the fraction of pairs that\nwill merge, the galaxy major merger rates for 0.1 < z <1.2 are estimated to be\n~10^{-3}h^{3}Mpc^{-3}Gyr^{-1} with a factor of 2 uncertainty. At z ~ 1.1, 68%\nof mergers are wet, 8% of mergers are dry, and 24% of mergers are mixed,\ncompared to 31% wet mergers, 25% dry mergers, and 44% mixed mergers at z ~ 0.1.\nThe growth of dry merger rates with decreasing redshift is mainly due to the\nincrease in the co-moving number density of red galaxies over time. About 22%\nto 54% of present-day L^{*} galaxies have experienced major mergers since z ~\n1.2, depending on the definition of major mergers. Moreover, 24% of the red\ngalaxies at the present epoch have had dry mergers with luminosity ratios\nbetween 1:4 and 4:1 since z ~ 1.

To\ninvestigate the nature M1-78 further, we present a detailed spectroscopic study\nof M1-78 in the optical and near-infrared. M1-78 is a high-density nebula with\nsubstantial physical differences between its two main morphological zones: a\nbright arc to the SW and a blob of emission in the NE. Specifically, the blob\nin the NE has a higher electron temperature and visual extinction than the SW\narc. The most important result, however, is the confirmation of a nitrogen\nenrichment in M1-78. This enrichment is stronger at the location of the NE blob\nand is correlated with a defficiency in the O abundance and a (dubious) He\nenrichment. Such an abundance pattern is typical of ejecta nebulae around\nevolved massive stars such as Wolf-Rayet and Luminous Blue Variable stars. The\nspatial variations in the physical conditions and chemical abundances and the\npresence of more than one possible ionizing source indicates, however, that\nM1-78 is better described as a combination of a compact HII region + ejecta.\nFinally, we detect H2 emission that extends over a large (~30 arcsec) area\naround the ionized nebula.

We confirm a number of well known scaling\npredictions and analyse their range of validity by means of comprehensive\nMolecular Dynamics simulations using a coarse-grained bead-spring model of a\nflexible polymer chain.\n  The normal and parallel components of the average end-to-end distance, mean\nradius of gyration and their distributions, the density profile, the force\nexerted on the slit walls, and the local bond orientation characteristics are\nobtained in slits of width $D$ = $4 \\div 10$ (in units of the bead radius) and\nfor chain lengths $N=50 \\div 300$. We demonstrate that a wide range of static\nchain properties in normal direction can be described {\\em quantitatively} by\nanalytic model - independent expressions in perfect agreement with computer\nexperiment. In particular, the observed profile of confinement-induced bond\norientation, is shown to closely match theory predictions.\n  The anisotropy of confinement is found to be manifested most dramatically in\nthe dynamic behavior of the polymer chain. We examine the relation between\ncharacteristic times for translational diffusion and lateral relaxation. It is\ndemonstrated that the scaling predictions for lateral and normal relaxation\ntimes are in good agreement with our observations. A novel feature is the\nobserved coupling of normal and lateral modes with two vastly different\nrelaxation times. We show that the impact of grafting on lateral relaxation is\nequivalent to doubling the chain length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2008 14:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The flatness of the Lagrangian\nacceleration as a function of the radius shows that the influence of the wall\non the Lagrangian dynamics becomes negligible in the center of the domain and\nit also reveals that the wall is responsible for the increased intermittency.\nThe transition in the Lagrangian statistics between this region, not directly\ninfluenced by the walls, and a critical radius which defines a Lagrangian\nboundary layer, is shown to be very sharp with a sudden increase of the\nacceleration flatness from about 5 to about 20.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2008 15:49:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-25"}

When membranes are prepared from a ternary lipid\nmixture at a critical composition, they pass through a miscibility critical\npoint at the transition temperature. Since the critical temperature is\ntypically on the order of room temperature, membranes provide an unusual\nopportunity in which to perform a quantitative study of biophysical systems\nthat exhibit critical phenomena in the two-dimensional Ising universality\nclass. As a critical point is approached from either high or low temperature,\nthe scale of fluctuations in lipid composition, set by the correlation length,\ndiverges. In addition, as a critical point is approached from low temperature,\nthe line tension between coexisting phases decreases to zero. Here we\nquantitatively evaluate the temperature dependence of line tension between\nliquid domains and of fluctuation correlation lengths in lipid membranes in\norder to extract a critical exponent, nu. We obtain nu=1.2 plus or minus 0.2,\nconsistent with the Ising model prediction nu=1. We also evaluate the\nprobability distributions of pixel intensities in fluoresence images of\nmembranes. From the temperature dependence of these distributions above the\ncritical temperature, we extract an independent critical exponent beta=0.124\nplus or minus 0.03 which is consistent with the Ising prediction of beta=1/8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2008 19:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-08"}
