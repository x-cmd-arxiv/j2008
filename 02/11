It is shown that all source-free potentials differ in the flux\nthrough the throat (no \"multipoles without multipoles\"), which enables one to\ninterpret the flux as the \"charge\" of the wormhole in agreement with Wheeler's\nconcept of \"charge without charge\". The potential generated by the charge\ndiffers from Coulomb's and thus a force (called \"self-force\") acts on the\ncharge even in the absence of the source-free field.

Its contradictions were caused not by the orbit concept but by a mental\nbarrier--the inconceivability that an electron might collide with the atomic\nnucleus. Removing that barrier resolves the theory's main failures--incorrect\norbital momenta, He atom, H2+ molecule ion. The inclusion of electron\noscillations through the nucleus--a concept called \"Coulomb\noscillator\"--renders the old quantum theory consistent with quantum mechanics\n(although devoid of wave character). The triple success of the Bohr-Sommerfeld\nmodel is its correct description of the H atom (and one-electron ions)\nconcerning (1) the energy levels Enl, (2) the orbital angular momenta Lnl--if\ncorrected as Lnl^2 = l(l+1) hbar^2 and with the Coulomb oscillator\nincluded--and (3) the orbits' space quantization--with (Lnl)z = ml hbar.

Orbit geometry also\naccounts for the average orbit size. Moreover, the Coulomb oscillator provides\na natural explanation of (isotropic) hyperfine interaction. The shortcomings of\nthe old quantum theory lie in its neglect of three properties of\nparticles--their spin, their wave nature and their quantum statistics.

Matched filtering is the optimal\ndetection strategy for stationary, Gaussian noise, however, LIGO noise is often\nnon-stationary, non-Gaussian. Non-stationary noise result in an excess of false\ncandidate events, commonly known as false alarms. This thesis develops the r^2\ntest to reduce the false alarm rate for LIGO CBC searches. Results of the\nsearch for primordial black hole binary systems (where each object has less\nthan 1M_solar), in LIGO's Third Science Run (S3) is also presented.\n  Results of the r^2 test are shown for several LIGO CBC searches, including\nthe binary neutron star searches in the Third and Fourth Science Runs (S3/S4),\nthe S3/S4 primordial black hole searches, and the binary black hole search in\nthe first three months of the Fifth Science Run (S5).

In most mammals, it\nis coiled as a spiral. Whether this specific shape influences hearing is still\nan open problem. By employing a three dimensional fluid model of the cochlea\nwith an idealized geometry, the influence of the spiral geometry of the cochlea\nis examined. We obtain solutions of the model through a conformal\ntransformation in a long-wave approximation. Our results show that the net\npressure acting on the basilar membrane is not uniform along its spanwise\ndirection. Also, it is shown that the location of the maximum of the spanwise\npressure difference in the axial direction has a mode dependence. In the\nsimplest pattern, the present result is consistent with the previous theory\nbased on the WKB-like approximation [D. Manoussaki, Phys. Rev. Lett. 96,\n088701(2006)]. In this mode, the pressure difference in the spanwise direction\nis a monotonic function of the distance from the apex and the normal velocity\nacross the channel width is zero. Thus in the lowest order approximation, we\ncan neglect the existance of the Reissner's membrane in the upper channel.\nHowever, higher responsive modes show different behavior and, thus, the real\nmaximum is expected to be located not exactly at the apex, but at a position\ndetermined by the spiral geometry of the cochlea and the width of the cochlear\nduct. In these modes, the spanwise normal velocities are not zero. Thus, it\nindicates that one should take into account of the detailed geometry of the\ncochlear duct for a more quantitative result. The present result clearly\ndemonstrates that not only the spiral geometry, but also the geometry of the\ncochlear duct play decisive roles in distributing the wave energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2008 05:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-12"}

We present the cluster-model ab initio study of these\noptical phonons based on the Hartree-Fock SCF calculation with the 3-21G basic\nset. The obtained results showed very good agreement with the observed data.\nThe Cu-O resonances generally showed the lower shifts in Ca2CuO3 than in pure\nCuO and were primarily composed of the vibrations of the oxygen in static host\nlattice whereas the Cu movements happened only in the collective lattice\nvibrations. Almost complete classification of the forbidden phonons is\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2008 11:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-12"}

In this study, some algebraic properties of non-WIP Osborn\nloops have been investigated in a broad manner. Huthnance was able to deduce\nsome algebraic properties of Osborn loops with the WIP i.e universal weak\nWIPLs. So this work exempts the WIP. Two new loop identities, namely left self\ninverse property loop(LSIPL) identity and right self inverse property\nloop(RSLPL) are introduced for the first time and it is shown that in an Osborn\nloop, they are equivalent. A CC-loop is shown to be power associative if and\nonly if it is a RSLPL or LSIPL. Among the few identities that have been\nestablished for Osborn loops, one of them is recognized and recommended for\ncryptography in a similar spirit in which the cross inverse property has been\nused by Keedwell following the fact that it was observed that Osborn loops that\ndo not have the LSIP or RSIP or 3-PAPL or weaker forms of inverse property,\npower associativity and diassociativity to mention a few, will have cycles(even\nlong ones).

We observe spatially extended line emission\n(up to 20 kpc) in the majority of sources which is consistent with a quiescent\nhalo. In the nuclear apertures we observe broad, highly complex emission line\nprofiles. Multiple Gaussian modelling of the [O III]5007 line reveals 2-4\ncomponents which can have FWHM and blueshifts relative to the halo of up to\n2000 km/s. We interpret these broad, blueshifted components as material in\noutflow and discuss the kinematical evidence for jet-driven outflows.\nComparisons with samples in the literature show that compact radio sources\nharbour more extreme nuclear kinematics than their extended counterparts, a\ntrend seen within our sample with larger velocities in the smaller sources. The\nobserved velocities are also likely to be influenced by source orientation with\nrespect to the observer's line of sight. Nine sources have associated HI\nabsorption. In common with the optical emission line gas, the HI profiles are\noften highly complex with the majority of the detected components significantly\nblueshifted, tracing outflows in the neutral gas.
