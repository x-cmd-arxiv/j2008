Focusing on the simplest models proposed so\nfar, in this paper we study the relation existing between the two scenarios,\nisolating the Weyl scaling which allows to express them in the EF and JF.\nMoreover, we perform a comparative study of the behavior of linear\nperturbations in both scenarios, which turn out to behave in a markedly\ndifferent way. In particular, while the clustering is enhanced in the\nconsidered CQ models with respect to the corresponding Quintessence ones where\nthe coupling is absent and to the ordinary cosmologies with a Cosmological\nConstant and Cold Dark Matter (LCDM), structures in EQ models may grow slower.\nThis is likely to have direct consequences on the inner properties of\nnon-linear structures, like cluster concentration, as well as on the weak\nlensing shear on large scales. Finally, we specialize our study for interfacing\nlinear dynamics and N-body simulations in these cosmologies, giving a recipe\nfor the corrections to be included in N-body codes in order to take into\naccount the modifications to the expansion rate, growth of structures, and\nstrength of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2008 16:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 May 2008 15:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

This low frequency radio band is one of the few\nlargely unexplored regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The sensitivity and\nangular resolution offered by LOFAR will be two to three orders of magnitude\nbetter than existing telescopes, and as such it will open up this new window on\nthe Universe. LOFAR will impact on a broad range of astrophysics, from\ncosmology to solar system studies.\n  There is growing European involvement in LOFAR, driven by the need to add\nstations far from the main core in order to improve angular resolution.\nLOFAR-UK is a project aimed at cementing UK participation in LOFAR via the\noperation of four stations within the UK. LOFAR-UK ground stations will allow\nLOFAR observations to reach sub-arcsecond scales at the highest frequencies,\nand as a result will also improve the (confusion-limited) sensitivity limit of\nthe telescope for deep surveys.\n  LOFAR-UK will achieve involvement for UK astronomers in a world-leading\nscience facility operating in the immediate future. It will allow the UK to\nbuild up important scientific and technical expertise in `next generation'\nradio astronomy in preparation for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), and will\nplay an important role in broadening the UK community that has an interest in\nradio astronomy. This White Paper outlines the strategic importance to the UK\nastronomy community of gaining involvement in the LOFAR project, the scientific\ninterests of UK researchers in using the telescope, and the technical\nchallenges that will need to be overcome [abridged].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2008 17:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-11"}

Interferometric observations at 2.6\nmm show the presence of a high-velocity CO outflow and a continuum source also\nwith a faint extension, both of which are aligned with the optical jet\nstructure. IRAS 05506 is most likely not a PPN. We find extended NH3 (1,1)\nemission towards IRAS 05506; these data together with the combined presence of\nfar-IR emission, H2O and OH masers, and CO and CS J=2-1 emission, strongly\nargue for a dense, dusty star-forming core associated with IRAS 05506. IRAS\n05506 is probably an intermediate-mass or massive protostar, and the very short\ntime-scale (200 yr) of its outflows indicates that it is very young. If IRAS\n05506 is a massive star, then the lack of radio continuum and the late G --\nearly K spectral type we find from our optical spectra implies that in this\nobject we are witnessing the earliest stages of its life, while its temperature\nis still too low to provide sufficient UV flux for ionisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2008 19:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The long-range\nordered collinear spins of the insulating antiferromagnet are replaced by a\ncommensurate central mode arising from slow, isotropically polarized,\nshort-range spin correlations. The inelastic spectrum up to 30 meV is broad in\nwave vector and commensurate. In contrast to the the resonance peak of higher\nTc superconductors, the spins exhibit a single overdamped spectrum whose rate\nof relaxation decreases on cooling and saturates at 5 meV below 50 K. As the\nrelaxation rate saturates the quasi-static spin correlations grow and become\nresolution limited in energy. The spin susceptibility at high temperatures\nillustrates that the dominant energy scale is set by the temperature. At low\ntemperatures, the scale length is geometric and not linked by velocity to\ndynamic widths. There is no observable suppression of the spin fluctuations or\ncentral mode upon the onset of superconductivity. The spins respond not to\ncoherent charge pairs but to hole doping allowing coexistence of glassy short\nrange spin order with superconductivity. Since the physics of the weakly\nsuperconducting system YBCO6.35 must connect continuously with that in more\nstrongly superconducting YBCO6.5, we find that neither incommensurate\nstripe-like spin modulations nor a well-defined neutron spin resonance are\nessential for the onset with doping of pairing in a high temperature cuprate\nsuperconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2008 09:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
