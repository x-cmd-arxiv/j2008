Since Mercury's precession was a directly derived\nresult of the full general theory, it was viewed by Einstein as the most\ncritical test of general relativity, amongst the three tests proposed by him.\nWith the advent of the space age, the observational accuracy level has improved\nfurther and it became possible to detect this precession for other planetary\norbits of the solar system -- viz., Venus and the Earth. This conclusively\nproved that the phenomenon of 'anomalous' perihelion precession of planetary\norbits is really a relativistic effect.

Fitting a total of ~1100 photons, we show that the X-ray spectrum of\nthe J0737-3039 system is very soft, and not satisfactorily modeled by a simple\nblackbody or an atmospheric model. However, it is not possible yet to\ndiscriminate between a predominantly non-thermal and a predominantly thermal\norigin for the X-ray emission. Adopting a simple power-law emission model, the\nphoton index (Gamma=3.7) and the implied conversion efficiency of the\nrotational energy of PSR J0737-3039A into X-ray emission (4.1x10^-4, for a\ndistance to the source of 500 pc) are compatible with the X-ray photons being\nemitted in the magnetosphere of PSR J0737-3039A. This hypothesis is also\nsupported by the absence of detectable X-ray orbital modulation (up to ~20%) or\nany X-ray nebular emission and it is in agreement with the high (~75%) X-ray\npulsed fraction of PSR J0737-3039A. A two blackbody or a Comptonized blackbody\nmodel also reproduce the data, and the upper limit to the value of the hydrogen\ncolumn density N_H <10^20 cm^-2, is in better agreement (with respect to the\npower-law model) with the Galactic N_H in that direction and at that distance.\nFor the two blackbody model the implied emission radii and temperatures are\nalso compatible with those seen in other recycled pulsars, calling for the bulk\nof the X-ray photons being originated from heated regions at the surface of\npulsar A. On the other hand, in the Comptonized blackbody model, the electron\ntemperature seems to be significantly smaller than in other similar objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2008 20:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2008 17:29:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2008 10:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Among those, long baseline experiments will play a crucial role in\nproviding information on the value of theta13, the type of neutrino mass\nordering and on the value of the CP-violating phase delta, which enters in\n3-neutrino oscillations. Here, we consider a beta-beam setup with an\nintermediate Lorentz factor gamma=450 and a baseline of 1050 km. This could be\nachieved in Europe with a beta-beam sourced at CERN to a detector located at\nthe Boulby mine in the United Kingdom. We analyse the physics potential of this\nsetup in detail and study two different exposures (1 x 10^{21} and 5 x 10^{21}\nions-kton-years). In both cases, we find that the type of neutrino mass\nhierarchy could be determined at 99% CL, for all values of delta, for sin^2(2\ntheta13) > 0.03. In the high-exposure scenario, we find that the value of the\nCP-violating phase delta could be measured with a 99% CL error of ~20 deg if\nsin^2 (2 theta13) > 10^{-3}, with some sensitivity down to values of sin^2(2\ntheta13) ~ 10^{-4}. The ability to determine the octant of theta23 is also\nstudied, and good prospects are found for the high-statistics scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2008 15:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-19"}
