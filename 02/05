These rates become\nself-consistent within EPS once we realize that the typical merger in the limit\nof a small time-step involves more than two progenitors, contrary to the\nassumption of binary mergers adopted in earlier studies. We present a general\nmethod for computing merger rates that span the range of solutions permitted by\nthe EPS conditional mass function, and focus on a specific solution that\nattempts to match the merger rates in N-body simulations. The corrected EPS\nmerger rates are more accurate than the earlier estimates of Lacey & Cole, by\n~20% for major mergers and by up to a factor of ~3 for minor mergers of mass\nratio 1:10^4. Based on the revised merger rates, we provide a new algorithm for\nconstructing Monte-Carlo EPS merger trees, that could be useful in\nSemi-Analytic Modeling. We provide analytic expressions and plot numerical\nresults for several quantities that are very useful in studies of galaxy\nformation. This includes (a) the rate of mergers of a given mass ratio per\ngiven final halo, (b) the fraction of mass added by mergers to a halo, and (c)\nthe rate of mergers per given main progenitor. The creation and destruction\nrates of haloes serve for a self-consistency check. Our method for computing\nmerger rates can be applied to conditional mass functions beyond EPS, such as\nthose obtained by the ellipsoidal collapse model or extracted from $N$-body\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2008 18:15:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 May 2008 07:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The presence of these gradients may\nlead to the appearance of currents in the plasma, which in the weakly\ncollisional corona can constitute sources of free energy for driving\nmicro-instabilities. Such instabilities are very important since they represent\na possible source of ion-cyclotron waves which have been conjectured to play a\nprominent role in coronal heating, but whose solar origin remains unclear.\nConsidering a density stratification transverse to the magnetic field, this\npaper aims at studying the possible occurrence of gradient-induced plasma\nmicro-instabilities under typical conditions of coronal holes. Taking into\naccount the WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, we perform a Fourier\nplane waves analysis using the collisionless multi-fluid model. By neglecting\nthe electron inertia, this model allows us to take into account ion-cyclotron\nwave effects that are absent from the one-fluid model of magnetohydrodynamics\n(MHD). Realistic models of density and temperature, as well as a 2-D analytical\nmagnetic-field model, are used to define the background plasma in the\nopen-field funnel in a polar coronal hole. The ray-tracing theory is used to\ncompute the ray path of the unstable waves, as well as the evolution of their\ngrowth rates during the propagation. We demonstrate that in typical coronal\nhole conditions, and when assuming typical transverse density length scales\ntaken from radio observations, the current generated by a relative electron-ion\ndrift provides enough free energy for driving the mode unstable. This\ninstability results from a coupling between oppositely propagating slow-mode\nwaves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2008 16:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This is the first in a series of papers that\nadopts a dynamical systems approach to the study of Kerr orbits, beginning with\nequatorial orbits. We define a taxonomy of orbits that hinges on a\ncorrespondence between periodic orbits and rational numbers. The taxonomy\ndefines the entire dynamics, including aperiodic motion, since every orbit is\nin or near the periodic set. A remarkable implication of this periodic orbit\ntaxonomy is that the simple precessing ellipse familiar from planetary orbits\nis not allowed in the strong-field regime. Instead, eccentric orbits trace out\nprecessions of multi-leaf clovers in the final stages of inspiral. Furthermore,\nfor any black hole, there is some point in the strong-field regime past which\nzoom-whirl behavior becomes unavoidable.

However the consensus on a homogeneous matter structure, even on\nvery large scales, has never been complete. The advantage of correlation\ndimension calculations is that they enable one to obtain the transition scale\nto a homogeneous distribution, whereas other methods, such as those using the\ntwo-point correlation function, make it hard to exhibit the possible fractal\nproperties of the Universe matter content. Our purpose is to calculate the\ncorrelation dimension $D_2$, looking for a possible transition to homogeneity,\nwhich would imply $D_2 = 3$. We apply the correlation integral method to the\nthree dimensional sample composed of 332,876 galaxies which we extract from the\nFifth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

Using volume limited samples for this range leaves us with about\n20,000 galaxies. Applying our method to random maps helps us to calibrate our\nresults. We obtain a correlation dimension of the galaxy distribution which\nseems to increase with scales up to $D_2=3$ reached around 70 Mpc. The results\nof our analysis, performed on the largest volume limited sample which can be\nextracted from the SDSS catalog, are compatible with those formerly obtained by\nother authors.

By employing the standard analysis of flat directions we present a\nquasi--realistic three generation string model in which stringent F- and D-flat\nsolution do not appear to exist to all orders in the superpotential.

If our assertion is\ncorrect, this model may represent the first known example with vanishing\ncosmological constant and perturbatively broken supersymmetry. We discuss the\ndistinctive properties of the internal free fermion boundary conditions that\nmay correspond to a large set of models that share these properties.

We are mainly\nconsidering higher spin gauge fields in their own right as free-standing\ntheoretical constructs and not circumstances where they occur as part of\nanother system. Considering the problem of introducing interactions among\nhigher spin gauge fields, there has historically been two broad avenues of\napproach. One approach entails gauging a non-Abelian global symmetry algebra,\nin the process making it local. The other approach entails deforming an already\nlocal but Abelian gauge algebra, in the process making it non-Abelian. In cases\nwhere both avenues have been explored, such as for spin 1 and 2 gauge fields,\nthe results agree (barring conceptual and technical issues) with Yang-Mills\ntheory and Einstein gravity. In the case of an infinite tower of higher spin\ngauge fields, the first approach has been thoroughly developed and explored by\nM. Vasiliev, whereas the second approach, after having lain dormant for a long\ntime, has received new attention by several authors lately. In the present\npaper we briefly review some aspects of the history of higher spin gauge fields\nas a backdrop to an attempt at comparing the gauging vs. deforming approaches.\nA common unifying structure of strongly homotopy Lie algebras underlying both\napproaches will be discussed. The modern deformation approach, using BRST-BV\nmethods, will be described as far as it is developed at the present time.

Previous studies have found two X-ray cavities in the central\nregions of A4059 together with a ridge of X-ray emission 20kpc south-west of\nthe cluster center. These features are clearly related to the radio galaxy\nPKS2354-35 which resides in the cD galaxy.

The unusual morphology, temperature structure and\nmetal distribution all point to significant asymmetry in the ICM atmosphere\nprior to the onset of radio-galaxy activity. Motivated by the very high\nmetalicity of the SW ridge, we hypothesize that the ICM asymmetry was caused by\nthe extremely rapid stripping of metal enriched gas from a starburst galaxy\nthat plunged through the core of A4059. Furthermore, we suggest that the onset\nof powerful radio-galaxy activity in the cD galaxy may have been initiated by\nthis starburst/stripping event, either via the tidal-shocking of cold gas\nnative to the cD galaxy, or the accretion of cold gas that had been stripped\nfrom the starburst galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2008 21:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The aim\nof this modelling is to examine the possibility of large-scale core expansion\nin massive star clusters and search for a viable dynamical origin for the\nradius-age trend observed for such objects in the Magellanic Clouds. We\nidentify two physical processes which can lead to significant and prolonged\ncluster core expansion: mass-loss due to rapid stellar evolution in a\nprimordially mass segregated cluster, and heating due to a retained population\nof stellar-mass black holes. These two processes operate over different\ntime-scales - the former occurs only at early times and cannot drive core\nexpansion for longer than a few hundred Myr, while the latter typically does\nnot begin until several hundred Myr have passed but can result in core\nexpansion lasting for many Gyr. We investigate the behaviour of these expansion\nmechanisms in clusters with varying degrees of primordial mass segregation and\nin clusters with varying black hole retention fractions.

The\nAdS/CFT correspondence also provides insights into the inherently\nnonperturbative aspects of QCD such as the orbital and radial spectra of\nhadrons and the form of hadronic wavefunctions. In particular, we show that\nthere is an exact correspondence between the fifth-dimensional coordinate of\nAdS space $z$ and a specific impact variable $\\zeta$ which measures the\nseparation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron in ordinary\nspace-time.

The starting point is a\nkinetic model for low-density granular mixtures recently proposed by the\nauthors [Vega Reyes F et al. 2007 Phys. Rev. E 75 061306]. Two routes have been\nconsidered. First, a hydrodynamic or normal solution is found by exploiting a\nformal mapping between the kinetic equations for the gas particles and for the\nimpurity. We show that the transport properties of the impurity are\ncharacterized by the ratio between the temperatures of the impurity and gas\nparticles and by five generalized transport coefficients: three related to the\nmomentum flux (a nonlinear shear viscosity and two normal stress differences)\nand two related to the heat flux (a nonlinear thermal conductivity and a cross\ncoefficient measuring a component of the heat flux orthogonal to the thermal\ngradient). Second, by means of a Monte Carlo simulation method we numerically\nsolve the kinetic equations and show that our hydrodynamic solution is valid in\nthe bulk of the fluid when realistic boundary conditions are used. Furthermore,\nthe hydrodynamic solution applies to arbitrarily (inside the continuum regime)\nlarge values of the shear rate, of the inelasticity, and of the rest of\nparameters of the system. Preliminary simulation results of the true Boltzmann\ndescription show the reliability of the nonlinear hydrodynamic solution of the\nkinetic model. This shows again the validity of a hydrodynamic description for\ngranular flows, even under extreme conditions, beyond the Navier-Stokes domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2008 22:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 14:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-05"}

In this paper, we focus on the broad-line composite galaxies\n(composite AGNs) which are located between the theoretical and empirical\nseparation lines in the [NII]/Ha vs. [OIII]/Hb diagram. These galaxies are\nsearched for from the composite galaxies provided by the SDSS DR4 MPA/JHU\ncatalogs.

For these experiments, atmospheric\nmuons from primary cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere play an important\nrole, because they provide the most abundant source of events for calibration\nand test. On the other side, they represent the major background source.\n  In this paper a fast Monte Carlo generator (called MUPAGE) of bundles of\natmospheric muons for underwater/ice neutrino telescopes is presented. MUPAGE\nis based on parametric formulas [APP25(2006)1] obtained from a full Monte Carlo\nsimulation of cosmic ray showers generating muons in bundle, which are\npropagated down to 5 km w.e.

The multiplicity of\nthe muons in the bundle, the muon spatial distribution and energy spectrum are\nsimulated according to a specific model of primary cosmic ray flux, with\nconstraints from measurements of the muon flux with underground experiments.

Considering a particular (though simple)\nregression problem, we prove that VFCV with a bounded V is suboptimal for model\nselection, because it ``overpenalizes'' all the more that V is large. Hence,\nasymptotic optimality requires V to go to infinity. However, when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio is low, it appears that overpenalizing is necessary, so\nthat the optimal V is not always the larger one, despite of the variability\nissue. This is confirmed by some simulated data. In order to improve on the\nprediction performance of VFCV, we define a new model selection procedure,\ncalled ``V-fold penalization'' (penVF). It is a V-fold subsampling version of\nEfron's bootstrap penalties, so that it has the same computational cost as\nVFCV, while being more flexible. In a heteroscedastic regression framework,\nassuming the models to have a particular structure, we prove that penVF\nsatisfies a non-asymptotic oracle inequality with a leading constant that tends\nto 1 when the sample size goes to infinity. In particular, this implies\nadaptivity to the smoothness of the regression function, even with a highly\nheteroscedastic noise. Moreover, it is easy to overpenalize with penVF,\nindependently from the V parameter.

In this case, the filamentation\ninstability growth rate can reach a maximum value markedly larger than that for\na a plasma with a Maxwellian distribution function. This behaviour is opposite\nto what was observed for the Weibel instability growth rate in a bi-kappa\nplasma, which is always smaller than that obtained for a bi-Maxwellian plasma.\nThe approach is further generalized for a counterstreaming plasma with a\nbi-kappa temperature anisotropy.

Here we show that, in\nfact, this new analysis is consistent with the one of Vidal-Madjar et al.\n(2003, VM003) and supports the detection of evaporation. The apparent\ndisagreement is mainly due to the disparate wavelength ranges that are used to\nderive the transit absorption depth. VM003 derives a (15+/-4)% absorption depth\nduring transit over the core of the stellar Lyman-alpha line (from -130 km/s to\n+100 km/s), and this result agrees with the (8.9+/-2.1)% absorption depth\nreported by BJ007 from a slightly expanded dataset but over a larger wavelength\nrange (+/-200 km/s). These measurements agree also with the (5+/-2)% absorption\nreported by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2004) over the whole Lyman-alpha line from\nindependent, lower-resolution data. We show that stellar Lyman-alpha\nvariability is unlikely to significantly affect those detections.

In contrast with the low SiO abundances (<10E-12) in the ambient\ngas, the narrow SiO emission at almost ambient velocities reveals enhanced SiO\nabundances of 10E-11. This enhancement has been proposed to be produced by the\nsputtering of the grain mantles at the first stages of C-shocks. However,\nmodelling of the sputtering of grains has usually averaged the SiO abundances\nover the dissipation region of C-shocks, which cannot explain the recent\nobservations. Aims: To model the evolution of the gas phase abundances of SiO,\nCH3OH and H2O, produced by the sputtering of grains as the shock propagates\nthrough the ambient gas. Methods: We propose a parametric model to describe the\nphysical structure of C-shocks as a function of time. Using the known\nsputtering yields for water mantles (with minor constituents like silicon and\nCH3OH) and olivine cores by collisions with H2, He, C, O, Si, Fe and CO, we\nfollow the evolution of the abundances of silicon, CH3OH and H2O ejected from\ngrains. Results: The evolution of these abundances shows that CO seems to be\nthe most efficient sputtering agent in low velocity shocks. The velocity\nthreshold for the sputtering of silicon from the grain mantles is reduced by\n5-10 km s-1 by CO compared to other models. The sputtering by CO can generate\nSiO abundances of 10E-11 at the early stages of low velocity shocks, consistent\nwith those observed in the magnetic precursor of L1448-mm. Our model also\nsatisfactorily reproduce the progressive enhancement of SiO, CH3OH and H2O\nobserved in this outflow by the coexistence of two shocks with vs=30 and\n60kms-1 within the same region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2008 11:43:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We\nbegin with several derivations of the abelian anomaly: anomalous transformation\nof the measure, explicit computation of the triangle Feynman diagram, relation\nto the index of the Euclidean Dirac operator. The chiral (non-abelian) gauge\nanomaly is derived by evaluating the anomalous triangle diagram with three\nnon-abelian gauge fields coupled to a chiral fermion. We discuss in detail the\nrelation between anomaly, current non-conservation and non-invariance of the\neffective action, with special emphasis on the derivation of the anomalous\nSlavnov-Taylor/Ward identities. We show why anomalies always are finite and\nlocal. A general characterization is given of gauge groups and fermion\nrepresentations which may lead to anomalies in four dimensions, and the issue\nof anomaly cancellation is discussed, in particular the classical example of\nthe standard model.\n  Then, we move to more formal developments and arbitrary even dimensions.\nAfter introducing a few basic notions of differential geometry, in particular\ncharacteristic classes, we derive the descent equations. We prove the\nWess-Zumino consistency condition and show that relevant anomalies correspond\nto BRST cohomologies at ghost number one. We discuss why and how anomalies are\nrelated to characteristic classes in two more dimensions and outline their\ncomputation in terms of the index of an appropriate Dirac operator. Finally we\nderive the gauge and gravitational anomalies in arbitrary even dimensions from\nthe appropriate index and explain the anomaly cancellations in ten-dimensional\nIIB supergravity and in type I and heterotic superstrings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2008 15:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-06"}

The (bbar b u sbar)\ntetraquark can appear in the observed decays Upsilon(5S) --> Upsilon(1S) K^+\nK^- as a peak in the invariant mass of Upsilon(1S) K system. We review the\nmodel showing that these tetraquarks are below the two heavy meson threshold,\nbut respectively above the Upsilon pi pi and Upsilon K Kbar thresholds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2008 15:52:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2008 14:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-04"}
