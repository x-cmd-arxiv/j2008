For example,\ncounting the pth frequency moment has been a very active area of research, in\ntheoretical computer science, databases, and data mining. When p=1, the task\n(i.e., counting the sum) can be accomplished using a simple counter.\n  Compressed Counting (CC) is proposed for efficiently computing the pth\nfrequency moment of a data stream signal A_t, where 0<p<=2. CC is applicable if\nthe streaming data follow the Turnstile model, with the restriction that at the\ntime t for the evaluation, A_t[i]>= 0, which includes the strict Turnstile\nmodel as a special case. For natural data streams encountered in practice, this\nrestriction is minor.\n  The underly technique for CC is what we call skewed stable random\nprojections, which captures the intuition that, when p=1 a simple counter\nsuffices, and when p = 1+/\\Delta with small \\Delta, the sample complexity of a\ncounter system should be low (continuously as a function of \\Delta). We show at\nsmall \\Delta the sample complexity (number of projections) k = O(1/\\epsilon)\ninstead of O(1/\\epsilon^2).\n  Compressed Counting can serve a basic building block for other tasks in\nstatistics and computing, for example, estimation entropies of data streams,\nparameter estimations using the method of moments and maximum likelihood.\n  Finally, another contribution is an algorithm for approximating the\nlogarithmic norm, \\sum_{i=1}^D\\log A_t[i], and logarithmic distance.

We point out that, within the conventional PNJL model\nat finite density the color neutrality is missing because the Wilson line\nserves as an external ``colored'' field coupled to dynamical quarks. In this\npaper we heuristically assume that the model may still be applicable. To get\ncolor neutrality one has then to allow non vanishing color chemical potentials.\nWe study how the quark matter phase diagram in $(T,m_s^2/\\mu)$-plane is\naffected by imposing neutrality and by including the Polyakov loop dynamics.\nAlthough these two effects are correlated in a nonlinear way, the impact of the\nPolyakov loop turns out to be significant in the $T$ direction, while imposing\nneutrality brings a remarkable effect in the $m_s^2/\\mu$ direction. In\nparticular, we find a novel unlocking transition, when the temperature is\nincreased, even in the chiral SU(3) limit. We clarify how and why this is\npossible once the dynamics of the colored Polyakov loop is taken into account.\nAlso we succeed in giving an analytic expression for $T_c$ for the transition\nfrom two-flavor pairing (2SC) to unpaired quark matter in the presence of the\nPolyakov loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2008 20:36:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2008 19:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nadopted model is that of Fritz et al., 2006. The fit is performed by standard\nchi^2 minimisation, the model however can be multi-component comprising a\nstellar and a starburst components, whenever necessary. Models with low\nequatorial optical depth, tau_9.7, were allowed as well as ``traditional''\nmodels with tau_9.7 > 1.0, corresponding to A_V > 22 and the results were\ncompared. Fits using high optical depth tori models only produced dust more\ncompactly distributed than in the configuration where all tau_9.7 models were\npermitted. Tori with decreasing dust density with the distance from the centre\nwere favoured while there was no clear preference for models with or without\nangular variation of the dust density. The computed outer radii of the tori are\nof some tens of parsecs large but can reach, in a few cases, a few hundreds of\nparsecs. The mass of dust, M_Dust, and infrared luminosity, L_IR, integrated in\nthe wavelength range between 1 and 1000 micron, do not show significant\nvariations with redshift, once the observational biases are taken into account.\nObjects with 70 micron detections, representing 25% of the sample, are studied\nseparately and the starburst contribution (whenever present) to the IR\nluminosity can reach, in the most extreme but very few cases, 80%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2008 11:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2008 11:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Incorporating the\nprescription of \\citet{HAC99a} for the accretion efficiency into Eggleton's\nstellar evolution code and assuming that the prescription is valid for\n\\emph{all} metallicities, we performed binary stellar evolution calculations\nfor more than 25,000 close WD binaries with metallicities $Z=0.06, 0.05, 0.04,\n0.03, 0.02, 0.01, 0.004, 0.001, 0.0003$ and 0.0001.

As\na result, the initial parameter spaces for SNe Ia at various $Z$ are presented\nin orbital period-secondary mass ($\\log P_{\\rm i}, M_{\\rm 2}^{\\rm i}$) planes.\nOur study shows that both the initial mass of the secondary and the initial\norbital period increase with metallicity. Thus, the minimum mass of the CO WD\nfor SNe Ia decreases with metallicity $Z$. The difference of the minimum mass\nmay be as large as 0.24 $M_{\\odot}$ for different Z.\n  Adopting the results above, we studied the birth rate of SNe Ia for various\n$Z$ via a binary population synthesis approach. If a single starburst is\nassumed, SNe Ia occur systemically earlier and the peak value of the birth rate\nis larger for a high $Z$. The Galactic birth rate from the WD + MS channel is\nlower than (but comparable to) that inferred from observations.

Reasons for seeking to interpret quantum mechanics are\ndiscussed, then the specific `neo-Everettian' theory is introduced and its\nclaim as the best available interpretation defended. The main objections to the\ninterpretation, including the so-called ``problem of probability'' are shown to\nfail. The local nature of the interpretation is demonstrated, and the\nimplications of this both for the interpretation and for quantum mechanics more\ngenerally are discussed. Finally, the consequences of the theory for quantum\ncomputation are investigated, and common objections to using many worlds to\ndescribe quantum computing are answered.

It is shown\nthat the influence of sort wavelength roughness, which is expressed by the\nroughness exponent H for the case of self-affine roughness, plays significant\nrole in comparison with the effect of the long wavelength roughness parameters\nsuch as the rms roughness amplitude and the lateral roughness correlation\nlength. Therefore, the surface morphology can play important role in designing\nhigh-frequency resonators operating within the non-Newtonian regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2008 15:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
