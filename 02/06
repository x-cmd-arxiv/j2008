The VFL method was first derived in\nthis context by \\cite{AUG84} who discretized Hamilton's action principle with a\nfree-Lagrange data structure. The purpose of this article is to assess the\nlong-time conservation properties of the VFL method for regularized shallow\nwater which are useful for climate simulation. Long-time regularized shallow\nwater simulations show that the VFL method exhibits no secular drift in the (i)\nenergy error through the application of symplectic integrators; and (ii) the\npotential vorticity error through the construction of discrete curl, divergence\nand gradient operators which satisfy semi-discrete divergence and potential\nvorticity conservation laws. These diagnostic semi-discrete equations augment\nthe description of the VFL method by characterizing the evolution of its\nrespective irrotational and solenoidal components in the Lagrangian frame. Like\nthe continuum equations, the former exhibits a $\\text{div}^2\\mathbf{U}$ term\nwhich indicates that the flow has a very strong tendency towards a purely\nrotational state.\n  Numerical results show (i) the preservation of shape and strength of an\ninitially radially symmetric vortex pair in purely rotational regularized\nshallow water and (ii) how the Voronoi diagram retains the history of the flow\nfield and (iii) that energy is conserved to $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta^2)$ and\npotential vorticity error to within 5% with no secular growth over a 50 year\nperiod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2008 20:39:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 03:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-28"}

Because of very frequent\nreconnections the vortex loops (as a whole) do not live long enough to perform\nany essential evolution due to the deterministic motion. On the contrary, they\nrapidly merge and split, and these random recombination processes prevail over\nother slower dynamic processes. To develop quantitative description we take the\nvortex loops to have a Brownian structure with the only degree of freedom,\nwhich is the length $l$ of the loop. We perform investigation on the base of\nthe Boltzmann type kinetic equation for the distribution function $n(l)$ of\nnumber of loops with length $l$. By use of the special ansatz in the collision\nintegral we have found the exact power-like solution to kinetic equation in the\nstationary case. This solution is not (thermodynamically) equilibrium, but on\nthe contrary, it describes the state with two mutual fluxes of the length (or\nenergy) in space of sizes of the vortex loops. The term flux means just\nredistribution of length (or energy) among the loops of different sizes due to\nreconnections. Analyzing this solution we drew several results on the structure\nand dynamics of the vortex tangle in the turbulent superfluid helium. In\nparticular, we evaluated the mean radius of the curvature and the full rate of\nthe reconnection events. We also studied the evolution of the full length of\nvortex loops per unit volume-the so-called vortex line density. It is shown\nthis evolution to obey the famous Vinen equation. The properties of the Vinen\nequation from the point of view of the developed approach had been discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2008 16:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Whereas parity violation in nuclear systems is complicated by the\nintricacies of QCD, measurements of parity violation in the much simpler\nproton-proton system are more straightforward to interpret. We now have three\nsuch precision pp experiments at 13.6, at 45, and 221 MeV. Today there are also\nbetter possibilities for theoretical interpretation using effective field\ntheory. In electron-proton scattering, parity violating ep experiments such as\nSAMPLE, G0, HAPPEX, and PVA4 have already shown that the strange quark\ncontributions to the charge and magnetization distributions of the nucleon are\ntiny. When analyzed together, the results have also greatly improved knowledge\nof the proton's \"weak charge\" (Q^p_weak = 1-4sin^2\\theta_W at tree level). The\nQ^p_weak experiment at JLab will further improve this, determining the proton's\nweak charge to a precision of about 4%. Such a precision will either establish\nconformity with the Standard Model of quarks and leptons or point to New\nPhysics. Following the upgrade of CEBAF at JLab to 12 GeV, a parity violating\nelectron-electron (Moller) scattering experiment similar to SLAC E158, will\nmeasure the weak charge of the electron and hence sin^2\\theta_W at low energy\nwith a precision comparable to the most precise individual measurements at the\nZ0 pole (to about +/- 0.00025). This experiment will be complementary to\nQ^p_weak in terms of sensitivity to New Physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2008 18:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We examine stellar and BH masses (M_star and M_BH) in z~2 active\nsystems at the peak of their AGN or star formation activity to investigate how\nthey are linked and whether AGN radiative or else radio power provides a\nfeedback mechanism that regulates the stellar growth in these systems.\n  Methods.

We find evidence of increasing stellar light, thereby decreasing the\nAGN mid-IR power going from mid-IR selected AGNs, to radio galaxies, and to\nsub-millimeter AGNs. This trend can be explained by either decreasing Eddington\nratios or increasing offsets from the local M_BH-M_star relation. All systems\nare characterized by high star formation rates regardless of their different\nAGN powers, thus neither AGN radiative power nor AGN-driven radio activity\nseems to influence the star formation rate in the selected AGNs.

These so-called\nultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) constitute a transition between classical\nstar clusters and elliptical galaxies in terms of radii, relaxation times and\nV-band mass-to-light (M/L_V) ratios. Using new data, we find that the mass\ninterval from 10^6 to 10^7 M_sun is of special interest, because within this\nrange typical half-light radii and dynamical mass-to-light ratios begin to\nincrease compared to globular clusters, the highest stellar densities are\nreached and typical median two-body relaxation times surpass a Hubble time. The\nM/L_V ratios of the UCDs turn out to be incompatible with the predictions from\nsimple stellar population (SSP) models when using the canonical stellar initial\nmass function (IMF), although SSPs probably are good approximations to the real\nstellar populations in UCDs and the SSP models allow to account for metallicity\neffects on the M/L_V ratio. This provides evidence for the UCDs either having\nformed with an IMF different from the canonical one or containing dark matter.\nWe emphasise that almost all pressure-supported stellar systems ranging from\nstar clusters to massive elliptical galaxies have M/L_V ratios less than 10\nM_sun/L_sun, and that only dSph satellite galaxies have M/L_V ratios greater\nthan 100 M_sun/L_sun and therewith form exceptional systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2008 21:36:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2008 15:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-01"}

Photons that are\ninjected in regions of high optical depth are advected with the flow until they\nescape at the photosphere. Below the photosphere, the photons are coupled to\nthe plasma via Compton scattering. I show here, that as a result of the slight\nmisalignment of the scattering electrons velocity vectors, the (local) comoving\nphoton energy decreases with radius as epsilon'(r) ~ r^{-2/3}. This mechanism\ndominates the photon cooling in scenarios of faster adiabatic cooling of the\nelectrons. I then show that the photospheric radius of a relativistically\nexpanding plasma wind strongly depends on the angle to the line of sight,\ntheta. For theta <~ 1/Gamma, r_{ph} is theta independent, while for theta >~\n1/Gamma, r_{ph} ~ theta^2. I show that the theta dependence of the photosphere\nimplies that for flow parameters characterizing GRBs, thermal photons\noriginating from below the photosphere can be observed up to tens of seconds\nfollowing the inner engine activity decay. I calculate the probability density\nfunction P(r,theta) of a thermal photon to escape the plasma at radius r and\nangle theta. Using this function, I show that following the termination of the\ninternal photon injection mechanism, the thermal flux decreases as F_{BB}^{ob.}\n~ t^{-2}, and that the decay of the photon energy with radius results in a\npower law decay of the observed temperature, T^{ob.}(t) ~ t^{-2/3} at early\ntimes, which changes to t^{-1/2} later. Detailed numerical results are in very\ngood agreement with the analytical predictions.

The main idea of the paper, the\nphysical notion of intrinsic properties, is introduced and many examples\nthereof are given. It replaces the irritating dichotomy of quantum and\nclassical worlds by a much softer difference between intrinsic and extrinsic\nproperties, which concern equally microscopic and macroscopic systems.

Three typical Galactic-disk PNe have been mapped with the\n11.5''x7.2'' Argus array: two dimensional spectral maps of NGC 5882, 6153 and\n7009 with 297 spatial pixels per target were obtained at sub-arcsec resolutions\nand 297 spectra per target were obtained in the 396.4-507.8 nm range. Spatially\nresolved maps of emission lines and of nebular physical properties were\nproduced. The abundances of helium and of doubly ionized carbon and oxygen were\nderived from optical recombination lines (ORLs), while those of O^2+ were also\nderived from the collisionally excited lines (CELs). The abundance discrepancy\nproblem was investigated by mapping the ratio of ORL/CEL abundances for O^2+\n(the abundance discrepancy factor; ADF) across the face of the PNe. The ADF\nvaries between targets and also with position within the targets attaining\nvalues of ~40 in the case of NGC 6153. Correlations of the ADF with geometric\ndistance from the nucleus, as well as with [O III] electron temperature, plasma\nionization state and other physical properties are established. Very small\nvalues of the temperature fluctuation parameter in the plane of the sky are\nfound in all cases. It is argued that these results provide further evidence\nfor the existence in typical PNe of a distinct nebular component consisting of\nhydrogen-deficient plasma.

To this purpose, we exploit a\ngalaxy formation scenario already successfully tested on a wealth of\nobservational data on (proto)spheroids, Lyman break galaxies, Lyman alpha\nemitters, submm galaxies, quasars, and local early-type galaxies. We find that\nthe predicted rate of long GRBs amounts to about 300 events/yr/sr, of which\nabout 30 per cent occur at z>~6. Correspondingly, the GRB number counts well\nagree with the bright SWIFT data, without the need for an intrinsic luminosity\nevolution. Moreover, the above framework enables us to predict properties of\nthe GRB host galaxies. Most GRBs are associated with low mass galaxy halos\nM_H<~10^11 M_sun, and effectively trace the formation of small galaxies in such\nhalos. The hosts are young, with age smaller than 5*10^7 yr, gas rich, but\npoorly extincted (A_V<~0.1) because of their chemical immaturity; this also\nimplies high specific SFR and quite extreme alpha-enhancement. Only the\nminority of hosts residing in large halos with M_H>~10^12 M_sun have larger\nextinction (A_V~0.7-1), SFRs exceeding 100 M_sun/yr and can be detected at\nsubmm wavelengths. Most of the hosts have UV magnitudes in the range -20\n<~M_1350<~ -16, and Lyman alpha luminosity in the range 2*10^40\n<~L_Lya<~2*10^42 erg/s.

Some change in X-ray luminosity by 10^8 orders of magnitude on\ntimescales of days to months due to an increased transfer of mass from the star\ntowards the compact object. Many X-ray binaries are detected at all observable\nfrequencies, from radio to gamma-rays. It has been found that many different\nsources of emission, which peak at different frequencies, are present in X-ray\nbinary spectra and together they produce the observed broadband spectrum.\nHowever, disentangling these components has proved challenging. Much of the\nwork in this thesis concerns disentangling the components that occupy the\noptical and near-infrared (NIR) region of the spectrum of X-ray binaries;\npossibly the region in which the relative contributions of the different\ncomponents are least certain. In particular one component, the synchrotron\nemission from jets of outflowing matter, is found in this work to contribute\nubiquitously to the optical and NIR light of X-ray binaries with relatively\nfaint stars.

This paper provides\nalternative characterizations of this type of inequalities for nonsmooth lower\nsemicontinuous functions defined on a metric or a real Hilbert space. In a\nmetric context, we show that a generalized form of the Lojasiewicz inequality\n(hereby called the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality) relates to metric regularity\nand to the Lipschitz continuity of the sublevel mapping, yielding applications\nto discrete methods (strong convergence of the proximal algorithm). In a\nHilbert setting we further establish that asymptotic properties of the semiflow\ngenerated by $-\\partial f$ are strongly linked to this inequality. This is done\nby introducing the notion of a piecewise subgradient curve: such curves have\nuniformly bounded lengths if and only if the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality is\nsatisfied. Further characterizations in terms of talweg lines -a concept linked\nto the location of the less steepest points at the level sets of $f$- and\nintegrability conditions are given.

For an even number\nof LMO layers, the ground state is shown to have anti-parallel LSMO magnetic\nmoments. This highly resistive, but fragile, state is easily destabilized by\nsmall magnetic fields, which orient the LSMO moments in the direction of the\nfield. The magnetoresistance associated with this transition is very large,\naccording to Monte Carlo and Density Matrix Renormalization Group studies. The\ninfluence of temperature, the case of an odd number of LMO layers, and the\ndifferences between LMO and SrTiO$_3$ as barriers are also addressed. General\ntrends are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2008 15:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
