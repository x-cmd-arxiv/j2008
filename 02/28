Our aim is to understand the radiative processes by investigating the\nobserved emission and its production mechanism using the High Energy\nStereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) experiment. Methods: We report recent\nobservations of the BL Lac source RGB J0152+017 made in late October and\nNovember 2007 with the H.E.S.S. array consisting of four imaging atmospheric\nCherenkov telescopes. Contemporaneous observations were made in X-rays by the\nSwift and RXTE satellites, in the optical band with the ATOM telescope, and in\nthe radio band with the Nancay Radio Telescope. Results: A signal of 173\ngamma-ray photons corresponding to a statistical significance of 6.6 sigma was\nfound in the data. The energy spectrum of the source can be described by a\npowerlaw with a spectral index of 2.95+/-0.36stat+/-0.20syst. The integral flux\nabove 300 GeV corresponds to ~2% of the flux of the Crab nebula. The source\nspectral energy distribution (SED) can be described using a two-component\nnon-thermal synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) leptonic model, except in the\noptical band, which is dominated by a thermal host galaxy component. The\nparameters that are found are very close to those found in similar SSC studies\nin TeV blazars. Conclusions: RGB J0152+017 is discovered as a source of VHE\ngamma-rays by H.E.S.S. The location of its synchrotron peak, as derived from\nthe SED in Swift data, allows clearly classification it as a\nhigh-frequency-peaked BL Lac (HBL).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 17:17:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2008 14:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-09"}

The paper addresses the regime where the noise\nof the mesoscopic conductor initiates activated escape of the Josephson\ndetector out of the zero-voltage state, which can be observed as a voltage\nrise. It is shown that the deviations from Johnson-Nyquist noise can mostly be\naccounted for by an effective temperature which depends on the second noise\ncumulant of the conductor. The deviations from Gaussian statistics lead to\nrather weak effects and essentially only the third cumulant can be measured\nexploiting the dependence of the corrections to the rate of escape from the\nzero-voltage state on the direction of the bias current. These corrections\nvanish as the bias current approaches the critical current. The theory is based\non a description of irreversible processes and fluctuations in terms of state\nvariables and conjugate forces. This approach, going back to work by Onsager\nand Machlup, is extended to account for non-Gaussian noise, and it is shown\nthat the thermodynamically conjugate force to the electric charge plays a role\nsimilar to the counting field introduced in more recent approaches to describe\nnon-Gaussian noise statistics. The theory allows to obtain asymptotically exact\nresults for the rate of escape in the weak noise limit for all values of the\ndamping strength of the Josephson detector. Also the feedback of the detector\non the noise generating conductor is fully taken into account by treating both\ncoupled mesoscopic devices on an equal footing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 16:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-16"}

It is shown that dust aggregates formed out of micron-sized grains\nstick to chondrules, forming a porous dust rim. When chondrules collide, this\ndust can be compacted by means of rolling motions within the porous dust layer.\nThis mechanism dissipates the collisional energy, compacting the rim and\nallowing chondrules to stick. The structure of the obtained chondrule-dust\nagglomerates (referred to as compounds) then consists of three phases:\nchondrules, porous dust, and dust that has been compacted by collisions.\nSubsequently, these compounds accrete their own dust and collide with other\ncompounds. The evolution of the compound size distribution and the relative\nimportance of the phases is calculated by a Monte Carlo code. Growth ends, and\na simulation is terminated when all the dust in the compounds has been\ncompacted. Numerous runs are performed, reflecting the uncertainty in the\nphysical conditions at the chondrule formation time.

However, relative velocities associated with radial drift form\na barrier for further growth. Earlier findings that the dust sweep-up by\nchondrules is proportional to their sizes are confirmed.

Thus we show that, despite the vanishing density of states at\nthe Fermi level in undoped graphene, supercurrents may exist at zero\ntemperature with a natural 1/L^3 dependence at large L. When temperature\neffects are taken into account, the supercurrents are further suppressed beyond\nthe thermal length L_T (~ v_F / k_B T, in terms of the Fermi velocity v_F of\ngraphene), entering a regime where the decay is given by a 1/L^5 dependence.

However, the brightness contrast in the X-ray is only 3:1,\nwhich is consistent with the companion being an X-ray active low-mass\npre-main-sequence star. The companion's X-ray spectrum is relatively hard and\nvariable, as would be expected from a post T Tauri star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 21:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

At least ~20% of the known extrasolar\nplanetary systems are associated with one or more stellar companions. The\norbits of stellar binaries hosting planetary systems are typically wider than\n100 AU and often highly inclined with respect to the planetary orbits. The\neffect of secular perturbations from such an inclined binary orbit on a coupled\nsystem of planets, however, is little understood theoretically. In this paper\nwe investigate various dynamical classes of double-planet systems in binaries\nthrough numerical integrations and we provide an analytic framework based on\nsecular perturbation theories. Differential nodal precession of the planets is\nthe key property that separates two distinct dynamical classes of multiple\nplanets in binaries: (1) dynamically-rigid systems in which the orbital planes\nof planets precess in concert as if they were embedded in a rigid disk, and (2)\nweakly-coupled systems in which the mutual inclination angle between initially\ncoplanar planets grows to large values on secular timescales. In the latter\ncase, the quadrupole perturbation from the outer planet induces additional\nKozai cycles and causes the orbital eccentricity of the inner planet to\noscillate with large amplitudes. The cyclic angular momentum transfer from a\nstellar companion propagating inward through planets can significantly alter\nthe orbital properties of the inner planet on shorter timescales. This\nperturbation propagation mechanism may offer important constraints on the\npresence of additional planets in known single-planet systems in binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 21:15:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 May 2008 19:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The commissioning of a new coronagraph at the Very\nLarge Telescope (VLT) was the occasion to test the performance of this\ntechnique on the well-known object AB Dor A and its 0.09$M_\\odot$ companion AB\nDor C. The purpose of this paper is to refine the photometric analysis on this\nobject and to provide an accurate photometric error budget. In addition to\ncoronagraphy, we calibrated the residual stellar halo with a reference star. We\nused standard techniques for photometric extraction. The companion AB Dor C is\neasily detected at 0.185\" from the primary star, and its magnitudes in H and Ks\nare in agreement with an M5.5 object, as already known from spectroscopic\nobservations. However, these new measurements make the earlier J-band\nphotometry less reliable. Finally, the comparison with evolutionary models\nsupports an age of (75\\pm 25) Myr, contrary to previous analyses. These\nobservations demonstrate that coronagraphic observations can be more efficient\nthan direct imaging, not only to improve contrast, but also to provide a better\nphotometric estimation as long as a good calibration of the stellar halo is\nachieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2008 10:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here, we\nreport the first systematic study of an optically-selected sample of\ntwenty-three active galaxies in atomic hydrogen (HI) gas, which is the most\nsensitive and enduring tracer known of tidal interactions.

In order to make the\nexistence of a mass gap pefrectly clear it is defined as the difference between\nthe regularized full gluon self-energy and its subtracted (also regularized)\ncounterpart. The mass gap is mainly generated by the nonlinear interaction of\nmassless gluon modes. A self-consistent violation of SU(3) color gauge\ninvariance/symmetry is duscussed in order to realize a mass gap in QCD. For\nthis purpose, we propose not to impose the transversality condition on the full\ngluon self-energy, while restoring the transversality of the full gluon\npropagtor relevant for the non-perturbative QCD at the final stage. At the same\ntime, the Slavnov-Taylor identity for the full gluon propagator is always\npreserved. All this allows one to establish the general structure of the full\ngluon propagator in the presence of a mass gap. In this case, two independent\ntypes of formal solutions for the full gluon propagator have been established.\nThe nonlinear iteration solution at which the gluons remain massless is\nexplicitly present. The existence of the solution with an effective gluon mass\nis also demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2008 14:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-05"}

These errors\nare usually modeled on the basis of simple assumptions such as bias, white\nnoise, first order Markov process. In the present work, a formulation of the\nsequential extended Kalman filter is proposed, based on recent findings on the\nuniversal deterministic behavior of model errors in deep contrast with previous\napproaches (Nicolis, 2004). This new scheme is applied in the context of a\nspatially distributed system proposed by Lorenz (1996). It is found that (i)\nfor short times, the estimation error is accurately approximated by an\nevolution law in which the variance of the model error (assumed to be a\ndeterministic process) evolves according to a quadratic law, in agreement with\nthe theory. Moreover, the correlation with the initial condition error appears\nto play a secondary role in the short time dynamics of the estimation error\ncovariance. (ii) The deterministic description of the model error evolution,\nincorporated into the classical extended Kalman filter equations, reveals that\nsubstantial improvements of the filter accuracy can be gained as compared with\nthe classical white noise assumption. The universal, short time, quadratic law\nfor the evolution of the model error covariance matrix seems very promising for\nmodeling estimation error dynamics in sequential data assimilation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2008 15:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In\nthe opposite limit of very strong electron-lattice coupling, instead, the\ncharge ordering transition is signaled by a global enhancement of the optical\nabsorption, with no appreciable spectral weight transfer.
