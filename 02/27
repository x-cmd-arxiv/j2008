Here we report on VSOP observations of\ntwo prominent IDV sources, the BL Lac objects S5 0716+714. To monitor their\nshort term variability, these sources were observed with VSOP at 5 GHz in\nseveral polarisation sensitive experiments, separated in time by one day to six\ndays, in autumn 2000. Contemporaneous flux density measurements with the\nEffelsberg 100m radio telescope were used to directly compare the single dish\nIDV with changes of the VLBI images. A clear IDV behaviour in total intensity\nand linear polarization was observed in 0716+714. Analysis of the VLBI data\nshows that the variations are located inside the VLBI core component of\n0716+714. In good agreement with the single-dish measurements, the VLBI ground\narray images and the VSOP images, both show a decrease in the total flux\ndensity of ~20 mJy and a drop of ~5 mJy in the linear polarization of the VLBI\ncore. No variability was found in the jet. From the variability timescales we\nestimate a source size of a few micro-arcseconds and brightness temperatures\nexceeding 10^15 K. Independent of whether the interpretation of the IDV seen in\nthe VLBI core is source intrinsic or extrinsic a lower limit of T_B > 2x10^12 K\nis obtained by model fitting of the VLBI-core. Our results show that future\nVSOP2 observations should be accompanied by a single dish monitoring not only\nto discriminate between source-extrinsic and source-intrinsic effects but to\nallow also a proper calibration and interpretation of ultra-high resolution\nVSOP2 images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2008 16:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-27"}

According to microscopic\nnuclear theory, spherical shell effects at Z=114, 120, 126 and N=184 provide\nthe extra stability to such SHN to have long enough lifetime to be observed. To\ninvestigate whether the so-called \"stability island\" could really exist around\nthe above Z, N values, the $\\alpha$-decay half lives along with the spontaneous\nfission and $\\beta$-decay half lives of such nuclei are studied. The\n$\\alpha$-decay half lives of SHN with Z=102-120 are calculated in a quantum\ntunneling model with DDM3Y effective nuclear interaction using $Q_\\alpha$\nvalues from three different mass formulae prescribed by Koura, Uno, Tachibana,\nYamada (KUTY), Myers, Swiatecki (MS) and Muntian, Hofmann, Patyk, Sobiczewski\n(MMM). Calculation of spontaneous fission (SF) half lives for the same SHN are\ncarried out using a phenomenological formula and compared with SF half lives\npredicted by Smolanczuk {\\it et al}. Possible source of discrepancy between the\ncalculated $\\alpha$-decay half lives of some nuclei and the experimental data\nof GSI, JINR-FLNR, RIKEN are discussed.

The EXORM is developed for both Keplerian discs\nand perfect-fluid tori where the approximation of oscillations with epicyclic\nfrequencies is acceptable. Clearly, the EXORM could be applied to the\nnear-extreme Kerr black hole systems exhibiting relatively complex QPO\nfrequency patterns. Assuming a Keplerian disc, it can be shown that in the\nframework of the EXORM, all the QPOs observed in the microquasar GRS 1915+105\ncould be explained, while it is not possible in the case of QPOs observed in\nthe Galactic Centre source Sgr A*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2008 17:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-27"}

The high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) in neutron\nstar and stellar-mass black hole X-ray binaries may be the result of a\nresonance between the radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations in strong\ngravity. Aims. In this paper we investigate the resonant coupling between the\nepicyclic modes in a torus in a strong gravitational field. Methods. We perform\nnumerical simulations of axisymmetric constant angular momentum tori in the\npseudo-Newtonian potential. The epicyclic motion is excited by adding a\nconstant radial velocity to the torus. Results. We verify that slender tori\nperform epicyclic motions at the frequencies of free particles, but the\nepicyclic frequencies decrease as the tori grow thicker. More importantly, and\nin contrast to previous numerical studies, we do not find a coupling between\nthe radial and vertical epicyclic motions. The appearance of other modes than\nthe radial epicyclic motion in our simulations is rather due to small numerical\ndeviations from exact equilibrium in the initial state of our torus.\nConclusions. We find that there is no pressure coupling between the two\naxisymmetric epicyclic modes as long as the torus is symmetric with respect to\nthe equatorial plane. However we also find that there are other modes in the\ndisc that may be more attractive for explaining the HF QPOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2008 17:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Terrestrial-based Na I and H I contamination\nare identified which mask the strong exoplanetary absorption signature in the\nNa core, which we find reaches total absorption levels of ~0.11% in a 4.4 Ang\nband. The Na spectral line profile is characterized by a wide absorption\nprofile at the lowest absorption depths, and a sharp transition to a narrow\nabsorption profile at higher absorption values. The transmission spectra also\nshows the presence of an additional absorber at ~6,250 Ang, observed at both\nmedium and low resolutions. We performed various limb-darkening tests,\nincluding using high precision limb-darkening measurements of the sun to\ncharacterize a general trend of Atlas models to slightly overestimate the\namount of limb-darkening at all wavelengths, likely due to the limitations of\nthe model's one-dimensional nature.

It was suggested that pairs of kilo-Hertz\npeaks in the X-ray Fourier power density spectra of some neutron stars reflect\na non-linear resonance between two modes of accretion disk oscillations. In\nseveral specific models, the two modes are related to physically plausible\ncombinations of Keplerian, vertical and radial frequencies of geodesic orbital\nmotion. We investigate this concept for a specific neutron star source, a fixed\npair of modes and various neutron star equations of state. Each neutron star\nmodel is characterized by the equation of state (EOS), rotation frequency\n($\\Omega$) and central energy density ($\\rho_\\mathrm c$). These determine the\nspacetime structure governing geodesic motion and position dependent radial and\nvertical epicyclic oscillations related to the stable circular geodesics. When\nthe parameters of neutron star model are fixed, the two considered modes imply\na frequency-frequency relation which can be compared to the observation in\norder to eliminate the unsatisfactory sets (KR,$\\rho_\\mathrm c, \\Omega$, EOS).\nFor the elimination we use the advanced genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithm\ncomes out from the method of natural selection when subjects with the best\nadaptation to assigned conditions have best chances to survive. The chosen\ngenetic algorithm with sexual reproduction contains one chromosome with\nrestricted lifetime, uniform crossing and genes of type 3/3/5. For encryption\nof physical description (KR,$\\rho_\\mathrm c, \\Omega$, EOS) into chromosome we\nuse the Gray code.

(2) For M>=1E9 Msun\nsystems, the average star formation rate (SFR) of strongly disturbed systems is\nonly modestly enhanced with respect to normal galaxies, in agreement with\nrecent simulations. In fact, over z~0.24 to 0.80, strongly disturbed systems\nonly account for a small fraction (<~30%) of the total SFR density.

We demonstrate a proof\nof concept and show early results of our ongoing three-component bulge-disk-bar\ndecomposition of NIR images for a sample of three complementary samples\nspanning different epochs and different environments (field and cluster). In\ncontrast to most early studies, which only attempt two-component bulge-disk\ndecomposition, we fit three components using GALFIT: a bulge, a disk, and a\nbar.

(1) It is first\napplied to the formation of 10^5 - 10^6 Msun halos which form in the absence of\nany ionizing source. We show, in agreement with previous work, that HD cooling\nis of only marginal importance for most halos; however, we find that for the\nlowest mass halos, HD cooling can equal or surpass the H2 cooling rate. This\nleads to a population of stars formed in halos with effective HD cooling that\nare less massive by a factor of ~6 compared to halos dominated by H2 cooling.\n(2) In the second part of the paper, we ionize the halos in order to explore\nthe impact of HD cooling in the presence of an ample population of free\nelectrons. This leads to cooler temperatures (due to the electron- catalyzed\nproduction of H2) and somewhat lower resulting proto-stellar mass. Adding HD\nchemistry lowers the temperature further, to the level of the CMB. We find that\nHD cooling dominates over H2 cooling in the density range 10^2 cm^-3 to 10^6\ncm^-3, but above this density, the temperature rises and H2 cooling dominates\nagain. Because of this, the accretion rate on to the protostar is almost the\nsame as in the H2 case (at least for accreted masses below 50-100 Msun),\ntherefore we argue that HD cooling in ionized halos will probably not result in\na population of significantly lower mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2008 22:20:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2008 22:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our sample includes many galaxies that are\ndisk-dominated and of late Hubble types. Both color cuts and Sersic cuts yield\na similar sample of ~2000 disk galaxies. We characterize bars and disks by\nellipse-fitting r-band images and applying quantitative criteria. After\nexcluding highly inclined (>60 degrees) systems, we find the following results.\n(1) The optical r-band fraction (f_opt-r) of barred galaxies is ~48%-52%. (2)\nWhen galaxies are separated according to normalized half light radius\n(r_e/R_24), a remarkable result is seen: f_opt-r rises sharply, from ~40% in\ngalaxies that have small r_e/R_24 and visually appear to host prominent bulges,\nto ~70% for galaxies that have large r_e/R_24 and appear disk-dominated. (3)\nf_opt-r rises for galaxies with bluer colors and higher central surface\nbrightness. A weaker rise is seen toward lower masses.

The primary goal of FIGGS is\nto provide a comprehensive and statistically robust characterization of the\nneutral inter-stellar medium properties of faint, gas rich dwarf galaxies. The\nFIGGS galaxies represent the extremely low-mass end of the dwarf irregular\ngalaxies population, with a median M${\\rm{_B\\sim-13.0}}$ and median HI mass of\n$\\sim 3 \\times 10^7$ M$_\\odot$, extending the baseline in mass and luminosity\nspace for a comparative study of galaxy properties.

This paper gives an\nintroduction to FIGGS, describe the GMRT observations and presents the first\nresults from the HI observations. From the FIGGS data we confirm the trend of\nincreasing HI to optical diameter ratio with decreasing optical luminosity; the\nmedian ratio of D$_{\\rm HI}$/D$_{\\rm Ho}$ for the FIGGS sample is 2.4. Further,\non comparing our data with aperture synthesis surveys of bright spirals, we\nfind at best marginal evidence for a decrease in average surface density with\ndecreasing HI mass.

Most\nmethods proposed in the literature address the consensus averaging problem by\ndistributed linear iterative algorithms, with asymptotic convergence of the\nconsensus solution. The convergence rate of such distributed algorithms\ntypically depends on the network topology and the weights given to the edges\nbetween neighboring sensors, as described by the network matrix. In this paper,\nwe propose to accelerate the convergence rate for given network matrices by the\nuse of polynomial filtering algorithms. The main idea of the proposed\nmethodology is to apply a polynomial filter on the network matrix that will\nshape its spectrum in order to increase the convergence rate. Such an algorithm\nis equivalent to periodic updates in each of the sensors by aggregating a few\nof its previous estimates. We formulate the computation of the coefficients of\nthe optimal polynomial as a semi-definite program that can be efficiently and\nglobally solved for both static and dynamic network topologies. We finally\nprovide simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nsolutions in accelerating the convergence of distributed consensus averaging\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 11:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Physical conditions are determined using the Meudon PDR\nmodel of UV illuminated gas. Results. We find that all observational results,\nexcept column densities of CH, CH+ and H2 in its excited (J > 2) levels, are\nconsistent with a cloud model implying a Galactic radiation field (G~0.4 in\nDraine's unit), a density of 80 cm-3 and a temperature (60-80 K) set by the\nequilibrium between heating and cooling processes. To account for excited (J\n>2) H2 levels column densities, an additional component of warm (~ 250K) and\ndense (nH>10^4 cm-3) gas within 0.03 pc of the star would be required. This\nsolution reproduces the observations only if the ortho-to-para H2 ratio at\nformation is 1. In view of the extreme physical conditions and the unsupported\nrequirement on the ortho-to-para ratio, we conclude that H2 excitation is most\nlikely to be accounted for by the presence of warm molecular gas within the\ndiffuse cloud heated by the local dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy.

The various multiverse hypotheses are popular explanations for the\nfine tuning. This paper reviews the four main suggestions on inference in the\npresence of possible multiple universes and observer selection effects. Basic\nidentities from probability theory and previously unnoticed conditional\ndependencies of the propositions involved are used to decide among the\nalternatives. In the case of cosmic fine-tuning, information about the\nobservation is not independent of the hypothesis. It follows that the\nobservation should be used as data when comparing hypotheses. Hence, approaches\nthat use the observation only as background information are incorrect. It is\nalso shown that in some cases the self-sampling assumption by Bostrom leads to\nprobabilities greater than one, leaving the approach inconsistent. The \"some\nuniverse\" (SU) approach is found wanting. Several reasons are given on why the\n\"this universe\" (TU) approach seems to be correct. Lastly, the converse\nselection effect by White is clarified by showing formally that the converse\ncondition leads to SU and its absence to TU. The overall result is that,\nbecause multiverse hypotheses do not predict the fine-tuning for this universe\nany better than a single universe hypothesis, the multiverse hypotheses fail as\nexplanations for cosmic fine-tuning. Conversely, the fine-tuning data does not\nsupport the multiverse hypotheses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 13:18:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2009 19:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-03"}

Winds launched from a rotating\naccretion disk surrounding the black hole are thought to play a critical role,\nallowing the disk to shed angular momentum that would otherwise inhibit\naccretion. Such winds are capable of depositing large amounts of mechanical\nenergy in the host galaxy and its environs, profoundly affecting its formation\nand evolution, and perhaps regulating the formation of large-scale cosmological\nstructures in the early Universe. Although there are good theoretical grounds\nfor believing that outflows from active galactic nuclei originate as disk\nwinds, observational verification has proven elusive. Here we show that\nstructures observed in polarized light across the broad H-alpha emission line\nin the quasar PG 1700+158 originate close to the accretion disk in an electron\nscattering wind. The wind has large rotational motions (~4,000 km/s), providing\ndirect observational evidence that outflows from active galactic nuclei are\nlaunched from the disks. Moreover, the wind rises nearly vertically from the\ndisk, favouring launch mechanisms that impart an initial acceleration\nperpendicular to the disk plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 13:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}

Our model-independent and model-dependent analyses show no evidence of CP\nviolation in these decays. The intermediate amplitudes include well-defined\nflavor states [e.g., rho(770)^+- pi^-+, K*(892)^+- K^-+] and CP-odd eigenstates\n[e.g., rho(770)^0 pi^0, phi(1020) pi^0]. With the null results of the previous\nanalyses for CP-even eigenstates D0/D0bar --> K^+ K^- and D0/D0bar --> pi^+\npi^-, we conclude that any CP violation in the singly Cabibbo-suppressed charm\ndecays occurs at a rate which is not larger than a few percent. These results\nare in accord with the Standard Model predictions, and provide constraints on\nsome models beyond the Standard Model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 15:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2008 22:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-12"}

Rev. E {\\bf 76}, 011706 (2007)] have argued that\nshear strain and tilt of the director relative to the layer normal are coupled\nin smectic elastomers and that the imposition of one necessarily leads to the\ndevelopment of the other. This means, in particular, that a Smectic-A elastomer\nsubjected to a simple shear will develop Smectic-C-like tilt of the director.\nRecently, Kramer and Finkelmann [arXiv:0708.2024, Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 78}, 021704\n(2008)] performed shear experiments on Smectic-A elastomers using two different\nshear geometries. One of the experiments, which implements simple shear,\nproduces clear evidence for the development of Smectic-C-like tilt. Here, we\ngeneralize a model for smectic elastomers introduced by Adams and Warner [Phys.\nRev. E {\\bf 71}, 021708 (2005)] and use it to study the magnitude of\nSmectic-C-like tilt under shear for the two geometries investigated by Kramer\nand Finkelmann. Using reasonable estimates of model parameters, we estimate the\ntilt angle for both geometries, and we compare our estimates to the\nexperimental results. The other shear geometry is problematic since it\nintroduces additional in-plane compressions in a sheet-like sample, thus\ninducing instabilities that we discuss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 15:23:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2008 21:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
