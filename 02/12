When we\ncompare the continuum k-string tensions to the corresponding fundamental string\ntensions, we find that the ratios are close to, but typically 1-2 percent\nabove, the Casimir scaling values favoured by some theoretical approaches.\nFitting the N-dependence in a model-independent way favours an expansion in 1/N\n(as in Casimir scaling) rather than the 1/N^2 that is suggested by naive colour\ncounting. We also observe that the low-lying spectrum of k-string states falls\ninto sectors that belong to particular irreducible representations of SU(N),\ndemonstrating that the dynamics of string binding knows about the full gauge\ngroup and not just about its centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2008 18:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The propagation of the light\nvariations from the Cepheid inside the dusty nebula creates spectacular light\nechoes that can be observed up to large distances from the star itself. This\nphenomenon is currently unique in this class of stars. Aims: For this\nrelatively distant star, the trigonometric parallax available from Hipparcos\nhas a low accuracy. A careful observation of the light echoes has the potential\nto provide a very accurate, geometric distance to RS Pup. Methods: We obtained\na series of CCD images of RS Pup with the NTT/EMMI instrument, covering the\nvariation period of the star (P=41.4d). This allowed us to track the\nprogression of the light wavefronts over the nebular features surrounding the\nstar. We measured precisely the phase lag of the photometric variation in\nseveral regions of the circumstellar nebula. Results: From our phase lag\nmeasurements, we derived a geometric distance of 1992 +/- 28 pc to RS Pup. This\ndistance is affected by a total uncertainty of 1.4%, and corresponds to a\nparallax of pi = 0.502 +/- 0.007 mas and a distance modulus of mu = 11.50 +/-\n0.03. Conclusions: The geometric distance we derived is by far the most\naccurate to a Cepheid, and among the most accurate to any star. RS Pup appears\nboth as somewhat neglected and particularly promising to investigate the\nmass-loss history of Cepheids. Thanks to its highly accurate distance, it is\nalso bound to become an important luminosity fiducial for the long period part\nof the period-luminosity diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2008 18:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-12"}

In this paper, we address that question in detail for a\ngeneral class of systems whose order parameter is describable by a classical\nfield that can vary both in space and time, and whose zero-noise dynamics are\ngoverned by a smooth polynomial potential. We show that a quartic potential\nbarrier can only have second-order transitions, confirming an earlier\nconjecture [1].

Using a time-dependent linear theory\nmodel, we study the evolution of a thin initially eccentric disk under\nconditions appropriate to sub-pc scales in Active Galactic Nuclei. The\nevolution is controlled by a combination of differential precession driven by\nthe disk potential and propagating eccentricity waves that are damped by\nviscosity. A simple estimate yields a circularization timescale of\napproximately 10 Myr at 0.1 pc. Numerical solutions for the eccentricity\nevolution confirm that damping commences on this timescale, but show that the\nsubsequent decay rate of the eccentricity depends upon the uncertain strength\nof viscous damping of eccentricity. If eccentricity waves are important further\ndecay of the eccentricity can be slow, with full circularization requiring up\nto 50 Myr for disks at radii of 0.1 pc to 0.2 pc.

For a <\n0.2 AU, eccentricities are much smaller (most e < 0.2), a characteristic widely\nattributed to damping by tides after the planets formed and the protoplanetary\ngas disk dissipated. We have integrated the classical coupled tidal evolution\nequations for e and a backward in time over the estimated age of each planet,\nand confirmed that the distribution of initial e values of close-in planets\nmatches that of the general population for reasonable tidal dissipation values\nQ, with the best fits for stellar and planetary Q being ~ 10^5.5 and ~ 10^6.5\nrespectively. The current small values of a were only reached gradually due to\ntides over the lifetimes of the planets, i.e., the earlier gas disk migration\ndid not bring all planets to their current orbits. As the orbits tidally\nevolved, there was substantial tidal heating within the planets. The past tidal\nheating of each planet may have contributed significantly to the thermal budget\nthat governed the planet's physical properties, including its radius, which in\nmany cases may be measured by observing transit events. Here we also compute\nthe plausible heating histories for a few planets with anomalously large\nmeasured radii, including HD 209458 b. We show that they may have undergone\nsubstantial tidal heating during the past billion years, perhaps enough to\nexplain their large radii.

For example, it is possible to generate a scalar potential\neither classically or through nonperturbative effects, such as gaugino\ncondensation. Such a potential can stabilize certain of the moduli fields, for\nexample the dilaton. On the other hand, a background of thermal matter with\nmoduli-dependent masses can also stabilize certain of the moduli, e.g., the\nradion. It is important to understand whether these two distinct mechanisms are\ncompatible with each other, that is, that there are no interference terms that\ncould spoil the moduli stabilization. In this paper, we study heterotic string\ntheory on an N=1 orbifold near an enhanced symmetry point. We then consider\nboth a nonperturbatively generated potential and a gas of strings with\nmoduli-dependent masses to stabilize the dilaton and radial modulus,\nrespectively.

The\ndifferential rotation surface shear that tauBoo experiences is found to be 6 to\n10 times larger than that of the Sun.

Finally whereas the variation of the\nmagneto-resistance as a function of the magnetization direction is step-like\nfor an infinite wire, it becomes smooth in the presence of defects or contacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2008 09:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This is achieved by specifying a graph on the\nset of actions, so that the payoff of an agent for selecting a strategy depends\nonly on the number of agents playing each of the neighboring strategies in the\naction graph. We present a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for computing\nmixed Nash equilibria of AGGs with constant treewidth and a constant number of\nagent types (and an arbitrary number of strategies), together with hardness\nresults for the cases when either the treewidth or the number of agent types is\nunconstrained.

The color-magnitude diagram reveals a\nsignificant population of globular clusters in M60, and a large number of young\nluminous clusters in NGC 4647, a small companion spiral galaxy north-west of\nM60. The color distribution of the globular clusters in M60 is clearly bimodal,\nwith a blue peak at (C-T_1)=1.37, and a red peak at (C-T_1)=1.87. We derive two\nnew transformation relations between the (C-T_1)_0 color and [Fe/H] using the\ndata for the globular clusters in our Galaxy and M49. Using these relations we\nderive the metallicity distribution of the globular clusters in M60, which is\nalso bimodal: a dominant metal-poor component with center at [Fe/H]=-1.2, and a\nweaker metal-rich component with center at [Fe/H]=-0.2. The radial number\ndensity profile of the globular clusters is more extended than that of the\nstellar halo, and the radial number density profile of the blue globular\nclusters is more extended than that of the red globular clusters. The number\ndensity maps of the globular clusters show that the spatial distribution of the\nblue globular clusters is roughly circular, while that of the red globular\ncluster is elongated similarly to that of the stellar halo. We estimate the\ntotal number of the globular clusters in M60 to be 3600+/-500$,and the specific\nfrequency to be S_N=3.8+/-0.4. The mean color of the bright blue globular\nclusters gets redder as they get brighter in both the inner and outer region of\nM60. This blue tilt is seen also in the outer region of M49, the brightest\nVirgo galaxy. Implications of these results are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2008 11:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

Interestingly, our analysis reveals that backsplash subhalos\nexist in both the WDM and CDM models. Indeed, there are no statistically\nsignificant differences between the spatial distributions of subhalos in the\nCDM and WDM models. There is evidence that subhalos in the WDM model suffer\nenhanced mass loss relative to their counterparts in the CDM model, reflecting\ntheir lower central densities.

This GRB\ndisplays a soft X-ray emission, a precursor before the onset of the main event,\nand also a soft X-ray tail after the end of the main peak. The light curves in\nfour different energy bands display different features; At higher energy bands\nseveral peaks are seen in the light curve, while at lower energy bands a single\nbroader bump dominates. It is expected that these different features are the\nresult of a mixture of several components each of which has different\nenergetics and variability. To reveal the nature of each component, we analysed\nthe time resolved spectra and they are successfully resolved into several\ncomponents. We also found that these components can be classified into two\ndistinct classes; One is a component which has an exponential decay of $E_{p}$\nwith a characteristic timescale shorter than $\\sim$ 30 sec, and its spectrum is\nwell represented by a broken power law function, which is frequently observed\nin many prompt GRB emissions, so it should have an internal-shock origin.\nAnother is a component whose $E_{p}$ is almost unchanged with characteristic\ntimescale longer than $\\sim$ 60 sec, and shows a very soft emission and slower\nvariability. The spectrum of the soft component is characterized by either a\nbroken power law or a black body spectrum. This component might originate from\na relatively wider and lower velocity jet or a photosphere of the fireball. By\nassuming that the soft component is a thermal emission, the radiation radius is\ninitially $4.4 \\times 10^{6}$ km, which is a typical radius of a blue\nsupergiant, and its expansion velocity is $2.4 \\times 10^{5}$ km/s in the\nsource frame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2008 14:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2008 15:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
