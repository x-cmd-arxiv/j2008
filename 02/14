To aid experimental planning\nand design, we quantify how the precision with which cosmological parameters\ncan be measured depends on a broad range of assumptions. We cover assumptions\nrelated to modeling of the ionization power spectrum and associated\nnonlinearity, experimental specifications like array layout and noise,\ncosmological assumptions about reionization history and inter-galactic medium\n(IGM) evolution, and assumptions about astrophysical foregrounds. We derive\nsimple analytic approximations for how various assumptions affect the results,\nand find that ionization power modeling is most important, followed by array\nlayout (crudely, the more compact, the better). We also present an accurate yet\nrobust method for measuring cosmological parameters in practice, separating the\nphysics from the astrophysics by exploiting both gravitationally induced\nclustering anisotropy and the fact that the ionization power spectra are rather\nsmooth functions that can be accurately fit by 7 phenomenological parameters.\nFor example, a future square kilometer array optimized for 21 cm tomography\ncould improve the sensitivity of the Planck CMB satellite to spatial curvature\nand neutrino masses by up to two orders of magnitude, to Delta-Omega_k ~ 0.0002\nand Delta m_nu ~ 0.007 eV, and give a 4 sigma detection of the spectral index\nrunning predicted by the simpliest inflation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2008 20:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2008 21:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

(By refinement we mean that R'(u)=R'(v)\nimplies R(u)=R(v), and by coarsest refinement we mean that R' is a\ndeterministic function of any other refinement of R in our class of\ntransformations.) We propose a specific embedding that we denote as R^X which\nis particularly amenable for analyzing the occurrence of patterns described by\nregular expressions in X. A toy example of a non-Markovian sequence of 0's and\n1's is analyzed thoroughly: discrete asymptotic distributions are established\nfor the number of occurrences of a certain regular pattern in X_1,...,X_n, as n\ntends to infinity, whereas a Gaussian asymptotic distribution is shown to apply\nfor another regular pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2008 19:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-14"}

We propose that the power of the jet and the SED of its emission are\nlinked to the two main parameters of the accretion process, namely the mass of\nthe black hole and the accretion rate. We assume: i) that the jet kinetic power\nis proportional to the mass accretion rate; ii) that most of the jet\ndissipation takes place at a distance proportional to the black hole mass; iii)\nthat the broad line region exists only above a critical value of the disk\nluminosity, in Eddington units, and iv) that the radius of the broad line\nregion scales as the square root of the ionising disk luminosity. These\nassumptions, motivated by existing observations or by reasonable theoretical\nconsiderations, are sufficient to uniquely determine the SED of all blazars.\nThis framework accounts for the existence of \"blue quasars\", i.e. objects with\nbroad emission lines but with SEDs resembling those of low luminosity high\nenergy peaked BL Lac objects, as well as the existence of relatively low\nluminosity \"red\" quasars. Implications on the possible evolution of blazars are\nbriefly discussed.

In\nthis scenario, non-thermal magnetar spectra in the soft X-rays (i.e. below ~10\nkeV) result from resonant cyclotron scattering of the thermal surface emission\nby hot magnetospheric plasma. We find that this model can successfully account\nfor the soft X-ray emission of magnetars, while using the same number of free\nparameters than the commonly used empirical blackbody plus power-law model.\nHowever, while the RCS model can alone reproduce the soft X-ray spectra of\nAXPs, the much harder spectra of SGRs below ~10 keV, requires the addition of a\npower-law component (the latter being the same component responsible for their\nhard X-ray emission). Although this model in its present form does not explain\nthe hard X-ray emission of a few of these sources, we took this further\ncomponent into account in our modeling not to overlook their contribution in\nthe ~4-10 keV band.

The simplest option for this \"dark\nenergy\" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantum\nvacuum energy. Physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of a\nscalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of general\nrelativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. Although\nthey produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurable\ndifferences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. A\nfingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, which\nintroduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxy\nredshift surveys. Here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of\n0.8. Using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure the\nanisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate of\nstructure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. This is consistent with the\nstandard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,\nalthough the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternative\norigins for the accelerated expansion.

Starting\nwith a very natural setting for strategies available to the advertisers, and\nvia a careful look through the algorithmic lens, we first propose solution\nconcepts for the game originating from the strategic behavior of advertisers as\nthey try to optimize their budget allocation across various keywords. Next, we\nconsider two broad match scenarios based on factors such as information\nasymmetry between advertisers and the auctioneer, and the extent of\nauctioneer's control on the budget splitting. In the first scenario, the\nadvertisers have the full information about broad match and relevant\nparameters, and can reapportion their own budgets to utilize the extra\ninformation; in particular, the auctioneer has no direct control over budget\nsplitting. We show that, the same broad match may lead to different equilibria,\none leading to a revenue improvement, whereas another to a revenue loss. This\nleaves the auctioneer in a dilemma - whether to broad-match or not. This\nmotivates us to consider another broad match scenario, where the advertisers\nhave information only about the current scenario, and the allocation of the\nbudgets unspent in the current scenario is in the control of the auctioneer. We\nobserve that the auctioneer can always improve his revenue by judiciously using\nbroad match.

In particular, the SUMER slit was observing the prominence in a\nsit-and-stare mode.\n  The observations indicate that a siphon flow was moving from the proximity of\nthe prominence to a site at a projected distance of 270$''$, which was followed\nby repetitive H$\\alpha$ surges and continual prominence oscillations. The\noscillation lasted 4 hours before the prominence erupted as a blob-like CME.\nThe analysis of the multiwavelength data indicates that the whole series of\nprocesses fits well into the emerging flux trigger mechanism for CMEs. In this\nmechanism, emerging magnetic flux drives a siphon flow due to increased gas\npressure where the background polarity emerges. It also drives H$\\alpha$ surges\nthrough magnetic reconnection where the opposite polarity emerges. The magnetic\nreconnection triggers the prominence oscillations, as well as its loss of\nequilibrium, which finally leads to the eruption of the prominence.

We consider outermost planets with masses\nranging from 10 earth masses to 1 M_J. We also examine the case of outermost\nbodies with masses < 10 earth masses (M_E). Differential migration of the\nplanets due to disc torques leads to different evolution outcomes depending on\nthe mass of the outer protoplanet. For planets with mass < 3.5 M_E the type II\nmigration rate of the giant exceeds the type I migration rate of the outer\nbody, resulting in divergent migration. Outer bodies with masses in the range\n3.5 < m_o < 20 M_E become trapped at the edge of the gap formed by the giant\nplanet, because of corotation torques. Higher mass planets are captured into\nresonance with the inner planet. If 30 < m_o < 40 M_E or m_o=1 M_J, then the\n2:1 resonance is established. If 80 < m_o < 100 M_E, the 3:2 resonance is\nfavoured.

In\ncomparison with equivalent low-relativistic jets which get surrounded by\ncocoons with vortical backflows filled by mainly toroidal field, the high speed\njets demonstrate only localized, strong toroidal field zones within the\nbackflow vortical structures.

In all cases, the\njet beam contains rich cross-shock patterns, across which part of the kinetic\nenergy gets transferred. For the high speed reference jet considered here,\nsignificant jet deceleration only occurs beyond distances exceeding ${\\cal\nO}(100 R_j)$, as the axial flow can reaccelerate downstream to the internal\ncross-shocks.

We\nshow that a Schwarzschild-AdS black string in the bulk can be consistently\ninterpreted as a quantum-corrected black hole on the brane, but the form of the\nquantum corrections is unlike what we would expect. The stress tensor extracted\nfrom the bulk solution does not have a thermal component corresponding to\nHawking radiation outside the black hole. We compare this strong coupling\nprediction to a weak coupling calculation to study the differences in detail.\nWe comment on implications for asymptotically flat black holes and for black\nholes localised in the extra dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2008 15:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The $\\Sigma$ groups are products\nof a Spin group and an R-symmetry group of a suitable lower dimensional\nsupergravity theory. Using the case of SU(4)-invariant spinors as a paradigm,\nwe demonstrate that the $\\Sigma$ groups, and so the R-symmetry groups of\nlower-dimensional supergravity theories arising from compactifications, have\ndisconnected components. These lead to discrete symmetry groups reminiscent of\nR-parity. We examine the role of disconnected components of the $\\Sigma$ groups\nin the choice of Killing spinor representatives and in the context of\ncompactifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2008 15:59:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 08:39:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}
