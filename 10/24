Since much of\nthe cosmological information comes from scales affected by nonlinear\nclustering, measurements of the lensing power spectrum can be degraded by\nnon-Gaussian covariances. Recently there have been conflicting studies about\nthe level of this degradation. We use the halo model to estimate it and include\nnew contributions related to the finite size of lensing surveys, following\nRimes and Hamilton's study of 3D simulations. We find that non-Gaussian\ncorrelations between different multipoles can degrade the cumulative\nsignal-to-noise for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factor of 2 (or 5\nfor a worst-case model that exceeds current N-body simulation predictions).\nHowever, using an eight-parameter Fisher analysis we find that the marginalized\nerrors on individual parameters are degraded by less than 10% (or 20% for the\nworst-case model). The smaller degradation in parameter accuracy is primarily\nbecause: individual parameters in a high-dimensional parameter space are\ndegraded much less than the volume of the full Fisher ellipsoid; lensing\ninvolves projections along the line of sight, which reduce the non-Gaussian\neffect; some of the cosmological information comes from geometric factors which\nare not degraded at all. We contrast our findings with those of Lee & Pen\n(2008) who suggested a much larger degradation in information content.

Our analysis here is based on our previous 2-D numerical\nMHD simulation study that examines the interplay among wind, field, and\nrotation as a function of two dimensionless parameters, one characterizing the\nwind magnetic confinement ($\\eta_{\\ast} \\equiv B_{eq}^{2} R_{\\ast}^{2}/{\\dot M}\nv_{\\infty}$), and the other the ratio ($W \\equiv V_{rot}/V_{orb}$) of stellar\nrotation to critical (orbital) speed. We compare and contrast the 2-D, time\nvariable angular momentum loss of this dipole model of a hot-star wind with the\nclassical 1-D steady-state analysis by Weber and Davis (WD), who used an\nidealized monopole field to model the angular momentum loss in the solar wind.\nDespite the differences, we find that the total angular momentum loss ${\\dot\nJ}$ averaged over both solid angle and time follows closely the general WD\nscaling ${\\dot J} = (2/3) {\\dot M} \\Omega R_{A}^{2}$, where ${\\dot M}$ is the\nmass loss rate, $\\Omega$ is the stellar angular velocity, and $R_{A}$ is a\ncharacteristic Alfv\\'{e}n radius. However, a key distinction here is that for a\ndipole field, this Alfv\\'{e}n radius has a strong-field scaling $R_{A}/R_{\\ast}\n\\approx \\eta_{\\ast}^{1/4}$, instead of the scaling $R_{A}/R_{\\ast} \\sim\n\\sqrt{\\eta_{\\ast}}$ for a monopole field. This leads to a slower stellar\nspindown time that in the dipole case scales as $\\tau_{spin} = \\tau_{mass}\n1.5k/\\sqrt{\\eta_{\\ast}}$, where $\\tau_{mass} \\equiv M/{\\dot M}$ is the\ncharacteristic mass loss time, and $k$ is the dimensionless factor for stellar\nmoment of inertia.

We simulate a large number of\nSN Ia lines of sight populated by galaxies. For each line of sight the true\nmagnification factor and an estimate thereof are calculated.

This allows us to\nmap mean luminosity-weighted ages, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] in sigma-L-color\nspace.

These behaviors are explained if the\nstar formation histories of the galaxies populate a two-dimensional parameter\nspace. One parameter is the previously well-known increase in age, [Fe/H],\n[Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] with sigma. In addition to this, we find systematic\nvariations at fixed sigma, such that more luminous galaxies are younger, more\nFe-rich, but have lower [Mg/Fe] than their fainter counterparts. The main sigma\ntrends support a paradigm in which more massive galaxies form their stars more\nrapidly and at earlier times than less massive galaxies. The trends at fixed\nsigma are consistent with scatter in the duration of star formation for\ngalaxies at a given sigma. The co-variation of stellar population properties\nand L residuals at fixed sigma that we present here has a number of\nimplications: it explains the differing behavior of stellar population\nindicators when investigated versus sigma as compared to L, and it reveals that\nL is not as efficient as sigma for indicating galaxy \"size\" in stellar\npopulation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2008 20:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In previous works this approach has been\nused to derive upper bounds to fault tolerance thresholds - usually by\nidentifying a privileged resource, such as an entangling gate or a non-Clifford\noperation, and then deriving the noise levels required to make it\n`unprivileged'. In this work we consider extensions of this approach where\nnoise is added to Clifford gates too, and then `commuted' around until it\nconcentrates on attacking the non-Clifford resource. While commuting noise\naround is not always straightforward, we find that easy instances can be\nidentified in popular fault tolerance proposals, thereby enabling sharper upper\nbounds to be derived in these cases. For instance we find that if we take\nKnill's high threshold proposal together with the ability to prepare any\npossible state in the $XY$ plane of the Bloch sphere, then no more than 3.69%\nerror-per-gate noise is sufficient to make it classical, and 13.71% of Knill's\ngamma noise model is sufficient. These bounds have been derived without noise\nbeing added to the decoding parts of the circuits. Introducing such noise in a\ntoy example suggests that the present approach can be optimised further to\nyield tighter bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2008 20:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-12"}

Interband electron-hole generation and recombination processes are\ninefficient due to the non-decaying nature of the relativistic energy spectrum.\nAs a result, a population imbalance of the conduction and valence bands is\ngenerically induced upon the application of a thermal gradient. We show that\nthe thermoelectric response of a graphene monolayer depends upon the ratio of\nthe sample length to an intrinsic length scale l_Q, set by the imbalance\nrelaxation rate. At the same time, we incorporate the crucial influence of the\nmetallic contacts required for the thermopower measurement (under open circuit\nboundary conditions), since carrier exchange with the contacts also relaxes the\nimbalance. These effects are especially pronounced for clean graphene, where\nthe thermoelectric transport is limited exclusively by intercarrier collisions.\nFor specimens shorter than l_Q, the population imbalance extends throughout the\nsample; the TC and TEP asymptote toward their zero imbalance relaxation limits.\nIn the opposite limit of a graphene slab longer than l_Q, at non-zero doping\nthe TC and TEP approach intrinsic values characteristic of the infinite\nimbalance relaxation limit. Samples of intermediate (long) length in the doped\n(undoped) case are predicted to exhibit an inhomogeneous temperature profile,\nwhilst the TC and TEP grow linearly with the system size. In all cases except\nfor the shortest devices, we develop a picture of bulk electron and hole number\ncurrents that flow between thermally conductive leads, where steady-state\nrecombination and generation processes relax the accumulating imbalance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 05:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nsoftening process can also be observed in the later phase of the bursts and its\ncause has also been unknown. Recently, it was suggested that, influenced by the\ncurvature effect, emission from high latitudes would shift the Band function\nspectrum from higher energy band to lower band, and this would give rise to the\nobserved softening process accompanied by a steep decay of the flux density.\nThe curvature effect scenario predicts that the terminating time of the\nsoftening process would be correlated with the duration of the process. In this\npaper, based on the data from the UNLV GRB group web-site, we found an obvious\ncorrelation between the two quantities. In addition, we found that the\nsoftening process can be divided into two classes: the early type softening\n($t_{s,max}\\leq \"4000\"s$) and the late type softening ($t_{s,max} > \"4000\"s$).\nThe two types of softening show different behaviors in the duration vs.\nterminating time plot. In the relation between the variation rates of the flux\ndensity and spectral index during the softening process, a discrepancy between\nthe two types of softening is also observed. According to their time scales and\nthe discrepancy between them, we propose that the two types are of different\norigins: the early type is of internal shock origin and the late type is of\nexternal shock origin. The early softening is referred to the steep decay just\nfollowing the prompt emission, whereas the late decay typically conceives the\ntransition from flat decay to late afterglow decay. We suspect that there might\nbe a great difference of the Lorentz factor in two classes which is responsible\nfor the observed discrepancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 04:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-18"}

The main focus is on the equilibrium properties of a\nsingle component atomic Bose gas, which (at least at rest) forms a\nBose-Einstein condensate. Rotation leads to the formation of quantized vortices\nwhich order into a vortex array, in close analogy with the behaviour of\nsuperfluid helium. Under conditions of rapid rotation, when the vortex density\nbecomes large, atomic Bose gases offer the possibility to explore the physics\nof quantized vortices in novel parameter regimes. First, there is an\ninteresting regime in which the vortices become sufficiently dense that their\ncores -- as set by the healing length -- start to overlap. In this regime, the\ntheoretical description simplifies, allowing a reduction to single particle\nstates in the lowest Landau level. Second, one can envisage entering a regime\nof very high vortex density, when the number of vortices becomes comparable to\nthe number of particles in the gas. In this regime, theory predicts the\nappearance of a series of strongly correlated phases, which can be viewed as\n{\\it bosonic} versions of fractional quantum Hall states. This article\ndescribes the equilibrium properties of rapidly rotating atomic Bose gases in\nboth the mean-field and the strongly correlated regimes, and related\ntheoretical developments for Bose gases in lattices, for multi-component Bose\ngases, and for atomic Fermi gases. The current experimental situation and\noutlook for the future are discussed in the light of these theoretical\ndevelopments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 08:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2009 11:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-26"}

This survey reaches down to I ~ 26 mag. We construct\nthe Initial Mass Function (IMF) from ~ 1.5 Msun well into the brown dwarf\nregime (down to ~ 0.02 Msun). We have detected 30-35 brown dwarf candidates in\nthis sample. The low-mass IMF is combined with a higher-mass IMF constructed\nfrom the groundbased catalogue from Oliveira et al. (2005).

These numerical simulations confirm\nthat synchrotron self-absorption, together with e-e Coulomb collisions,\nconstitute an efficient thermalising mechanism for the coronal electrons.

A preliminary comparison with the Low Hard\nState (LHS) spectrum of Cygnus X-1 indicates a magnetic field below\nequipartition with radiation, suggesting that the corona is not powered through\nmagnetic field dissipation (as assumed in most accretion disc corona models).\nHowever, in the LHS of Cygnus X-1 and other sources, our results also point\ntoward proton temperatures substantially lower than what predicted by the\nADAF-like models.

Specifically the decidability of the logic\nis proved in time 2^O(n) where n is the size of the input formula.\n  Major XML concepts are linearly translated into the logic: XPath navigation\nand node selection semantics, and regular tree languages (which include DTDs\nand XML Schemas). Based on these embeddings, several problems of major\nimportance in XML applications are reduced to satisfiability of the logic.\nThese problems include XPath containment, emptiness, equivalence, overlap,\ncoverage, in the presence or absence of regular tree type constraints, and the\nstatic type-checking of an annotated query.\n  The focus is then given to a sound and complete algorithm for deciding the\nlogic, along with a detailed complexity analysis, and crucial implementation\ntechniques for building an effective solver.

We find that even this simplest dynamical problem -- local stability\nof synchrony -- is non-trivial to solve and requires novel methods for its\nsolution. The dynamics in the vicinity of the synchronous state is determined\nby a multitude of linear operators, in contrast to a single stability matrix in\nconventional linear stability theory. This unusual property qualitatively\ndepends on network topology and may be neglected for globally coupled\nhomogeneous networks. For generic networks, however, the number of operators\nincreases exponentially with the size of the network. We present methods to\ntreat this multi-operator problem exactly. First, based on the Gershgorin and\nPerron-Frobenius theorems, we derive bounds on the eigenvalues that provide\nimportant information about the synchronization process but are not sufficient\nto establish the asymptotic stability or instability of the synchronous state.\nWe then present a complete analysis of asymptotic stability for topologically\nstrongly connected networks using simple graph-theoretical considerations. For\ninhibitory interactions between dissipative (leaky) oscillatory neurons the\nsynchronous state is stable, independent of the parameters and the network\nconnectivity.

The quantum Zeno effect is induced by phonon-assisted exciton relaxation\nbetween the ancillary dot and the charged dots, which is equivalent to a\ncontinuous measurement. We solve analytically the master equation and simulate\nthe dynamics of the system using a realistic set of parameters. In contrast to\nstandard schemes, larger phonon relaxation rates increase the fidelity of the\noperations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 15:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-27"}
