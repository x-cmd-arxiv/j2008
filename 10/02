This definition of a system is anticipated to yield simple,\nexact geometrical insights into the problem of motion in general relativity. It\nbegins by answering the questions what is in motion (a rigid two-dimensional\nsystem boundary), and what motions of this rigid boundary are possible. Nearly\na century ago Herglotz and Noether showed that a three-parameter family of\ntimelike worldlines in Minkowski space satisfying Born's 1909 rigidity\nconditions has only three degrees of freedom instead of the six we are familiar\nwith from Newtonian mechanics.

The mode\nis trapped inside the corotation resonance radius and carries a negative\nenergy. The mode growth arises primarily from wave absorption at the corotation\nresonance, and the sign of the wave absorption depends on the gradient of the\ndisc vortensity. When the mode frequency is sufficiently high, such that the\nslope of the vortensity is positive at corotation positive wave energy is\nabsorbed at the resonance, leading to the growth of mode amplitude. We also\nstudy how the rapid radial inflow at the inner edge of the disc affects the\nmode trapping and growth. Our analysis of the behavior of the fluid\nperturbations in the transonic flow near the ISCO indicates that, while the\ninflow tends to damp the mode, the damping effect is sufficiently small under\nsome conditions so that net mode growth can still be achieved. We further\nclarify the role of the Rossby wave instability and show that it does not\noperate for black hole accretion discs with smooth-varying vortensity profiles.\nOverstable non-axisymmetric p-modes driven by the corotational instability\nprovide a plausible explanation for the high-frequency (> 100 Hz)\nquasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed from a number of black-hole X-ray\nbinaries in the very high state.

Aims: Homogeneous iron abundance measurements for 33 Galactic\nCepheids located in the outer disk together with accurate distance\ndeterminations based on near-infrared photometry are adopted to constrain the\nGalactic iron gradient beyond 10 kpc. Methods: Iron abundances were determined\nusing high resolution Cepheid spectra collected with three different\nobservational instruments: ESPaDOnS@CFHT, Narval@TBL and FEROS@2.2m ESO/MPG\ntelescope. Cepheid distances were estimated using near-infrared (J,H,K-band)\nperiod-luminosity relations and data from SAAO and the 2MASS catalog. Results:\nThe least squares solution over the entire data set indicates that the iron\ngradient in the Galactic disk presents a slope of -0.052+/-0.003 dex/kpc in the\n5-17 kpc range. However, the change of the iron abundance across the disk seems\nto be better described by a linear regime inside the solar circle and a\nflattening of the gradient toward the outer disk (beyond 10 kpc). In the latter\nregion the iron gradient presents a shallower slope, i.e. -0.012+/-0.014\ndex/kpc. In the outer disk (10-12 kpc) we also found that Cepheids present an\nincrease in the spread in iron abundance. Current evidence indicates that the\nspread in metallicity depends on the Galactocentric longitude. Finally, current\ndata do not support the hypothesis of a discontinuity in the iron gradient at\nGalactocentric distances of 10-12 kpc. Conclusions: The occurrence of a spread\nin iron abundance as a function of the Galactocentric longitude indicates that\nlinear radial gradients should be cautiously treated to constrain the chemical\nevolution across the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 16:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Recently it was discovered that the orbital 3-velocity of\nKeplerian (geodesical) discs orbiting Kerr black holes with the spin a>0.9953,\nbeing analyzed in the locally non-rotating frames, reveals a hump near the\nmarginally stable orbit. Further it was suggested that the hump could excite\nthe epicyclic motion of particles near the ISCO with frequencies typical for\nhigh-frequency QPOs. Characteristic frequency of the hump-induced oscillations\nwas defined as the maximal positive rate of change of the LNRF-related orbital\nvelocity with the proper radial distance.

The\ndisc was modeled to have the density and temperature of a minimum mass solar\nnebula, and was driven to a fully-developed turbulence via the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI). We find that the inclusion of standard\ndust to gas ratios does not have any significant effect on the MRI even when\nthe dust sediments to the midplane of the accretion disc. The density\ndistribution of the dust reaches a Gaussian profile, and the scale heights for\nthe dust that we derive are shown to be proportional to the reciprocal of the\nsquare root of the dust radius. The largest dust shows a strong tendency to\nsettle to the midplane of the accretion disc, and tends to organize itself into\nelongated clumps of high density. The dynamics of these clumps is shown to be\nconsistent with a streaming instability. The streaming instability is seen to\nbe very vigorous and persistent once it forms. Each stream of high density dust\ndisplays a reduced RMS velocity dispersion, and the densest clumpings of large\ndust are shown to form where the streams intersect. We have also shown that the\nmean free path and collision time for the dust that participates in the\nstreaming instability is reduced by almost two orders of magnitude relative to\nthe average mean free paths and collision times.

The quenched distribution is the law of the random walk\nconditioned on a given environment. The annealed distribution is the quenched\nlaw averaged over all environments. The main results of the thesis fall into\ntwo categories: quenched limiting distributions for one-dimensional, transient\nRWRE and annealed large deviations for multidimensional RWRE.\n  The analysis of the quenched distributions for transient, one-dimensional\nRWRE falls into two separate cases. First, when an annealed central limit\ntheorem holds, we prove that a quenched central limit theorem also holds but\nwith a random (depending on the environment) centering. In contrast, when the\nannealed limit distribution is not Gaussian, we prove that there is no quenched\nlimiting distribution for the RWRE. Moreover, we show that for almost every\nenvironment, there exist two random (depending on the environment) sequences of\ntimes, along which random walk has different quenched limiting distributions.\n  While an annealed large deviation principle for multidimensional RWRE was\nknown previously, very little qualitative information was available about the\nannealed large deviation rate function. We prove that if the law on\nenvironments is non-nestling, then the annealed large deviation rate function\nis analytic in a neighborhood of its unique zero (which is the limiting\nvelocity of the RWRE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 19:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-02"}

We estimate our effective SFR\ndetection limit at ~2 x 10^-4 Msun/yr, which is lower than that of GALEX for\nregions of this size. As expected, the HII regions contain massive main\nsequence stars (in the mass range 18-27 Msun, based on our best extinction\nestimates), while similar massive main sequence stars are lacking in the\nUV-bright/Halpha-faint regions. The observations are consistent with stellar\nages <10 Myr in the HII regions, and >16 Myr in the UV-bright/Halpha-faint\nregions.

The typical \"steep-flat-steep\" behavior of the\nX-ray light curve can be explained if the same central engine responsible for\nthe main prompt emission continues to be active for a long time, but with a\ndecreasing power. The early X-ray \"afterglow\" emission is then the extension of\nthe prompt emission, originating at approximately the same location, and is not\ndue to forward shocks.

We have gathered a representative sample\nof 88 such galaxies and have provided robust estimates of their gas phase\nmetallicity.

Combining our results with the reported\nevolution of the Tully Fisher relation, we do find that such an evolution\nrequires that ~30% of the stellar mass of local galaxies have been formed\nthrough an external supply of gas, thus excluding the close box model. Distant\nstarbursts & LIRGs have properties (metal abundance, star formation efficiency\n& morphologies) similar to those of local LIRGs. Their underlying physics is\nlikely dominated by gas infall probably through merging or interactions. Our\nstudy further supports the rapid evolution of z~0.4-1 galaxies. Gas exchanges\nbetween galaxies is likely the main cause of this evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2008 09:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Following the work of Seljak &\nWarren (2004), we explore how correct this assumption is and, moving a step\nfurther, we try to qualify the nature of stochasticity. We use Principal\nComponent Analysis applied to the outputs of a cosmological N-body simulation\nto: (1) explore the behaviour of stochasticity in the correlation between\nhaloes of different masses; (2) explore the behaviour of stochasticity in the\ncorrelation between haloes and dark matter. We show results obtained using a\ncatalogue with 2.1 million haloes, from a PMFAST simulation with box size of\n1000h^{-1}Mpc. In the relation between different populations of haloes we find\nthat stochasticity is not-negligible even at large scales.

In the correlation between haloes and dark matter, we\nfind that stochasticity is minimized, as expected, near the dark matter peak (k\n~ 0.02 h Mpc^{-1} for a LambdaCDM cosmology) and, even at large scales, it is\nof the order of 15 per cent above the shot noise. Moreover, we find that the\nreconstruction of the dark matter distribution is improved when we use\neigenvectors as tracers of the bias.

The estimated f(x,v) spans over four\ndecades at any radius. Dark matter particles that end up within two virial\nradii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian\ndistribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes\nincreasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of\nthe Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a\npower-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark\nmatter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in\nthe center of the main halo. The power-law Q(r) profile likely reflects the\ndistribution of entropy (K = sigma^2/rho^{2/3} \\propto r^{1.2}), which dark\nmatter acquires as it is accreted onto a growing halo.

The PNR data also show that the Co layer,\nwhich was deposited on top of the Alq$_3$, adopts a multi-domain magnetic\nstructure at low field and a perfect anti-parallel state is not obtained. The\norigins of the observed MR are discussed and attributed to spin coherent\ntransport. A lower bound for the spin diffusion length in Alq$_3$ was estimated\nas $43 \\pm 5$ nm at 80 K.

We also use a statistical\nthermodynamic approach to constrain the composition of multiple guest\nclathrates formed in the solar nebula. We then infer that krypton and xenon,\nthat are expected to condense in the 20-30 K temperature range in the solar\nnebula, are trapped in clathrates at higher temperatures than 50 K. Once\nformed, these ices either were accreted by Saturn or remained embedded in its\nsurrounding subnebula until they found their way into the regular satellites\ngrowing around Saturn.

The observed deficiencies of Titan's\natmosphere in krypton and xenon could result from other processes that may have\noccurred both prior or after the completion of Titan.

This image provides the highest spatial resolution view of such an object\nto date (16 pc), more than three times better than previous VLBI observations\nof similar objects. The north-west Pictor A hot spot is resolved into a complex\nset of compact components, seen to coincide with the bright part of the hot\nspot imaged at arcsecond-scale resolution with the VLA. In addition to a\ncomparison with VLA data, we compare our VLBA results with data from the HST\nand Chandra telescopes, as well as new Spitzer data. The presence of pc-scale\ncomponents in the hot spot, identifying regions containing strong shocks in the\nfluid flow, leads us to explore the suggestion that they represent sites of\nsynchrotron X-ray production, contributing to the integrated X-ray flux of the\nhot spot, along with X-rays from synchrotron self-Compton scattering.

Hence, correct receiver feedback (in the form of TCP acknowledgements)\nis essential to the goal of sharing the scarce bandwidth resources fairly and\navoiding congestion collapse in the Internet. However, the assumption that a\nTCP receiver can always be trusted (to generate feedback correctly) no longer\nholds as there are plenty of incentives for a receiver to deviate from the\nprotocol. In fact, it has been shown that a misbehaving receiver (whose aim is\nto bring about congestion collapse) can easily generate acknowledgements to\nconceal packet loss, so as to drive a number of honest, innocent senders\narbitrarily fast to create a significant number of non-responsive packet flows,\nleading to denial of service to other Internet users. We give the first formal\ntreatment to this problem. We also give an efficient, provably secure mechanism\nto force a receiver to generate feedback correctly; any incorrect\nacknowledgement will be detected at the sender and cheating TCP receivers would\nbe identified. The idea is as follows: for each packet sent, the sender\ngenerates a tag using a secret key (known to himself only); the receiver could\ngenerate a proof using the packet and the tag alone, and send it to the sender;\nthe sender can then verify the proof using the secret key; an incorrect proof\nwould indicate a cheating receiver.

The absence or relative weakness of\ntypical signs of star formation (like dust features, lines of ionized gas)\nsuggest the presence of large quantities of H2 gas with no (or very little)\nassociated star formation. We use the Stephan's Quintet (SQ) galaxy collision\nto define a physical framework to describe the H2 formation and emission in\ngalaxy-wide shocks. SQ observations show that exceptionally turbulent H2 gas is\ncoexisting with a hot, X-ray emitting plasma. The extreme mid-IR H2 emission\nfrom the shock exceeds that of the X-rays. These observations set a new light\non the contribution of H2 to the cooling of the interstellar medium, on the\nrelation between molecular gas and star formation, and on the energetics of\ngalaxy formation.\n  These observations can be interpreted by considering that the shock is moving\nthrough an inhomogeneous medium. They suggest that most of the shock energy is\ntransferred to bulk kinetic energy of the H2 gas. The turbulent energy of the\npost-shock gas drives a mass cycle across the different gas phases where H2 is\nforming out of the hot/warm gas. This interpretation puts the H2 emission into\na broader context including optical and X-ray observations. We propose that the\nturbulence in the clouds is powered by a slow energy and momentum transfer from\nthe bulk motion of the gas and that the dissipation of this turbulent energy in\nturn is powering the H2 emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2008 07:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-03"}

Pimenov introduced a new geometry --\nsemi-Riemannian one -- as a set of geometrical objects consistent with a\nfibering $ pr: M_n \\to M_m.$ He suggested the heuristic principle according to\nwhich the physically different quantities (meter, second, coulomb etc.) are\ngeometrically modelled as space coordinates that are not superposed by\nautomorphisms. As there is only one type of coordinates in Riemannian geometry\nand only three types of coordinates in pseudo-Riemannian one, a multiple\nfibered semi-Riemannian geometry is the most appropriate one for the treatment\nof more then three different physical quantities as unified geometrical field\ntheory.\n  Semi-Euclidean geometry $^{3}R_5^4$ with 1-dimensional fiber $x^5$ and\n4-dimensional Minkowski space-time as a base is naturally interpreted as\nclassical electrodynamics. Semi-Riemannian geometry $^{3}V_5^4$ with the\ngeneral relativity pseudo-Riemannian space-time $^{3}V^4,$ and 1-dimensional\nfiber $x^5,$ responsible for the electromagnetism, provides the unified field\ntheory of gravitation and electromagnetism. Unlike Kaluza-Klein theories, where\nthe 5-th coordinate appears in nondegenerate Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian\ngeometry, the theory based on semi-Riemannian geometry is free from defects of\nthe former. In particular, scalar field does not arise.\n  PACS: 04.50.Cd, 02.40.-k, 11.10.Kk\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2008 08:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-23"}

One important characteristic\nis the Fe-As distance (or more abstractly the pnictogen (Pn) height $z$(Pn));\nwe present results for the effect of $z$(Pn) on the electronic structure,\nenergetics, and Fe magnetic moment. We also study LaOFeAs under pressure, and\ninvestigate the effects of both electron and hole doping within the virtual\ncrystal approximation.

First, we carry out a detailed conventional linear stability\nanalysis with respect to perturbations in the form of Fourier modes that\ncorresponds to the convective instability which is not in general\nself-sustained. The helical magnetic field is found to extend the instability\nto a relatively narrow range beyond its purely hydrodynamic limit defined by\nthe Rayleigh line. There is not only a lower critical threshold at which HMRI\nappears but also an upper one at which it disappears again. The latter\ndistinguishes the HMRI from a magnetically-modified Taylor vortex flow. Second,\nwe find an absolute instability threshold as well.

Beyond the Rayleigh\nline the lower threshold of absolute instability rises significantly above the\ncorresponding convective one while the upper one descends significantly below\nits convective counterpart. As a result, the extension of the absolute HMRI\nbeyond the Rayleigh line is considerably shorter than that of the convective\ninstability.

The samples\nconsist of polycrystalline nickel thin films evaporated onto piezoelectric\nactuators. The magnetic properties of these multifunctional hybrids are\ninvestigated at room temperature as a function of the voltage controlled stress\nexerted by the actuator on the Ni film. Ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy\nshows that the magnetic easy axis in the Ni film plane is rotated by 90 degree\nupon changing the polarity of the voltage Vp applied to the actuator. In other\nwords, the in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the Ni film can be inverted\nvia the application of an appropriate voltage Vp. Using SQUID magnetometry, the\nevolution of the magnetization vector is recorded as a function of Vp and of\nthe external magnetic field. Changing Vp allows to reversibly adjust the\nmagnetization orientation in the Ni film plane within a range of approximately\n70 degree. All magnetometry data can be quantitatively understood in terms of\nthe magnetic free energy determined from the ferromagnetic resonance\nexperiments. These results demonstrate that magnetoelastic coupling in hybrid\nstructures indeed is a viable option to control magnetization orientation in\ntechnologically relevant ferromagnetic thin films at room temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2008 11:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-19"}

WIMPs are supposed to interact with baryonic matter via scattering\noff nuclei producing a nuclear recoil with energies up to a few 10 keV with a\nvery low interaction rate of ~10^(-6) events per kg of target material and day\nin the energy region of interest. The Dark Matter experiment CRESST (Cryogenic\nRare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers) and the EURECA project\n(European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array) are aimed at the direct\ndetection of WIMPs with the help of very sensitive modularised cryogenic\ndetectors that basically consist of a transition edge sensor (TES) in\ncombination with a massive absorber crystal. In the CRESST experiment the\nsearch for coherent WIMP-nucleon scattering events is validated by the\ndetection of two processes. In the scintillating absorber single crystal,\nCaWO_4, heat (phonons) and scintillation light are produced and detected with\ntwo independent cryogenic detectors: a phonon channel and a separate light\nchannel. The development of such cryogenic detectors and the potential\nton-scale production are investigated in this paper. To decouple the TES\nproduction from the choice of the target material in order to avoid heating\ncycles of the absorber crystal and to allow pretesting of the TESs, a composite\ndetector design (CDD) for the detector production has been developed and\nstudied. An existing thermal detector model has been extended to the CDD, in\norder to investigate, understand, and optimize the performance of composite\ndetectors. This extended model, which has been worked out in detail, can be\nexpected to provide a considerable help when tailoring composite detectors to\nthe requirements of various experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2008 14:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-03"}

The average electric field in the layer is independent of the voltage\nand is close to the dielectric breakdown field of alkali ion conducting\nglasses. Furthermore, we observe that the thickness of the depletion layer is\nestablished on a much shorter time scale than the resistance. We explain these\nresults by assuming that the huge electric fields created under the anode\nduring Na+ ion depletion lead to a strong increase of the electronic mobility\nin the layer and to charge compensation via extraction of electrons.

However, this invariance requires the\nintroduction of velocity-dependent and acceleration-dependent forces between\nparticles. The textbook treatments of \"relativistic mechanics\" can be\nmisleading; the discussions usually deal with only one particle experiencing\nprescribed forces and so make no mention of these additional velocity- and\nacceleration-dependent forces. A simple example for a situation analogous to a\nparallel-plate capacitor is analyzed for all the conservation laws of Galilean\ninvariance or Lorentz invariance. For this system, Galilean invariance requires\nthat the mechanical momentum is given by pmech=mv but places no restriction on\nthe position-dependent potential function. On the other hand, Lorentz\ninvariance requires that the mechanical momentum is given by\npmech=mv/(1-v^2/c^2)^1/2, and in addition requires that the potential function\nis exactly the Coulomb potential V(|r1-r2|)=k/|r1-r2|. It is also noted that\nthe transmission of the interparticle-force signal at the speed of light again\nsuggests a special role for the Coulomb potential. A nonrelativistic particle\nsystem interacting through the Coulomb potential becomes the Darwin Lagrangian\nwhen extended to a system relativistic through order v^2/c^2, and then allows\nextension to classical electrodynamics as a fully Lorentz-invariant theory of\ninteracting particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2008 14:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-03"}

This can be inferred from the shape of broad relativistic Fe lines seen\nin X-ray spectra of AGN (active galactic nuclei). Several studies have tried to\nmeasure the mean Fe emission properties of AGN at different depths with very\ndifferent results. We compute the mean Fe emission from a large and\nrepresentative sample of AGN X-ray spectra up to redshift ~ 3.5. We developed a\nmethod of computing the rest-frame X-ray average spectrum and applied it to a\nlarge sample (more than 600 objects) of type 1 AGN from two complementary\nmedium sensitivity surveys based on XMM-Newton data, the AXIS and XWAS samples.\nThis method makes use of medium-to-low quality spectra without needing to fit\ncomplex models to the individual spectra but with computing a mean spectrum for\nthe whole sample. Extensive quality tests were performed by comparing real to\nsimulated data, and a significance for the detection of any feature over an\nunderlying continuum was derived. We detect with a 99.9% significance an\nunresolved Fe K-alpha emission line around 6.4 keV with an EW ~ 90 eV, but we\nfind no compelling evidence of any significant broad relativistic emission line\nin the final average spectrum. Deviations from a power law around the narrow\nline are best represented by a reflection component arising from cold or\nlow-ionization material. We estimate an upper limit for the EW of any\nrelativistic line of 400 eV at a 3 sigma confidence level.

In this limit, the Reynolds numbers based on the fluid inertia and on\nthe body inertia are all zero. Previous studies characterized the breakdown of\nthe scallop theorem with fluid inertia. In this paper we show that, even in the\nabsence of fluid inertia, certain dense bodies undergoing reciprocal motion are\nable to swim. Using Lorentz's reciprocal theorem, we first derive the general\ndifferential equations that govern the locomotion kinematics of a dense\nswimmer. We demonstrate that no reciprocal swimming is possible if the body\nmotion consists only of tangential surface deformation (squirming). We then\napply our general formulation to compute the locomotion of four simple\nswimmers, each with a different spatial asymmetry, that perform normal surface\ndeformations.
