Transforming the non-local\nself-energy from a site basis to a molecular orbital basis, we focus on the\ninter-orbital charge transfer between these cluster molecular orbitals in the\nvicinity of the Mott transition. In all cases studied, the charge transfer is\nfound to be small, indicating weak Coulomb induced orbital polarization despite\nsizable level splitting between orbitals. These results demonstrate that all\ncluster molecular orbitals take part in the Mott transition and that the\ninsulating gap opens simultaneously across the entire Fermi surface. Thus, at\nhalf-filling we do not find orbital-selective Mott transitions, nor a\ncombination of band filling and Mott transition in different orbitals.\nNevertheless, the approach towards the transition differs greatly between\ncluster orbitals, giving rise to a pronounced momentum variation along the\nFermi surface, in agreement with previous works. The near absence of Coulomb\ninduced orbital polarization in these clusters differs qualitatively from\nsingle-site multi-orbital studies of several transition metal oxides, where the\nMott phase exhibits nearly complete orbital polarization as a result of a\ncorrelation driven enhancement of the crystal field splitting. The strong\nsingle-particle coupling among cluster orbitals in the single-band case is\nidentified as the source of this difference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2008 16:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Moreover, its duration\n(T_{90} ~ 100s) makes it hardly classifiable as a short GRB. It presents strong\nsimilarities with GRB970228, the prototype of the new class of \"fake\" short\nGRBs that appear to originate from the coalescence of binary neutron stars or\nwhite dwarfs spiraled out into the galactic halo. AIMS: Within the \"canonical\"\nGRB scenario based on the \"fireshell\" model, we test if GRB060614 can be a\n\"fake\" or \"disguised\" short GRB. [...] METHODS: We fit GRB060614 light curves\nin Swift's BAT (15-150keV) and XRT (0.2-10keV) energy bands. Within the\nfireshell model, light curves are formed by two well defined and different\ncomponents: the Proper-GRB (P-GRB), emitted at the fireshell transparency, and\nthe extended afterglow, due to the interaction between the leftover accelerated\nbaryonic and leptonic shell and the CBM. RESULTS: We determine the two free\nparameters describing the GRB source within the fireshell model. [...] A small\naverage CBM density [...] is inferred, typical of galactic halos. The first\nspikelike emission is identified with the P-GRB and the following prolonged\nemission with the extended afterglow peak.[...] CONCLUSIONS: The anomalous\nGRB060614 finds a natural interpretation within our canonical GRB scenario: it\nis a \"disguised\" short GRB. [...] This result points to an old binary system,\nlikely formed by a white dwarf and a neutron star, as the progenitor of\nGRB060614 and well justify the absence of an associated SN Ib/c.

As this can, potentially, be explained with\na modification to General Relativity we look at current cosmological data with\nthe purpose of testing aspects of gravity. Firstly we constrain a\nphenomenological model (mDGP) motivated by a possible extra dimension. This is\ncharacterised by $\\alpha$ which interpolates between (LCDM) and (the Dvali\nGabadadze Porrati (DGP) model). In addition, we analyse general signatures of\nmodified gravity given by the growth parameter $\\gamma$ and power spectrum\nparameter $\\Sigma$. We utilise Weak Lensing data (CFHTLS-wide) in combination\nwith Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) and Supernovae data. We show that\ncurrent weak lensing data is not yet capable of constraining either model in\nisolation. However we demonstrate that this probe is highly beneficial, for in\ncombination with BAOs and Supernovae we obtain $\\alpha < 0.58$ and $\\alpha <\n0.91$ at $1\\sigma$ and $2\\sigma$, respectively. Without the lensing data no\nconstraint is possible. Both analyses disfavour the flat DGP braneworld model\n($\\alpha = 1$) at over $2\\sigma$. We highlight these are insensitive to\npotential systematics in the lensing data. For the growth signature $\\gamma$ we\nshow that, in combination, these probes do not yet have sufficient constraining\npower. Finally, we look beyond these present capabilities and demonstrate that\nEuclid, a future weak lensing survey, will deeply probe the nature of gravity.\nA $1\\sigma$ error of 0.104 is found for $\\alpha$ ($l_{max} = 500$) whereas for\nthe general modified signatures we forecast $1\\sigma$ errors of 0.045 for\n$\\gamma$ and 0.25 for $\\Sigma_{0}$ ($l_{max} = 500$), which is further\ntightened to 0.038 for $\\gamma$ and 0.069 for $\\Sigma_{0}$ ($l_{max} = 10000$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2008 16:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

A one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton origin of the entire SED,\nincluding the VHE gamma-ray emission can be ruled out. The VHE emission could,\nin principle, be interpreted as Compton upscattering of external radiation\n(e.g., from the broad-line regions). However, such an interpretation would\nrequire either an unusually low magnetic field of B ~ 0.03 G or an\nunrealistically high Doppler factor of Gamma ~ 140. In addition, such a model\nfails to reproduce the observed X-ray flux. This as well as the lack of\ncorrelated variability in the optical with the VHE gamma-ray emission and the\nsubstantial gamma-gamma opacity of the BLR radiation field to VHE gamma-rays\nsuggests a multi-zone model. In particular, an SSC model with an emission\nregion far outside the BLR reproduces the simultaneous X-ray -- VHE gamma-ray\nspectrum of 3C279. Alternatively, a hadronic model is capable of reproducing\nthe observed SED of 3C279 reasonably well.

Heavy quark production has been studied by the PHENIX\nexperiment at RHIC via measurements of single leptons from semi-leptonic decays\nin both the electron channel at mid-rapidity and in the muon channel at\nforward-rapidity. Large suppression and azimuthal anisotropy of single\nelectrons have been observed in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV.

In the\nouter disk, the decoupling of the spiral allows the gas to efficiently produce\nnet gas inflow on intermediate scales.

To do so, we\nintroduce the notion of a \"Klazar violator\" vertex in an increasing ordered\ntree and observe that w_{12} counts what we call Klazar trees--increasing\nordered trees with no Klazar violators. A highlight of the paper is a bijection\nfrom n-edge increasing ordered trees to perfect matchings of [2n]={1,2,...,2n}\nthat sends Klazar violators to even numbers matched to a larger odd number. We\nfind the distribution of the latter matches and, in particular, establish the\none-summation explicit formula sum_{k=1}^{lfloor n/2 rfloor}(2k-1)!!^2\nStirlingPartition{n+1}{2k+1} for the number of perfect matchings of [2n] with\nno even-to-larger-odd matches.

We\nfirst consider the possibility of cosmic observers existing at any random time\n(including the future) for constant $\\Lambda$, and take into account the\nsuppression of new structure formation as the universe approaches its eternal\nDeSitter (DS) geometry. Structures that collapse prior to the era of\n$\\Lambda$-domination will lose causal contact with our Hubble volume within a\nfinite (short) conformal time $\\tau_{\\ast}$. Any remnants within our Hubble\nvolume then suffer a cosmological heat death after the universe becomes DS. The\nprobability for finding observers by random measurements in the volume bound by\nthe DeSitter horizon is $P \\simeq 0$, and it is a simple consequence of the\ninformation loss problem for eternal DS spaces resulting from the finite and\nconstant value of its temperature $T_{DS} \\simeq \\Lambda^{-1/2}$ and entropy $S\n= 3/(G\\Lambda)$. By contrast, for geometries with $\\Lambda = 0$, structures can\ncondense and entropy production can continue without bounds at any epoch. The\nprobability of finding observers in $\\Lambda = 0$ geometries is thus\noverwhelming higher than in DS spaces. As a result, anthropic reasoning does\nnot explain the small but nonzero vacuum energy observed in our universe. We\nalso address the case where observers are considered only at a specially chosen\ntime -- like the present epoch -- but relax the allowed values of starting\ndensity fluctuations and hence the redshift of galaxy formation. In this latter\ncase, the bounds on a $\\Lambda$ can be millions of times larger than previous\nestimates -- and the observed value. We thus conclude that anthropic reasoning\nhas limited predictive power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2008 19:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-22"}

Here\nwe point out that for certain smooth 2D potentials with 120 degrees rotational\nsymmetry this problem reduces to the site percolation on a triangular lattice.\nWe use this observation to develop an approximate analytical description of the\ninteger quantum Hall transition. For this purpose we devise a quantum\ngeneralization of the real-space renormalization group (RG) treatment of the\nsite percolation on the triangular lattice. In quantum case, the RG\ntransformation describes the evolution of the distribution of the $3\\times 3$\nscattering matrix at the sites. We find the fixed point of this distribution\nand use it to determine the critical exponent, $\\nu$, for which we find the\nvalue $\\nu \\approx 2.3-2.76$. The RG step involves only a single Hikami box,\nand thus can serve as a minimal RG description of the quantum Hall transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2008 21:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2009 16:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However,\n17th-Century astronomers were uncertain of the long-term variation in the\ninclination of the Earth's axis and were suspicious of Ptolemy's equinox\nobservations. As a result, they produced a wide range of tropical years. Facing\nthis problem, Newton attempted to compute the length of the year on his own,\nusing the ancient equinox observations reported by a famous Greek astronomer\nHipparchus of Rhodes, ten in number. Though Newton had a very thin sample of\ndata, he obtained a tropical year only a few seconds longer than the correct\nlength. The reason lies in Newton's application of a technique similar to\nmodern regression analysis. Newton wrote down the first of the two so-called\n'normal equations' known from the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method. In that\nprocedure, Newton seems to have been the first to employ the mean (average)\nvalue of the data set, while the other leading astronomers of the era (Tycho\nBrahe, Galileo, and Kepler) used the median. Fifty years after Newton, in 1750,\nNewton's method was rediscovered and enhanced by Tobias Mayer. Remarkably, the\nsame regression method served with distinction in the late 1920s when the\nfounding fathers of modern cosmology, Georges Lemaitre (1927), Edwin Hubble\n(1929), and Willem de Sitter (1930), employed it to derive the Hubble constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2008 21:55:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 08:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

This is a deep, 18<g<21.85 (extinction corrected), sample\naimed at probing in detail the faint end of the broad line AGN luminosity\ndistribution at z<2.6. The candidate QSOs were selected from SDSS photometry\nand observed spectroscopically with the 2dF spectrograph on the\nAnglo-Australian Telescope. This sample covers an area of 191.9 deg^2 and\ncontains new spectra of 16326 objects, of which 8764 are QSOs, and 7623 are\nnewly discovered (the remainder were previously identified by the 2QZ and SDSS\nsurveys). The full QSO sample (including objects previously observed in the\nSDSS and 2QZ surveys) contains 12702 QSOs. The new 2SLAQ spectroscopic data set\nalso contains 2343 Galactic stars, including 362 white dwarfs, and 2924 narrow\nemission line galaxies with a median redshift of z=0.22. We present detailed\ncompleteness estimates for the survey, based on modelling of QSO colours,\nincluding host galaxy contributions. This calculation shows that at g~21.85 QSO\ncolours are significantly affected by the presence of a host galaxy up to\nredshift z~1 in the SDSS ugriz bands. In particular we see a significant\nreddening of the objects in g-i towards fainter g-band magnitudes. This\nreddening is consistent with the QSO host galaxies being dominated by a stellar\npopulation of age at least 2-3 Gyr. The full catalogue, including completeness\nestimates, is available on-line at http://www.2slaq.info/\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2008 23:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-10"}

Our model follows\nthe accretion, cooling, star formation and ejection of baryonic mass inside\ngrowing dark matter haloes, with cosmologically motivated specific angular\nmomentum distributions. Models without feedback produce disks that are too\nsmall and rotate too fast. Feedback reduces the baryonic masses of galaxies,\nresulting in larger disks with lower rotation velocities. Models with feedback\ncan reproduce the zero points of the scaling relations between rotation\nvelocity, stellar mass and disk size, but only in the absence of adiabatic\ncontraction. Our feedback mechanism is maximally efficient in expelling mass,\nbut our successful models require 25% of the SN energy, or 100% of the SN\nmomentum, to drive the outflows. It remains to be seen whether such high\nefficiencies are realistic or not. Our energy and momentum driven wind models\nresult in different slopes of various scaling relations, such as size - stellar\nmass, stellar mass - halo mass, and metallicity - stellar mass. Observations\nfavor the energy driven wind at stellar masses below Mstar = 10^{10.5} Msun,\nbut the momentum driven wind model at high masses. The ratio between the\nspecific angular momentum of the baryons to that of the halo, (j_gal/m_gal), is\nnot unity in our models.

Feedback preferentially ejects low angular momentum material\nbecause star formation is more efficient at smaller galactic radii. This\nresults in (j_gal/m_gal) increasing with decreasing halo mass.

Ths information speaks to some of the most fundamental\nquestions in geology about the origin of the Earth, plat e tectonics, the\ngeomagnetic field and even somewhat indirectly to global warming. Measurements\nin multiple locations will strengthen the potential insights. On the particle\nphysics side, we have identified a unique role in the study of anti-neutrinos\nfrom a nuclear power complex, at a range of 55-60 km off shore. Not only can\nprecision measurements be made of most neutrino mixing parameters, including\n$\\theta_{13}$ (depending on magnitude), but the neutrino mass hierarchy can be\ndetermined in a method not heretofore discussed, and one which does not rely\nupon matter effects. This detector is under active study on paper, in the\nlaboratory, and at sea.

In many applications, one\nmight be willing to tolerate more than one false rejection provided the number\nof such cases is controlled, thereby increasing the ability of the procedure to\ndetect false null hypotheses. This suggests replacing control of the FWER by\ncontrolling the probability of $k$ or more false rejections, which is called\nthe $k$-FWER. In this article, a unified approach is presented for deriving the\n$k$-FWER controlling procedures. We first generalize the well-known closure\nprinciple in the context of the FWER to the case of controlling the $k$-FWER.\nThen, we discuss how to derive the $k$-FWER controlling stepwise (stepdown or\nstepup) procedures based on marginal $p$-values using this principle. We show\nthat, under certain conditions, generalized closed testing procedures can be\nreduced to stepwise procedures, and any stepwise procedure is equivalent to a\ngeneralized closed testing procedure. Finally, we generalize the well-known\nHommel procedure in two directions, and show that any generalized Hommel\nprocedure is equivalent to a generalized closed testing procedure with the same\ncritical values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2008 10:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-29"}

We find that at frequencies >\n4500 micro-Hz, the model damping rates appear to be too weak to explain the\nobserved shape of the power spectral density of alpha Cen B. The conclusion\nrests on the assumption that most of the disagreement is due to problems\nmodelling the damping rates, not the excitation rates, of the modes. This\nassumption is supported by a parallel analysis of BiSON Sun-as-a-star data, for\nwhich it is possible to use analysis of very long timeseries to place tight\nconstraints on the assumption. The BiSON analysis shows that there is a similar\nhigh-frequency disagreement between theory and observation in the Sun.\n  We demonstrate that by using suitable comparisons of theory and observation\nit is possible to make inference on the dependence of the p-mode linewidths on\nfrequency, without directly measuring those linewidths, even though the alpha\nCen B dataset is only a few nights long. Use of independent measures from a\nprevious study of the alpha Cen B linewidths in two parts of its spectrum also\nallows us to calibrate our linewidth estimates for the star. The resulting\ncalibrated linewidth curve looks similar to a frequency-scaled version of its\nsolar cousin, with the scaling factor equal to the ratio of the respective\nacoustic cut-off frequencies of the two stars. The ratio of the frequencies at\nwhich the onset of high-frequency problems is seen in both stars is also given\napproximately by the same scaling factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2008 13:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

This is consistent with the suggestion of Jiang et al. that BN may be\ndriving an ionized outflow along that direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2008 15:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

We\nclarify that an unambiguous definition of stability generally requires the\nchoice of additional geometric structure that is not intrinsic to the dynamical\nsystem itself. While global Lyapunov stability is based on the choice of\nseminorms on the vector bundle of perturbations, we propose a definition of\nlocal stability based on the choice of a linear connection. We show how this\ndefinition reproduces known stability criteria for second order dynamical\nsystems. In contrast to the general case, the special geometry of Lagrangian\nsystems provides completely intrinsic notions of global and local stability. We\ndemonstrate that these do not suffer from the limitations occurring in the\nanalysis of the Maupertuis-Jacobi geodesics associated to natural Lagrangian\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2008 15:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-12"}
