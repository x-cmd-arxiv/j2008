Combining an analytic, kinetic model\nwith one-, two-, and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we confirm\nthe existence of this instability in the kinetic regime and determine its\nsaturation mechanisms. In the linear regime, we show that, if the background\nplasma is well magnetized, the CRCD waves grow exponentially at the rates and\nwavelengths predicted by the analytic dispersion relation. The magnetization\ncondition implies that the growth rate of the instability is much smaller than\nthe ion cyclotron frequency. As the instability becomes non-linear, significant\nturbulence forms in the plasma. This turbulence reduces the growth rate of the\nfield and damps the shortest wavelength modes, making the dominant wavelength,\n\\lambda_d, grow proportional to the square of the field. At constant CR\ncurrent, we find that plasma acceleration along the motion of CRs saturates the\ninstability at the magnetic field level such that v_A ~ v_{d,cr}, where v_A is\nthe Alfven velocity in the amplified field, and v_{d,cr} is the drift velocity\nof CRs. The instability can also saturate earlier if CRs get strongly deflected\nby the amplified field, which happens when their Larmor radii get close to\n\\lambda_d. We apply these results to the case of CRs in the upstream medium of\nsupernova remnants. Considering only the most energetic CRs that escape from\nthe shock, we obtain that the field amplification factor of ~10 can be reached.\nThis confirms the CRCD instability as a potentially important component of\nmagnetic amplification process in astrophysical shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Oct 2008 22:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The space\nof geodesic currents on $F$ is a natural companion of Culler-Vogtmann's Outer\nspace $cv(F)$ and studying them together yields new information about both\nspaces as well as about the group $Out(F)$.

The geometric entropy is defined as the\nslowest rate of exponential decay of $\\mu$-measures of bi-infinite cylinders in\n$F$, as the $T$-length of the word defining such a cylinder goes to infinity.\nWe obtain an explicit formula for $h_{T'}(\\mu_T)$, where $T,T'$ are arbitrary\npoints in $cv(F)$ and where $\\mu_T$ denotes a Patterson-Sullivan current\ncorresponding to $T$. It involves the volume entropy $h(T)$ and the extremal\ndistortion of distances in $T$ with respect to distances in $T'$. It follows\nthat, given $T$ in the projectivized outer space $CV(F)$, $h_{T'}(\\mu_T)$ as\nfunction of $T'\\in CV(F)$ achieves a strict global maximum at $T'=T$.

We present BAST (Berlin Automatic\nSearch for Transits), a new algorithm for periodic transit detection, and test\nit on simulated CoRoT data. BAST searches for box-shaped signals in normalized,\nfiltered, variability-fitted, and unfolded light curves. A low-pass filter is\napplied to remove high-frequency signals, and linear fits to subsections of\ndata are subtracted to remove the star's variability. A search for periodicity\nis then performed in transit events identified above a given detection\nthreshold. Some criteria are defined to better separate planet candidates from\nbinary stars.\n  From the analysis of simulated CoRoT light curves, we show that the BAST\ndetection performance is similar to that of the Box-fitting Least-Square (BLS)\nmethod if the signal-to-noise ratio is high. However, the BAST box search for\ntransits computes 10 times faster than the BLS method. By adding periodic\ntransits to simulated CoRoT data, we show that the minimum periodic depth\ndetectable with BAST is a linearly increasing function of the noise level.

A strong\nclustering signal is detected at ~18sigma level, which is the most significant\nmeasurement obtained to date for clustering of X-ray selected AGN. By fitting\nthe projected correlation function w(r_p) with a power law on scales of\nr_p=0.3-40 Mpc/h, we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 8.6\n+- 0.5 Mpc/h and slope of gamma=1.88 +- 0.07 (Poissonian errors; bootstrap\nerrors are about a factor of 2 larger). An excess signal is observed in the\nrange r_p~5-15 Mpc/h, which is due to a large scale structure at z ~ 0.36\ncontaining about 40 AGN. When removing the z ~ 0.36 structure, or computing\nw(r_p) in a narrower range around the peak of the redshift distribution (e.g.\nz=0.4-1.6), the correlation length decreases to r_0 ~ 5-6 Mpc/h, which is\nconsistent with that observed for bright optical QSOs at the same redshift.\n  We investigate the clustering properties of obscured and unobscured AGN\nseparately. Within the statistical uncertainties, we do not find evidence that\nAGN with broad optical lines (BLAGN) cluster differently from AGN without broad\noptical lines (non-BLAGN).\n  The correlation length measured for XMM-COSMOS AGN at z~1 is similar to that\nof massive galaxies (stellar mass M_*> 3 x 10^{10} M_sun) at the same redshift.\nThis suggests that AGN at z~1 are preferentially hosted by massive galaxies, as\nobserved both in the local and in the distant (z~2) Universe.

In general, the presence of a ghost particle, which\nhas negative energy, drives the vacuum to be unstable through pair production\nof ghost particles and ordinary particles. In the case that the vacuum state\npreserves the de Sitter invariance, the number density created by the pair\nproduction inevitably diverges due to unsuppressed ultra-violet(UV)\ncontributions. In such cases one can immediately conclude that the model is not\nviable. However, in the massive gravity theory we cannot construct a vacuum\nstate which respects the de Sitter invariance. Therefore the presence of a\nghost does not immediately mean the breakdown of the model. Explicitly\nestimating the number density and the energy density of particles created by\nthe pair production of two conformal scalar particles and one helicity-0 ghost\ngraviton, we find that these densities both diverge. However, since models with\nhelicity-0 ghost graviton have no de Sitter invariant vacuum state, it is\nrather natural to consider a UV cutoff scale in the three-dimensional momentum\nspace. Then, even if we take the cutoff scale as large as the Planck scale, the\ncreated number density and energy density are well suppressed. In many models\nthe cutoff scale is smaller than the Planck scale. In such models the created\nnumber density and the energy density are negligiblly small as long as only the\nphysics below the cutoff scale is concerned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2008 13:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-28"}

To help interpret the COSMOS data,\nwe have also produced mock COSMOS strong and weak lensing observations, based\non ray-tracing through the Millenium simulation. In agreement with the\nsimulations, we find that strongly lensed images with the largest angular\nseparations are found in the densest regions of the COSMOS field. This is\nexplained by a prevalence among the lens population in dense environments of\nelliptical galaxies with high total-to-stellar mass ratios, which can deflect\nlight through larger angles. However, we also find that the overall fraction of\nelliptical galaxies with strong gravitational lensing is independent of the\nlocal mass density; this observation is not true of the simulations, which\npredict an increasing fraction of strong lenses in dense environments. The\ndiscrepancy may be a real effect, but could also be explained by various\nlimitations of our analysis. For example, our visual search of strong lens\nsystems could be incomplete and suffer from selection bias; the luminosity\nfunction of elliptical galaxies may differ between our real and simulated data;\nor the simplifying assumptions and approximations used in our lensing\nsimulations may be inadequate. Work is therefore ongoing.

We have obtained optical spectroscopy for 44 Sculptor Group GC\ncandidates with the Boller and Chivens (B&C) spectrograph on the Baade\nTelescope at Las Campanas Observatory. There are 2 GCs in NGC 253 and 12\nobjects in NGC 300 with globular-cluster-like spectral features, 9 of which\nhave radial velocities above 0 km/s. The remaining three, due to their radial\nvelocities being below the expected 95% confidence limit for velocities of NGC\n300 halo objects, are flagged as possible foreground stars. The non-clusterlike\ncandidates included 13 stars, 15 galaxies, and an HII region. One GC, four\ngalaxies, two stars, and the HII region from our sample were identified in\narchival Hubble Space Telescope images. For the GCs, we measure spectral\nindices and estimate metallicities using an empirical calibration based on\nMilky Way GCs. The GCs of NGC 300 appear similar to those of the Milky Way.\nExcluding possible stars and including clusters from the literature, the GC\nsystem (GCS) has a velocity dispersion of 68 km/s, and has no clear evidence of\nrotation. The mean metallicity for our full cluster sample plus one literature\nobject is [Fe/H] = -0.94, lying above the relationship between mean GC\nmetallicity and overall galaxy luminosity. Excluding the three low-velocity\ncandidates, we obtain a mean [Fe/H] = -0.98, still higher than expected,\nraising the possibility of significant foreground star contamination even in\nthis sample. Visual confirmation of genuine GCs using high-resolution\nspace-based imagery could greatly reduce the potential problem of interlopers\nin small samples of GCSs in low-radial-velocity galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2008 15:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 01:57:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2009 22:12:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 22:44:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2010 02:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-24"}
