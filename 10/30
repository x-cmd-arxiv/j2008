These post-starburst galaxies lie\nin the redshift range 0.5<z<1.0 with masses >10^9.75Msun. They have a number\ndensity of 1x10^-4 per Mpc^3, almost two orders of magnitude sparser than the\nfull galaxy population with the same mass limit. We compare with simulations to\nshow that the galaxies are consistent with being the descendants of gas rich\nmajor mergers. Starburst mass fractions must be larger than ~5-10% and decay\ntimes shorter than ~10^8 years for post-starburst spectral signatures to be\nobserved in the simulations. We find that the presence of black hole feedback\ndoes not greatly affect the evolution of the simulated merger remnants through\nthe post-starburst phase. The multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of\nthe post-starburst galaxies show that 5/16 have completely ceased the formation\nof new stars. These 5 galaxies correspond to a mass flux entering the\nred-sequence of rhodot(A->Q, PSB) = 0.0038Msun/Mpc^3/yr, assuming the defining\nspectroscopic features are detectable for 0.35Gyr. If the galaxies subsequently\nremain on the red sequence, this accounts for 38(+4/-11)% of the growth rate of\nthe red sequence. Finally, we compare our high redshift results with a sample\nof galaxies with 0.05<z<0.1 observed in the SDSS and UKIDSS surveys. We find a\nvery strong redshift evolution: the mass density of strong post-starburst\ngalaxies is 230 times lower at z~0.07 than at z~0.7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2008 17:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 08:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Several hundred PMS stars are identified and the youth of a subset of\nthese is confirmed by the presence of lithium, H-alpha emission and X-ray\nactivity. We show that the PMS stars are kinematically coherent and spatially\nconcentrated around gamma Vel. The PMS stars have similar proper motions to\ngamma Vel, to main-sequence stars around gammaVel and to early-type stars of\nthe wider Vela OB2 association of which gamma^2 Vel is the brightest member.\nThe ratio of main-sequence stars to low-mass (0.1-0.6 Msun) PMS stars is\nconsistent with a Kroupa mass function. Main-sequence fitting to stars around\ngamma Vel gives a distance modulus of 7.76+/-0.07 mag, consistent with a\nsimilarly-determined distance for Vela OB2 and with interferometric distances\nto gamma^2 Vel. High-mass stellar models indicate an age of 3-4 Myr for gamma^2\nVel, but the low-mass PMS stars have ages of ~10 Myr according to low-mass\nevolutionary models and 5-10 Myr by empirically placing them in an age sequence\nwith other clusters based on colour-magnitude diagrams and lithium depletion.\nWe conclude that the low-mass PMS stars form a genuine association with gamma\nVel and that this is a subcluster within the larger Vela OB2 association. We\nspeculate that gamma^2 Vel formed after the low-mass stars, expelling gas,\nterminating star formation and unbinding the association. The velocity\ndispersion of the PMS stars is too low for this star forming event to have\nproduced all the stars in Vela OB2. Instead, star formation must have started\nat several sites within a molecular cloud, either sequentially or,\nsimultaneously after some triggering event [abridged].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2008 17:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The mixing induces an effective mass term, with an action which\n{\\it preserves} the axion shift symmetry, breaking it spontaneously after the\nbackground selection. With several axions, several 4-forms, and a low string\nscale, as in one of the setups already invoked for dynamically explaining a\ntiny residual vacuum energy in string theory, the 4D mass matrix generated by\nrandom fluxes may have ultralight eigenmodes over the landscape, which are\nquintessence. We illustrate how this works in simplest cases, and outline how\nto get the lightest mass to be comparable to the Hubble scale now, $H_0 \\sim\n10^{-33} {\\rm eV}$. The shift symmetry protects the smallest mass from\nperturbative corrections in field theory. Further, if the ultralight eigenmode\ndoes not couple directly to any sector strongly coupled at a high scale, the\nnon-perturbative field theory corrections to its potential will also be\nsuppressed.

The characteristic\nmass for the instability is 10^7 Msun in gas and 10^5 Msun in stars, and the\nmorphology is the familiar beads on a string with 1-2 kpc separation. Similar\ninstabilities occur in resonance rings and tidal tails. Sequential triggering\nfrom stellar pressure occurs in two ways. For short times and near distances,\nit occurs in the bright rims and dense knots that lag behind during cloud\ndispersal. For long times, it occurs in swept-up shells and along the periphery\nof cleared regions. The first case should be common but difficult to\ndisentangle from independent star formation in the same cloud. The second case\nhas a causality condition and a collapse condition and is often easy to\nrecognize.

This 2-category is a\ncategorification of the Z/2-graded derived category of X; it is also related to\ncategories of matrix factorizations and a categorification of deformation\nquantization (quantization of symmetric monoidal categories). In the appendix\nwe describe a deformation of the B-model and the associated category of branes\nby forms of arbitrary even degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2008 04:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2008 20:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We present new NANTEN2 observations of the TeV gamma ray SNR\nRXJ1713.7-3946 and the W28 region in the 12CO J=2-1, 4-3 and 7-6 emission\nlines. In RXJ1713.7-3946 we confirm that the local molecular gas having\nvelocities around -10 km/s shows remarkably good spatial correlations with the\nSNR. We show that the X ray peaks are well correlated with the molecular gas\nover the whole SNR and suggest that the interactions between the SNR and the\nmolecular gas play an important role in cosmic ray acceleration via several\nways including magnetic field compression. The CO J=4-3 distribution towards\npeak C shows a compact and dense cloud core having a size of about 1 pc as well\nas a broad wing. The core shows a notable anti-correlation with the Suzaku X\nray image and is also associated with hard gamma rays as observed with HESS.\nBased on these findings, we present a picture that peak C is a molecular clump\nsurvived against the impact of the SN blast waves and is surrounded by high\nenergy electrons emitting the X ray. The TeV gamma ray distribution is, on the\nother hand, more extended into the molecular gas, supporting the hadronic\norigin of gamma ray production. W28 is one of the most outstanding star forming\nregions exhibiting TeV gamma rays as identified through a comparison between\nthe NANTEN CO dataset and HESS gamma ray sources. In the W28 region, we show\nthe CO J=2-1 distribution over the whole region as well as the detailed image\nof the two TeV gamma ray peaks. One of them show strong CO J=7-6 emission,\nsuggesting high excitation conditions in this high mass star forming core.

We investigate methods\nto convert spherical potential-density pairs into axisymmetric ones, in which\nthe basic characteristics of the density profile (such as the slope at small\nand large radii) are retained. We achieve this goal by replacing the spherical\nradius r by an oblate radius m in the expression of the gravitational\npotential.\n  We extend and formalize the approach pioneered by Miyamoto & Nagai (1975) to\nbe applicable to arbitrary potential-density pairs. Unfortunately, an\nasymptotic study demonstrates that, at large radii, such models always show a\nR^(-3) disc superposed on a smooth roughly spherical density distribution. As a\nresult, this recipe cannot be used to construct simple flattened\npotential-density pairs for dynamical systems such as dark matter haloes.\nTherefore we apply a modification of our original recipe that cures the problem\nof the discy behaviour. An asymptotic analysis now shows that the density\ndistribution has the desired asymptotic behaviour at large radii (if the\ndensity falls less rapidly than r^(-4)). We also show that the flattening\nprocedure does not alter the shape of the density distribution at small radii:\nwhile the inner density contours are flattened, the slope of the density\nprofile is unaltered.\n  We apply this recipe to construct a set of flattened dark matter haloes based\non the realistic spherical halo models by Dehnen & McLaughlin (2005). This\nexample illustrates that the method works fine for modest flattening values,\nwhereas stronger flattening values lead to peanut-shaped density distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2008 13:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The Boussinesq approximation of the viscous\nlarge shearing box equations is analyzed in which the azimuthal length scale of\nthe disturbance is much larger than the radial and vertical scales. We examine\nthe stability of a non-axisymmetric potential vorticity mode, i.e. a\nPV-anomaly. in a configuration in which buoyant convection and the\nstrato-rotational instability do not to operate. We consider a series of\nboundary conditions which show the PV-anomaly to be unstable both on a finite\nand semi-infinite radial domains. We find these conditions leading to an\ninstability which is the disk analog of Tollmien-Schlichting waves. When the\nviscosity is weak, evidence of the instability is most pronounced by the\nemergence of a vortex sheet at the critical layer located away from the\nboundary where the instability is generated. For some boundary conditions a\nnecessary criterion for the onset of instability for vertical wavelengths that\nare a sizable fraction of the layer's thickness and when the viscosity is small\nis that the appropriate Froude number of the flow be greater than one. This\ninstability persists if more realistic boundary conditions are applied,\nalthough the criterion on the Froude number is more complicated. The unstable\nwaves studied here share qualitative features to the instability seen in\nrotating Blasius boundary layers. The implications of these results are\ndiscussed. An overall new strategy for exploring and interpreting disk\ninstability mechanisms is also suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2008 14:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2008 19:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2008 11:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
