Our technique\nexploits the dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powering active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) in merger-remnant galaxies. Because structure in the\nuniverse is built up through galaxy mergers and nearly all galaxies host a\ncentral SMBH, some galaxies should possess two SMBHs near their centers as the\nresult of a recent merger. These SMBHs spiral to the center of the resultant\nmerger-remnant galaxy, and one or both of the SMBHs may power AGNs. Using the\nDEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we have examined 1881 red galaxies, of which 91\nexhibit [O III] and Hbeta emission lines indicative of Seyfert 2 activity. Of\nthese, 32 AGNs have [O III] emission-line redshifts significantly different\nfrom the redshifts of the host galaxies' stars, corresponding to velocity\noffsets of ~50 km/s to ~300 km/s. Two of these AGNs exhibit double-peaked [O\nIII] emission lines, while the remaining 30 AGNs each exhibit a single set of\nvelocity-offset [O III] emission lines. After exploring a variety of physical\nmodels for these velocity offsets, we argue that the most likely explanation is\ninspiralling SMBHs in merger-remnant galaxies. Based on this interpretation, we\nfind that roughly half of the red galaxies hosting AGNs are also merger\nremnants, which implies that mergers may trigger AGN activity in red galaxies.\nThe AGN velocity offsets we find imply a merger fraction of ~30% and a merger\nrate of ~3 mergers/Gyr for red galaxies at redshifts 0.34 < z < 0.82.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2008 18:06:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2009 22:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Low resolution spectra were obtained at the Nordic Optical\nTelescope and Kitt Peak National Observatory, and photometric observations were\nobtained at MDM and Baker observatories in 2006. We extracted radial velocity\nand equivalent width variations from several Balmer and He I lines in\nindividual spectra. The pulsation frequencies were separated via phase binning\nto detect line-profile variations in Balmer and helium lines, which were\nsubsequently matched to atmospheric models to infer effective temperature and\ngravity changes throughout the pulsation cycle.\n  From the photometry we recovered the four previously observed frequencies and\ndetected a new fifth frequency. From the spectra we directly measured radial\nvelocity and equivalent width variations for the four main frequencies and from\natmospheric models we successfully inferred temperature and gravity changes for\nthese four frequencies.

In accordance with earlier results in the literature, it is first\nshown that the minimum distance of repeat-accumulate codes can grow, at best,\nsublinearly with block length. Then, for repeat-accumulate-accumulate codes and\nrates of 1/3 or less, it is proved that these codes exhibit asymptotically\nlinear distance growth with block length, where the gap to the\nGilbert-Varshamov bound can be made vanishingly small by increasing the number\nof accumulators beyond two.

Exterior calculus is a generalization of vector calculus to smooth\nmanifolds and DEC is one of its discretizations on simplicial complexes such as\ntriangle and tetrahedral meshes. DEC is a coordinate invariant discretization,\nin that it does not depend on the embedding of the simplices or the whole mesh.\nWe start by rewriting the governing equations of Darcy flow using the language\nof exterior calculus. This yields a formulation in terms of flux differential\nform and pressure. The numerical method is then derived by using the framework\nprovided by DEC for discretizing differential forms and operators that act on\nforms. We also develop a discretization for spatially dependent Hodge star that\nvaries with the permeability of the medium. This also allows us to address\ndiscontinuous permeability. The matrix representation for our discrete\nnon-homogeneous Hodge star is diagonal, with positive diagonal entries. The\nresulting linear system of equations for flux and pressure are saddle type,\nwith a diagonal matrix as the top left block. The performance of the proposed\nnumerical method is illustrated on many standard test problems. These include\npatch tests in two and three dimensions, comparison with analytically known\nsolution in two dimensions, layered medium with alternating permeability\nvalues, and a test with a change in permeability along the flow direction. We\nalso show numerical evidence of convergence of the flux and the pressure. A\nconvergence experiment is also included for Darcy flow on a surface. A short\nintroduction to the relevant parts of smooth and discrete exterior calculus is\nincluded in this paper. We also include a discussion of the boundary condition\nin terms of exterior calculus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2008 21:26:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2010 04:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 04:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 19:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-01"}

In combination with the observed quasar luminosity function we\nassess the implications of this clustering for the relationship between quasar\nluminosity and dark matter halo mass. Our analysis allows for non-linearity and\nfinite scatter in the relation between quasar luminosity and halo mass, as well\nas a luminosity dependent quasar lifetime. The additional novel ingredient in\nour modelling is the allowance for an excess in the observed bias over the\nunderlying halo bias owing to the merger driven nature of quasar activity. We\nfind that the observations of clustering and luminosity function can be\nexplained only if both of the following conditions hold: (i) The luminosity to\nhalo mass ratio increases with halo mass; (ii) The observed clustering\namplitude is in excess of that expected solely from halo bias. The latter\nresult is statistically significant at the 99% level. Taken together, the\nobservations provide compelling evidence for merger driven quasar activity,\nwith a black-hole growth that is limited by feedback. In difference from\nprevious analyses, we show that there could be scatter in the luminosity halo\nmass relation of up to 1 dex, and that quasar clustering can not be used to\nestimate the quasar lifetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2008 02:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This computational expense can be prohibitive for even\nmoderate particle number for many physically interesting scenarios, such as\nrecent models of the formation of hot exoplanets, in which the semimajor axis\nof possible progenitors can vary by orders of magnitude. We present new methods\nwhich retain most of the benefits of the standard symplectic integrators but\nallow for radial zones with distinct timesteps. These approaches should make\nsimulations of planetary accretion with large dynamical range tractable. As\nproof of concept we present preliminary science results from an implementation\nof the algorithm as applied to an oligarchic migration scenario for forming hot\nNeptunes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2008 15:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In order to\nget around this problem, we study the flows of several dense emulsions in a\nwide-gap Couette geometry. We couple macroscopic rheometric experiments and\nlocal velocity measurements through MRI techniques. As concentration\nheterogeneities can be expected, we designed a method to measure the local\ndroplet concentration in emulsions with a MRI device. In contrast to dense\nsuspensions of rigid particles where very fast migration occurs under shear, we\nshow that no migration takes place in dense emulsions even for strains as large\nas 100 000 in our systems. As a result of the absence of migration and of\nfinite size effect, we are able to determine very precisely the local\nrheological behavior of several dense emulsions. As the materials are\nhomogeneous, this behavior can also be inferred from purely macroscopic\nmeasurements. We thus suggest that properly analyzed purely macroscopic\nmeasurements in a wide-gap Couette geometry can be used as a tool to study the\nlocal constitutive laws of dense emulsions. All behaviors are basically\nconsistent with Herschel-Bulkley laws of index 0.5, but discrepancies exist at\nthe approach of the yield stress due to slow shear flows below the apparent\nyield stress in the case of a strongly adhesive emulsion.

Using both observed and modelled wave spectra, Uss\nis found to be very well approximated by a simple function of the wind speed\nand significant wave height, generally increasing quadratically with the wind\nspeed. Focusing on a site located 100 km from the mainland, the estimated\ncontribution of Uss to the radar measurement has a magnitude of 0.6 to 1.3% of\nthe wind speed, in the wind direction, a fraction that increases with wind\nspeed. The difference U_E of Lagrangian and Stokes contributions is found to be\nof the order of 0.4 to 0.8% of the wind speed, and 45 to 70 degrees to the\nright of the wind.

The unified\nsequence of blazar spectral energy distribution (SED) is taken into account to\nmake a non-trivial prediction for the EGRB spectrum and more realistic\ncomparison with the data than previous studies. We then try to explain the EGRB\ndata by the two AGN populations: one is blazars, and the other is non-blazar\nAGNs that are responsible for the EGRB in the MeV band. We find that ~80% of\nthe EGRB photon flux at > 100 MeV can be explained by the sum of the two\npopulations, while ~45% can be accounted for only by blazars. The predicted\nEGRB spectrum is in agreement with a wide range of the observed data from X-ray\nto GeV, within the systematic uncertainties in the EGRB determination by EGRET.\nThese results indicate that AGNs including blazars are the primary source of\nEGRB. Blazars are dominant in EGRB at higher energy bands of >100 MeV, while\nnon-blazar AGNs dominate at <100 MeV. Almost all of the EGRB flux from blazars\nwill be resolved into discrete sources by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,\nwhile that from non-blazar AGNs will largely remain unresolved. Therefore,\ncomparison between the integrated source counts and diffuse EGRB flux as a\nfunction of photon energy will give a simple and clear test of our model.\nVarious quantitative predictions for Fermi observations are also made.\nEspecially, our model predicts 600-1200 blazars in all sky down to 2e-9\nphotons/cm^-2/s (>100 MeV), which is considerably smaller than most of previous\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2008 15:14:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2009 06:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}

This allows us to address important questions concerning the solar\ncycle and its effect on solar oscillations, such as: how consistent is the\nacoustic behaviour from one cycle to the next? We have used the p-mode\nfrequencies observed in BiSON data from one solar activity cycle (cycle 22) to\npredict the mode frequencies that were observed in the next activity cycle\n(cycle 23). Some bias in the predicted frequencies was observed when short 108d\ntime series were used to make the predictions. We also found that the accuracy\nof the predictions was dependent on which activity proxy was used to make the\npredictions and on the length of the relevant time series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2008 15:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-21"}

One of the main motivations is the estimation of the chiral\nlow-energy constants at subleading order, that is, keeping full control of the\nrenormalization scale dependence. As an application we show the resonance\nestimation of some coupling, L(10)(mu_0)=(-4.4 \\pm 0.9)10^{-3} and\nC(87)(mu_0)=(3.1 \\pm 1.1)10^{-5}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2008 15:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
