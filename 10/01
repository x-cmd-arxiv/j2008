A non-equilibrium stationary flux\ncan be induced by suitable boundary conditions, and we show indeed that it is\nmesoscopically described by a Fourier equation with a density dependent\ndiffusivity. A simple mean-field description predicts a critical diffusivity if\nthe hopping amplitude vanishes for a certain walker density. Actually, we\nevidence that, even if the density equals this pseudo-critical value, the\nsystem does not present any criticality but only a dynamical slowing down. This\nproperty is confirmed by the fact that, in spite of interaction, the particle\ndistribution at equilibrium is simply described in terms of a product of\nPoissonians. For mesoscopic systems with a stationary flux, a very effect of\ninteraction among particles consists in the amplification of fluctuations,\nwhich is especially relevant close to the pseudo-critical density. This agrees\nwith analogous results obtained for Ising models, clarifying that larger\nfluctuations are induced by the dynamical slowing down and not by a genuine\ncriticality.

This appears to remove any possibility of a meaningful unification\nprediction and is often viewed as a strong argument against direct mediation.\nWe propose two ways that Seiberg duality can circumvent this problem. In the\nfirst, which we call \"deflected-unification\", the SUSY-breaking hidden sector\nis a magnetic theory which undergoes a duality to an electric phase, with fewer\nelementary degrees of freedom coupled to the MSSM. This changes the\nbeta-functions of the MSSM gauge couplings so as to push their Landau poles\nabove the unification scale. We show that this scenario is realised for\nrecently suggested models of gauge mediation based on a metastable SCQD-type\nhidden sector directly coupled to MSSM. The second possibility, which we call\n\"dual-unification\", begins with the observation that, if the mediating fields\nfall into complete SU(5) multiplets, then the MSSM+messengers exhibits a fake\nunification at unphysical values of the gauge couplings. We show that, in known\nexamples of electric/magnetic duals, such a fake unification in the magnetic\ntheory reflects a real unification in the electric theory. We therefore propose\nthat the Standard Model could itself be a magnetic dual of some unknown\nelectric theory in which the true unification takes place. This scenario\nmaintains the unification prediction (and unification scale) even in the\npresence of Landau poles in the magnetic theory below the GUT scale. We further\nnote that this dual realization of grand unification can explain why Nature\nappears to unify, but the proton does not decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2008 17:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Measurements have been typically expressed in terms of the\npositron fraction, which exhibits an increase above 10 GeV. Many scenarios have\nbeen proposed to explain this feature, among them some additional primary\npositrons originating from dark matter annihilation in the Galaxy. The PAMELA\nsatellite has provided high quality data that has enabled high accuracy\nstatistical analyses to be made, showing that the increase in the positron\nfraction extends up to about 100 GeV. It is therefore of paramount importance\nto constrain theoretically the expected secondary positron flux to interpret\nthe observations in an accurate way. We find the secondary positron flux to be\nreproduced well by the available observations, and to have theoretical\nuncertainties that we quantify to be as large as about one order of magnitude.\nWe also discuss the positron fraction issue and find that our predictions may\nbe consistent with the data taken before PAMELA. For PAMELA data, we find that\nan excess is probably present after considering uncertainties in the positron\nflux, although its amplitude depends strongly on the assumptions made in\nrelation to the electron flux. By fitting the current electron data, we show\nthat when considering a soft electron spectrum, the amplitude of the excess\nmight be far lower than usually claimed. We provide fresh insights that may\nhelp to explain the positron data with or without new physical model\ningredients. PAMELA observations and the forthcoming AMS-02 mission will allow\nstronger constraints to be aplaced on the cosmic--ray transport parameters, and\nare likely to reduce drastically the theoretical uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2008 18:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2008 10:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 17:53:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 17:06:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2009 17:20:18 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 14:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-06"}

Because of the long mean free path of photons with energies\nE<13.6 eV, the LWB was nearly uniform. However, some variation in the LWB is\nexpected due to the discrete nature of the sources, and their highly clustered\nspatial distribution. In this paper, we compute the probability distribution\nfunction (PDF) of the LW flux that irradiates dark matter (DM) halos collapsing\nat high-redshift (z~10). Our model accounts for (i) the clustering of DM halos,\n(ii) Poisson fluctuations in the number of corresponding star forming galaxies,\nand (iii) scatter in the LW luminosity produced by halos of a given mass\n(calibrated using local observations). We find that > 99% of the DM halos are\nilluminated by a LW flux within a factor of 2 of the global mean value.\nHowever, a small fraction, ~1e-8 to 1e-6, of DM halos with virial temperatures\nabove 1e4 K have a close luminous neighbor within < 10 kpc, and are exposed to\na LW flux exceeding the global mean by a factor of > 20, or to J_(21,LW)> 1e3\n(in units of 1e-21 erg/s/Hz/sr/cm^2). This large LW flux can photo--dissociate\nH_2 molecules in the gas collapsing due to atomic cooling in these halos, and\nprevent its further cooling and fragmentation. Such close halo pairs therefore\nprovide possible sites in which primordial gas clouds collapse directly into\nmassive black holes (M_BH~ 1e4 - 1e6 M_sun), and subsequently grow into\nsupermassive (M_BH > 1e9 M_sun) black holes by z~6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 13:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Higher-metallicity progenitors are more\nneutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive\n56Ni. We develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56Ni\nyield in SNe Ia and use it to test the theory with data from the Supernova\nLegacy Survey. We find that the average 56Ni yield does drop in SNe Ia from\nhigh metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% of\nthe dispersion in SN Ia 56Ni mass, and thus luminosity. This is because the\neffect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we find\nthat SN hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solar\nmetallicities. We also show that allowing for changes in O/Fe with the\nmetallicity [Fe/H] does not have a major effect on the theoretical prediction\nof Timmes, Brown & Truran, so long as one is using the O/H as the independent\nvariable. Age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that the\nluminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56Ni yield, and\nthus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. This is\nhard to understand if most SNe Ia explode when the primaries reach the\nChandrasekhar mass. Finally, we test the findings of Gallagher et al., that the\nresiduals of SNe Ia from the Hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxy\nmetallicity, and we find no such correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2008 21:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We employ linear\nregression to construct a polynomial that optimally fits the thermodynamic\nintegration data, and thus reduces the bias and uncertainty of the resulting\nfree energy estimate. Two test systems with analytical solutions were used to\nverify the accuracy and precision of the approach. Our results suggest that\nregression with a high degree of polynomials give the most accurate free energy\ndifference estimates, but often with a slightly larger variance, compared to\ncommonly used quadrature techniques. High degrees of polynomials possess the\nflexibility to closely fit the thermodynamic integration data but are often\nsensitive to small changes in data points. To further improve overall accuracy\nand reduce uncertainty, we also examine the use of Chebyshev nodes to guide the\nselection of non-equidistant lambda values for the thermodynamic integration\nscheme.

We argue that these hadrons can strongly influence the\ninterpretation of the low $p_T$ correlation data. We demonstrate this point\nthrough a simple geometrical jet absorption model simulation. The model shows\nthat the correlation between medium response hadrons dominates the pair yield\nand mimics the double hump structure of the away-side $\\Delta\\phi$ distribution\nat low $p_T$. This correlation was also shown to lead to complications in\ninterpreting the results on reaction plane dependence and three particle\ncorrelations.

Here, we propose and analyze a simple\nmodel of asexual biological evolution at expanding frontiers to explain these\nneutral patterns and predict the effect of natural selection. Our model\nattributes the observed gradual decrease in the number of sectors at the\nleading edge to an unbiased random walk of sector boundaries. Natural selection\nintroduces a deterministic bias in the wandering of domain boundaries that\nrenders beneficial mutations more likely to escape genetic drift and become\nestablished in a sector. We find that the opening angle of those sectors and\nthe rate at which they become established depend sensitively on the selective\nadvantage of the mutants. Deleterious mutations, on the other hand, are not\nable to establish a sector permanently. They can, however, temporarily \"surf\"\non the population front, and thereby reach unusual high frequencies. As a\nconsequence, expanding frontiers are susceptible to deleterious mutations as\nrevealed by the high fraction of mutants at mutation-selection balance.\nNumerically, we also determine the condition at which the wild type is lost in\nfavor of deleterious mutants (genetic meltdown) at a growing front. Our\nprediction for this error threshold differs qualitatively from existing\nwell-mixed theories, and sets tight constraints on sustainable mutation rates\nfor populations that undergo frequent range expansions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 04:06:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 08:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-12"}

The fit, typically poor at the\nhighest energies, requires a large density of target photons within the\nremnant; only a fraction of order $\\sim 10^{-6}$ of the background particles\ngets accelerated; the local magnetic field is of order $\\sim 20\\mu G$ and the\nmaximum energy of protons is much lower than the knee energy. Current HESS\ngamma ray observations combined with recent X-ray observations by Suzaku do not\nallow as yet to draw a definitive conclusion on whether RX J1713.7-3946 is an\nefficient cosmic ray accelerator, although at the present time a hadronic\ninterpretation of HESS data seems more likely. We discuss the implications of\nour results for the GLAST gamma ray telescope, which should be able to\ndiscriminate the two scenarios discussed above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 07:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The algorithm that programs the mind and makes the mind creative must\nbe sufficient for the mind to create primes. I found that primes are directly\nlinked to the creation algorithm of the mind. The essence of primes is the\nduality of uniqueness and uniformity together with the creation algorithm of\nthe mind.

Primes have the inherent property of\nunpredictability but can be generated by the creation algorithm of the mind,\ntermed the Prime Law, via a fully deterministic lawful process. This new\nunderstanding of the essence of primes can deduce some of the best-known\nproperties of primes, including the Riemann Hypothesis (RH).

The coronae of early M dwarfs display high X-ray luminosities and\ntemperatures, a pronounced inverse FIP effect, and frequent flaring to the\nextent that no quiescent level can be defined in many cases. For late M dwarfs,\nfewer but more violent flares have been observed, and the quiescent X-ray\nluminosity is much lower. To probe the relationship between coronal properties\nwith spectral type of active M dwarfs, we analyze the M3.5 and M4.5 components\nof the EQ Peg binary system in comparison with other active M dwarfs of\nspectral types M0.5 to M5.5. We investigate the timing behavior of both\ncomponents of the EQ Peg system, reconstruct their differential emission\nmeasure, and investigate the coronal abundance ratios based on emission-measure\nindependent line ratios from their Chandra HETGS spectra. Finally we test for\ndensity variations in different states of activity. The X-ray luminosity of EQ\nPeg A (M3.5) is by a factor of 6-10 brighter than that of EQ Peg B (M4.5). Like\nmost other active M dwarfs, the EQ Peg system shows an inverse FIP effect. The\nabundances of both components are consistent within the errors; however, there\nseems to be a tendency toward the inverse FIP effect being less pronounced in\nthe less active EQ Peg B when comparing the quiescent state of the two stars.\nThis trend is supported by our comparison with other M dwarfs. As the X-ray\nluminosity decreases with later spectral type, so do coronal temperatures and\nflare rate. The amplitude of the observed abundance anomalies, i.e. the inverse\nFIP effect, declines; however, clear deviations from solar abundances remain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 12:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here\nwe present an analysis of the following conceptual problems of the SCM: the\nviolation of energy conservation for local comoving volumes, the exact\nNewtonian form of the Friedmann equation, the absence of an upper limit on the\nreceding velocity of galaxies which can be greater than the speed of light, and\nthe presence of the linear Hubble law deeply inside inhomogeneous galaxy\ndistribution. The common cause of these paradoxes is the geometrical\ndescription of gravity, where there is no a well defined concept of the\nenergy-momentum tensor for the gravitational field, no energy quanta -\ngravitons, and no energy-momentum conservation for matter plus gravity because\ngravity is not a material field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 12:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-02"}

Also Hubble (1929) called the discovered\ndistance-redshift relation as \"De Sitter effect\". For homogeneous matter\ndistribution cosmological gravitational redshift is proportional to square of\ndistance: z_grav ~ r^2. However for a fractal matter distribution having the\nfractal dimension D=2 the global gravitational redshift is the linear function\nof distance: z_grav ~ r, which gives possibility for interpretation of the\nHubble law without the space expansion. Here the field gravity fractal\ncosmological model (FGF) is presented, which based on two initial principles.\nThe first assumption is that the Feynman's field gravity approach describes the\ngravitational interaction, which delivers a natural basis for the conceptual\nunity of all fundamental physical interactions within the framework of the\nrelativistic and quantum fields in Minkowski space. The second hypothesis is\nthat the spatial distribution of gravitating matter is a fractal at all scales\nup to the Hubble radius. The fractal dimension of matter distribution is\nassumed to be D = 2, which implies that the global gravitational redshift is\nthe explanation of the observed linear Hubble law. In the frame of the FGF all\nthree phenomena - the cosmic background radiation, the fractal large scale\nstructure, and the Hubble law, - could be the consequence of a unique large\nscale structure evolution process of the initially homogeneous ordinary matter\nwithout nonbaryonic matter and dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 13:25:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 18:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

Recent\nstellar models including rotation at very low metallicity predict a strong\nproduction of primary N14. Part of the nitrogen produced in the H-burning shell\ndiffuses by rotational mixing into the He core where it is converted to Ne22\nproviding additional neutrons for the s process. We present nucleosynthesis\ncalculations for a 25 Msun star at [Fe/H] = -3, -4, where in the convective\ncore He-burning about 0.8 % in mass is made of primary Ne22. The usual weak\ns-process shape is changed by the additional neutron source with a peak between\nSr and Ba, where the s-process yields increase by orders of magnitude with\nrespect to the yields obtained without rotation. Iron seeds are fully consumed\nand the maximum production of Sr, Y and Zr is reached. On the other hand, the\ns-process efficiency beyond Sr and the ratio Sr/Ba are strongly affected by the\namount of Ne22 and by nuclear uncertainties, first of all by the\nNe22(alpha,n)Mg25 reaction. Finally, assuming that Ne22 is primary in the\nconsidered metallicity range, the s-process efficiency decreases with\nmetallicity due to the effect of the major neutron poisons Mg25 and Ne22. This\nwork represents a first step towards the study of primary neutron source effect\nin fast rotating massive stars, and its implications are discussed in the light\nof spectroscopic observations of heavy elements at halo metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 15:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Stationary models suggest that this emission is due to\nshock-heated accreting material, but they do not allow to analyze the stability\nof such material and its position in the stellar atmosphere. We investigate the\ndynamics and the stability of shock-heated accreting material in CTTSs and the\nrole of the stellar chromosphere in determining the position and the thickness\nof the shocked region. We perform 1-D HD simulations of the impact of the\naccretion flow onto chromosphere of a CTTS, including the effects of gravity,\nradiative losses from optically thin plasma, thermal conduction and a well\ntested detailed model of the stellar chromosphere. Here we present the results\nof a simulation based on the parameters of the CTTS MP Mus. We find that the\naccretion shock generates an hot slab of material above the chromosphere with a\nmaximum thickness of 1.8X10^9 cm, density n_e~10^11-10^2 cm^-3, temperature\nT~3X10^6 K and uniform pressure equal to the ram pressure of the accretion flow\n(~450 dyn cm^-2). The base of the shocked region penetrates the chromosphere\nand stays where the ram pressure is equal to the thermal pressure. The system\nevolves with quasi-periodic instabilities of the material in the slab leading\nto cyclic disappearance and re-formation of the slab. For an accretion rate of\n~10^-10 M_sun yr^-1, the shocked region emits a time-averaged X-ray luminosity\nL_X~7X10^29 erg s^-1, which is comparable to the X-ray luminosity observed in\nCTTSs of the same mass. Furthermore, the X-ray spectrum synthesized from the\nsimulation matches in detail all the main features of the O VIII and O VII\nlines of the star MP Mus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 15:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Firstly, the fundamental theorem of skew invariant theory for the\nsymplectic group giving the generators and relations of symplectic invariants\nis established. The relations are the so called P_n relations which appear in\nthe study of certain 3-manifold invariants. Next a class of cohomology groups\nare introduced, called Pluri-Hodge groups (somewhat in keeping with the notion\nof pluri-canonical groups). These are Dolbeault groups on a complex manifold X\nwith values in tensor powers of sheaves of holomorphic forms of various\ndegrees. By Riemann-Roch one shows that knowledge of the Pluri-Hodge groups\ngives precise formulae for all Chern numbers of the manifold. When X is\nholomorphic symplectic the Pluri-Hodge groups form representations of Sp(g)\nwhere g counts the number of tensor products. Still with X holomorphic\nsymplectic, the Pluri-Hodge groups are vectors in the vector space H_g(X) of\nstates in the topological field theory of Rozansky and Witten for a 3-manifold\nwith boundary a Riemann surface of genus g. A formulation of the\nMurakami-Ohtsuki invariants, due to Sawon, allows us to show that quotients of\nthe spaces of trivalent graphs B_g carry representations of the symplectic\ngroup. There is a weight system W_X: B_g -> H_g(X) and we show that W_X\npreserves the various symplectic group actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2008 15:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-02"}
