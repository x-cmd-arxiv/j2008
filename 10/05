It is shown that if the\nchange in spatial topology is accompanied by a coupling constant it is possible\nto evaluate the path integral to all orders in the coupling and that the result\ncan be viewed as a hybrid between causal and Euclidian dynamical triangulation.\nThe second model we describe shows how a classical geometry with constant\nnegative curvature emerges naturally from a path integral over noncompact\nmanifolds. No initial singularity is present, hence the quantum geometry is\nnaturally compatible with the Hartle Hawking boundary condition. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that under certain conditions the quantum fluctuations are\nsmall! To conclude, we treat the problem of spacetime topology change.

In\nagreement with previous results in the literature, our results show that the\nonset of runaway collapse (formation of the first star) in subcritical clouds\nis significantly accelerated by nonlinear flows in which a large-scale wave\nmode dominates the power spectrum. In addition, we find that a power spectrum\nwith equal energy on all scales also accelerates collapse, but by a lesser\namount. For a highly super-Alfvenic initial velocity field with most power on\nthe largest scales, the collapse occurs promptly during the initial compression\nwave. However, for trans-Alfvenic perturbations, a subcritical magnetic field\ncauses a rebound from the initial compression, and the system undergoes several\noscillations before runaway collapse occurs. Models that undergo prompt\ncollapse have highly supersonic infall motions at the core boundaries. Cores in\nmagnetically subcritical models with trans-Alfvenic initial perturbations also\npick up significant systematic speeds by inheriting motions associated with\nmagnetically-driven oscillations. Core mass distributions are much broader than\nin models with small-amplitude initial perturbations, although the disturbed\nstructure of cores that form due to nonlinear flows does not guarantee\nsubsequent monolithic collapse.

The first appendix sketches a theory of duality\nfor monoidal categories, which generalizes the notion of a rigid monoidal\ncategory and is close in spirit to the Grothendieck-Verdier duality theory. In\nthe second one we use a topological field theory approach to define the\ncanonical braided monoidal structure and twist on the equivariant derived\ncategory of constructible sheaves on an algebraic group; moreover, we show that\nthis category carries an action of the surface operad.

We adopt the central cooling time,\nt_cool, as the diagnostic to ascertain cooling properties of the clusters and\nclassify clusters with t_cool < 1 Gyr as strong cooling core (SCC) clusters,\nwith 1 Gyr < t_cool <7.7 Gyr as weak cooling core (WCC) clusters and with\nt_cool > 7.7 Gyr as non-cooling core (NCC) clusters.

Further, we find that the\nprobability of finding a CCRS increases from 45% to 67% to 100% for NCC, WCC\nand SCC clusters, respectively, suggesting an AGN-feedback machinery in SCC\nclusters which regulates the cooling in the central regions.\n  We find L_R in SCC clusters depends strongly on the cluster scale such that\nmore massive clusters harbor more powerful radio AGN. The same trend is\nobserved between L_R and the classical mass deposition rate, MDR, albeit much\nstronger, in SCC and partly also in WCC clusters. We also perform correlations\nof the 2MASS K-band luminosity of the brightest cluster galaxy, L_BCG, with L_R\nand cluster parameters. We invoke the relation between L_BCG and the black hole\nmass, M_BH, and find a surprisingly tight correlation between M_BH and L_R for\nSCC clusters.

Extinctions, effective temperatures and\nluminosities are estimated for this sample, and used to construct H-R diagrams\nfor the population.

Such strong\nbackground contamination (25%) is consistent with the location of Serpens being\nclose to the Galactic plane (5degrees Galactic latitude). The remaining 58\nstars (75%) were all confirmed to be young, mostly K and M-type stars that are\npresumed to belong to the cloud. Individual ages and masses for the YSOs are\ninferred based on theoretical evolutionary models.

In particular,\nlarge abundances of the reactive ions HOC+ and CO+ have been measured in the\nnucleus of this galaxy. To investigate the origin of the large abundances of\nreactive ions in M82, we have completed our previous 30m HOC+ J=1-0\nobservations with the higher excitation HCO+ and HOC+ J=4-3 and 3-2 rotational\nlines.

Our HOC+ interferometric\nimage shows that the emission of the HOC+ 1-0 line is mainly restricted to the\nnuclear disk, with the maxima towards the E. and W. molecular peaks. In\naddition, line excitation calculations imply that the HOC+ emission arises in\ndense gas. Therefore, the HOC+ emission is arising in the dense PDRs embedded\nin the M82 nuclear disk, rather than in the intercloud phase and/or wind. We\nhave improved our previous chemical model of M82 by (i) using the new version\nof the Meudon PDR code, (ii) updating the chemical network, and (iii)\nconsidering two different types of clouds (with different thickness).
