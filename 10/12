In particular, we find that plates characterized by a\nlarge domain of hydrophobic sites induce a dewetting transition and an\nattractive solvent-induced interaction. On the other hand, a homogeneous\ndistribution of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles on the plates\nprevents the dewetting transition and produces a repulsive solvent-induced\ninteraction. We also present results for a kind of Janus interface in which one\nplate consists of hydrophobic particles and the other of hydrophilic particles\nshowing that the inter-plate gap remains wet until steric constraints at small\nseparations eject the water molecules.

GMR arises from differential scattering of\nthe majority and minority spin electrons by a ferromagnet (FM) so that the\nresistance when the FM layers separated by non-magnetic (NM) spacers are\naligned by an applied field is different to when they are antiparallel. In 1996\nSlonczewski[3] and Berger[4] predicted that a large spin-polarised current\ncould transfer spin-angular momentum and so exert a spin transfer torque (STT)\nsufficient to switch thin FM layers between stable magnetisation states[5] and,\nfor even higher current densities, drive continuous precession which emits\nmicrowaves[6]. Thus, while GMR is a purely passive phenomenon which ultimately\ndepends on the intrinsic band structure of the FM, STT adds an active element\nto spintronics by which the direction of the magnetisation may be manipulated.\nHere we show that highly non-equilibrium spin injection can modify the\nscattering asymmetry and, by extension, the intrinsic magnetism of a FM. This\nphenomenon is completely different to STT and provides a third ingredient which\nshould further expand the range of opportunities for the application of\nspintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Oct 2008 12:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-14"}

The density\nhypothesis is a conjectured estimate $N(\\lambda, T) =O\\bigl(T\\sp{2(1-\\lambda)\n+\\epsilon} \\bigr)$ for any $\\epsilon >0$, where $N(\\lambda, T)$ is the number\nof zeros of $\\zeta(s)$ when $\\Re(s) \\ge\\lambda$ and $0 <\\Im(s) \\le T$, with\n$1/2 \\le \\lambda \\le 1$ and $T >0$. The Riemann-von Mangoldt Theorem confirms\nthis estimate when $\\lambda =1/2$, with $T\\sp{\\epsilon}$ being replaced by\n$\\log T$. In an attempt to transform Backlund's proof of the Riemann-von\nMangoldt Theorem to a proof of the density hypothesis by convexity, we\ndiscovered a different approach utilizing an auxiliary function.

We show\nthat the ratio of mass of a Schwarzschild lens to the differential time delay\nbetween outermost two relativistic images (both of them either on the primary\nor on the secondary image side) is extremely insensitive to changes in the\nangular source position as well as the lens-source and lens-observer distances.\nTherefore, this ratio can be used to obtain very accurate values for masses of\nblack holes at centers of galaxies. Similarly, angular separations between any\ntwo relativistic images are also extremely insensitive to changes in the\nangular source position and the lens-source distance. Therefore, with the known\nvalue of mass of a black hole, angular separation between two relativistic\nimages would give a very accurate result for the distance of the black hole.\nAccuracies in determination of masses and distances of black holes would\nhowever depend on accuracies in measurements of differential time delays and\nangular separations between images. Deflection angles of primary and secondary\nimages as well as effective deflection angles of relativistic images on the\nsecondary image side are always positive. However, the effective deflection\nangles of relativistic images on the primary image side may be positive, zero,\nor negative depending on the value of angular source position and the ratio of\nmass of the lens to its distance. We show that effective deflection angles of\nrelativistic images play significant role in analyzing and understanding strong\ngravitational field lensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Oct 2008 15:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-13"}

The overarching scientific goal\nof THINGS is to investigate fundamental characteristics of the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) related to galaxy morphology, star formation and mass distribution\nacross the Hubble sequence. Unique characteristics of the THINGS database are\nthe homogeneous sensitivity as well as spatial and velocity resolution of the\nHI data which is at the limit of what can be achieved with the VLA for a\nsignificant number of galaxies. A sample of 34 objects at distances 2<D<15Mpc\n(resulting in linear resolutions of ~100 to 500pc) are targeted in THINGS,\ncovering a wide range of star formation rates (10^-3 to 6 M_sun/yr), total HI\nmasses M_HI (0.01 to 14x10^9 M_sun), absolute luminosities M_B (-11.5 to -21.7\nmag) and metallicities (7.5 to 9.2 in units of 12+log[O/H]). We describe the\nsetup of the VLA observations, the data reduction procedures and the creation\nof the final THINGS data products. We present an atlas of the integrated HI\nmaps, the velocity fields, the second moment (velocity dispersion) maps and\nindividual channel maps of each THINGS galaxy. The THINGS data products are\nmade publicly available through a dedicated webpage. Accompanying THINGS papers\naddress issues such as the small-scale structure of the ISM, the (dark) matter\ndistribution in THINGS galaxies, and the processes leading to star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Oct 2008 12:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}
