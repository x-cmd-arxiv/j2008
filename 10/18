Restricting our analysis to young massive (OB) stars we\nconfirm our results obtained for M33, namely that the luminosity function of\nthe groups is well described by a power-law with index -2, and that there is no\ncharacteristic length-scale of star-forming regions. We find that stars in the\nLMC are born with a large amount of substructure, consistent with a 2D fractal\ndistribution with dimension ~1.8 and evolve towards a uniform distribution on a\ntimescale of ~175 Myr. This is comparable to the crossing time of the galaxy\nand we suggest that stellar structure, regardless of spatial scale, will be\neliminated in a crossing time. This may explain the smooth distribution of\nstars in massive/dense young clusters in the Galaxy, while other, less massive,\nclusters still display large amounts of structure at similar ages. By comparing\nthe stellar and star cluster distributions and evolving timescales, we show\nthat infant mortality of clusters (or 'popping clusters') have a negligible\ninfluence on galactic structure. Finally, we quantify the influence of the\nelongation, differential extinction, and contamination of a population on the\nmeasured Q value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2008 16:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

We employ the Pencil Code,\ntracing the solids with a large number of interacting Lagrangian particles,\nusually 100,000.

For 10 cm, the final maximum collapsed mass is\naround 3 Earth masses. The collapse of the 1 cm particles is indirect,\nfollowing the timescale of depletion of gas from the tadpole orbits.

By using multiple particle species, we find that\ngas drag modifies the streamlines in the tadpole region around the classical L4\nand L5 points. As a result, particles of different radii have their stable\npoints shifted to different locations. Collapse therefore takes longer and\nproduces planets of lower mass.

In particular, we address the electromagnetic form factors\nand decay constants of the pion, kaon and D mesons. The structure of composite\nsystems are given by the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) amplitude of a meson formed by a\nconfined pair of constituent quark and antiquark, which in our work is written\nin terms of Pauli-Villars regulators. The analytical structure contains single\npoles in the complex momentum space. The BS amplitude takes into account poles\ndue to the regulator parameters, while the quark-antiquark cut is avoided,\nimplying in confined quarks with the property that the sum of the constituents\nmasses can be larger than the mass of the meson. The one-loop expressions of\nthe electroweak transition amplitudes are conveniently written in terms of\nlight-front momentum. Technically, we introduce a Wick-rotation of he minus\ncomponent of the momentum (k-minus) in the one-loop amplitudes allowing to\navoid the cuts in the complex plane of this momentum variable without crossing\nthem. This is particularly useful as we can study the electroweak properties\nwith several models of the BS amplitude with different powers of Pauli-Villars\nregulators. The possibility to change the power of the BS amplitude is\ninteresting in order to test the asymptotic behavior of the electromagnetic\nform factors searching for a suitable form that incorporates the expected QCD\ndecaying power-law form.

The algorithm is iterative and produces a sequence of matrices (X^k,\nY^k) and at each step, mainly performs a soft-thresholding operation on the\nsingular values of the matrix Y^k. There are two remarkable features making\nthis attractive for low-rank matrix completion problems. The first is that the\nsoft-thresholding operation is applied to a sparse matrix; the second is that\nthe rank of the iterates X^k is empirically nondecreasing. Both these facts\nallow the algorithm to make use of very minimal storage space and keep the\ncomputational cost of each iteration low. We provide numerical examples in\nwhich 1,000 by 1,000 matrices are recovered in less than a minute on a modest\ndesktop computer. We also demonstrate that our approach is amenable to very\nlarge scale problems by recovering matrices of rank about 10 with nearly a\nbillion unknowns from just about 0.4% of their sampled entries. Our methods are\nconnected with linearized Bregman iterations for l1 minimization, and we\ndevelop a framework in which one can understand these algorithms in terms of\nwell-known Lagrange multiplier algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2008 02:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-21"}

The EDM is not induce by\nthe external field but is inherent behavior of the atom. But the calculation of\nquantum mechanics tells us that unperturbed states of hydrogen atom have no\nEDM! In the effect, two of four states have no energy shift. What are the EDM\nof the hydrogen atoms in the two states? Quantum mechanics can not answer the\nproblem. The statement that the EDM of the two states is perpendicular to the\nfield only comes from guesses in quantum mechanics. The two problems had\npuzzled physicists for more than 80 years. By introducing a new parameter this\narticle gives a satisfactory explanation for the effect. Our calculation\ndiscovered that, in the unperturbed states, the atoms not only have EDM with\n3eao but also can have only three directions of quantization! It is an entirely\nunexpected discovery.
