The resulting magnetic field\ndisplays propagating wave-like behavior. This behavior can be modelled in terms\nof an \\alpha\\Omega dynamo. In most cases super-equipartition fields are\ngenerated. By varying the fraction of helicity of the turbulence the\nregeneration of poloidal fields via the helicity effect (corresponding to the\n\\alpha-effect) is regulated. The saturation level of the magnetic field in the\nnumerical models is consistent with a linear dependence on the ratio of the\nfractional helicities of the small and large-scale fields, as predicted by a\nsimple nonlinear mean-field model. As the magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) based\non the wavenumber of the energy-carrying eddies is increased from 1 to 180, the\ncycle frequency of the large-scale field is found to decrease by a factor of\nabout 6 in cases where the turbulence is fully helical. This is interpreted in\nterms of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity, which is found to be only weakly\ndependent on Rm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2008 17:05:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 09:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

They may have several possibilities\n(of routes or deparure time), but their choices modify the travel times on the\nnetwork. Hence, each user faces the following problem: given a pattern of\ntravel times for the different possible routes that reach the destination, find\na shortest path. The situation in a context of perfect information is a\nso-called Nash equilibrium, and the question whether there is such an\nequilibrium and of finding it if it exists is the so-called equilibrium\nassignment problem. It arises for various kind of networks, such as computers,\ncommunication or transportation network. When each user occupies permanently\nthe whole route from the origin to its destination, we call it the static\nassignment problem, which has been extensively studied with pioneers works by\nWardrop or Beckmann. A less studied, but more realistic, and maybe more\ndifficult, problem is when the time needed to reach an arc is taken into\naccount. We speak then of a dynamic assignment problem. Several models have\nbeen proposed. For some of them, the existence of an equilibrium has been\nproved, but always under some technical assumptions or in a very special case\n(a network with one arc for the case when the users may chose their departure\ntime). The present paper proposes a compact model, with minimal and natural\nassumptions. For this model, we prove that there is always an equilibrium. To\nour knowledge, this imply all previous results about existence of an\nequilibrium for the dynamic assignment problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2008 16:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-15"}

It starts from\nthe Smoluchowski equation of interacting Brownian particles in a given shear\nflow, derives generalized Green-Kubo relations, which contain the transients\ndynamics formally exactly, and closes the equations using mode coupling\napproximations. Shear thinning of colloidal fluids and dynamical yielding of\ncolloidal glasses arise from a competition between a slowing down of structural\nrelaxation, because of particle interactions, and enhanced decorrelation of\nfluctuations, caused by the shear advection of density fluctuations. The\nintegration through transients approach takes account of the dynamic\ncompetition, translational invariance enters the concept of wavevector\nadvection, and the mode coupling approximation enables to quantitatively\nexplore the shear-induced suppression of particle caging and the resulting\nspeed-up of the structural relaxation. Extended comparisons with shear stress\ndata in the linear response and in the nonlinear regime measured in model\nthermo-sensitive core-shell latices are discussed.

Many\npseudobulges are recognizable as cold, rapidly rotating, disky structures.\nBulges have Sersic function brightness profiles with index n > 2; most\npseudobulges have n <= 2. Recognition of pseudobulges makes the biggest problem\nwith cold dark matter galaxy formation more acute: How can hierarchical\nclustering make so many pure disk galaxies with no evidence for merger-built\nbulges?

The average molecular gas depletion\ntime is ~2*10^9 yrs. We interpret the linear relation and constant depletion\ntime as evidence that stars are forming in GMCs with approximately uniform\nproperties and that the H2 SD may be more a measure of the filling fraction of\ngiant molecular clouds than changing conditions in the molecular gas.\n  The relationship between total gas SD and SFR SD varies dramatically among\nand within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show little or no correlation between\nthe HI SD and the SFR SD. As a result, the star formation efficiency (SFE = SFR\nSD / gas SD) varies strongly across our sample and within individual galaxies.\nWe show that in spirals the SFE is a clear function of radius, while the dwarf\ngalaxies in our sample display SFEs similar to those found in the outer optical\ndisks of the spirals. Another general feature of our sample is a sharp\nsaturation of the HI SD at ~9 M_sol/pc^2 in both the spiral and dwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2008 20:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

We use HI maps from THINGS and derive H2\nmaps from HERACLES and BIMA SONG CO. We estimate the star formation rate by\ncombining GALEX FUV maps and SINGS 24 micron maps, infer stellar surface\ndensity profiles from SINGS 3.6 micron data, and use kinematics from THINGS. We\nmeasure the SFE as a function of: the free-fall and orbital timescales;\nmidplane gas pressure; stability of the gas disk to collapse (including the\neffects of stars); the ability of perturbations to grow despite shear; and the\nability of a cold phase to form. In spirals, the SFE of H2 alone is nearly\nconstant at 5.25 +/- 2.5 x 10^(-10) yr^(-1) (equivalent to an H2 depletion time\nof 1.9x10^9 yr) as a function of all of these variables at our 800 pc\nresolution. Where the ISM is mostly HI, on the other hand, the SFE decreases\nwith increasing radius in both spiral and dwarf galaxies, a decline reasonably\ndescribed by an exponential with scale length 0.2-0.25 r_25. We interpret this\ndecline as a strong dependence of GMC formation on environment. The ratio of H2\nto HI appears to be a smooth function of radius, stellar surface density, and\npressure spanning from the H2-dominated to HI-dominated ISM. The radial decline\nin SFE is too steep to be reproduced only by increases in the free-fall time or\norbital time. Thresholds for large-scale instability suggest that our disks are\nstable or marginally stable and do not show a clear link to the declining SFE.\nWe suggest that ISM physics below the scales that we observe - phase balance in\nthe HI, H2 formation and destruction, and stellar feedback - governs the\nformation of GMCs from HI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 12:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

This is based on a blueshift of 2650 km/s of the broad\nemission lines (\"b-system\") relative to the narrow emission lines (\"r-system\")\npresumed to reflect the galaxy velocity. New observations with the Hobby-Eberly\nTelescope (HET) confirm the essential features of the spectrum.

A composite spectrum of SDSS QSOs similar to J0927 illustrates\nthe feasibility of detecting the calcium K absorption line in spectra of\nsufficient quality. The i-system may represent the QSO host galaxy or a\ncompanion. Photoionization requires the black hole to be ~3 kpc from the\nr-system emitting gas, implying that we are observing the system only 10^6 yr\nafter the recoil event and contributing to the low probability of observing\nsuch a system. The HET observations give an upper limit of 10 km/s per year on\nthe rate of change of the velocity difference between the r- and b-systems,\nconstraining the orbital phase in the binary model.

This dissertation makes a\nthreefold contribution to the mathematical theory of quantum error-correcting\ncodes. Firstly, it extends the framework of an important class of quantum codes\n-- nonbinary stabilizer codes. It clarifies the connections of stabilizer codes\nto classical codes over quadratic extension fields, provides many new\nconstructions of quantum codes, and develops further the theory of optimal\nquantum codes and punctured quantum codes. Secondly, it contributes to the\ntheory of operator quantum error correcting codes also called as subsystem\ncodes. These codes are expected to have efficient error recovery schemes than\nstabilizer codes. This dissertation develops a framework for study and analysis\nof subsystem codes using character theoretic methods. In particular, this work\nestablishes a close link between subsystem codes and classical codes showing\nthat the subsystem codes can be constructed from arbitrary classical codes.\nThirdly, it seeks to exploit the knowledge of noise to design efficient quantum\ncodes and considers more realistic channels than the commonly studied\ndepolarizing channel. It gives systematic constructions of asymmetric quantum\nstabilizer codes that exploit the asymmetry of errors in certain quantum\nchannels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2008 22:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-16"}

The local region around a protoplanet in a protoplanetary disk is\nconsidered with sufficient spatial resolution: the region from outside the Hill\nsphere to the Jovian radius is covered by the nested-grid method. To\ninvestigate the thermal effects of the circumplanetary disk, various equations\nof state are adopted. Large thermal energy around the protoplanet slightly\nchanges the structure of the circumplanetary disk. Compared with a model\nadopting an isothermal equation of state, in a model with an adiabatic equation\nof state, the protoplanet's gas envelope extends farther, and a slightly thick\ndisk appears near the protoplanet. However, different equations of state do not\naffect the acquisition process of angular momentum for the protoplanetary\nsystem. Thus, the specific angular momentum acquired by the system is fitted as\na function only of the protoplanet's mass. A large fraction of the total\nangular momentum contributes to the formation of the circumplanetary disk. The\ndisk forms only in a compact region in very close proximity to the protoplanet.\nAdapting the results to the solar system, the proto-Jupiter and Saturn have\ncompact disks in the region of r < 21 r_J (r < 0.028 r_HJ) and r < 66 r_S (r <\n0.061 r_HS), respectively, where r_J (r_HJ) and r_S (r_HS) are the Jovian and\nSaturnian (Hill) radius, respectively. The surface density has a peak in these\nregions due to the balance between centrifugal force and gravity of the\nprotoplanet. The size of these disks corresponds well to the outermost orbit of\nregular satellites around Jupiter and Saturn. Regular satellites may form in\nsuch compact disks around proto-gas giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 02:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-16"}

Although the protein is not a\ntransporter, we speculate that it has the binding site force field similar to\nthat of an important intestinal transporter. The observation helped us to\nimprove the passive absorption model by adding non-liner flux associated with\nthe transporting protein to obtain a quantitative model of active transport.\nThis study demonstrates that binding data to a sufficiently representative set\nof proteins can serve as a basis for active absorption prediction for a given\ncompound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 07:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-16"}

Hence, the strength of the\napplied stress can be deduced from measurement of induced change in the beat\nfrequency between the two polarizations or between the fast mode (mode\npolarized in the orthogonal direction of the stress) and a reference frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 09:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The origin of\ngenetic robustness, whether it evolves directly by natural selection or it is a\ncorrelated byproduct of other phenotypic traits, is, however, unresolved.\nExamining microRNA (miRNA) genes of several eukaryotic species, Borenstein and\nRuppin (Borenstein et al. 2006, PNAS 103: 6593), showed that the structure of\nmiRNA precursor stem-loops exhibits significantly increased mutational\nrobustness in comparison with a sample of random RNA sequences with the same\nstem-loop structure. The observed robustness was found to be uncorrelated with\ntraditional measures of environmental robustness -- implying that miRNA\nsequences show evidence of the direct evolution of genetic robustness. These\nfindings are surprising as theoretical results indicate that the direct\nevolution of robustness requires high mutation rates and/or large effective\npopulation sizes only found among RNA viruses, not multicellular eukaryotes.\nIntroducing a novel measure of environmental robustness based on the\nequilibrium thermodynamic ensemble of secondary structures of the miRNA\nprecursor sequences we demonstrate that the biophysics of RNA folding, induces\na high level of correlation between genetic (mutational) and environmental\n(thermodynamic) robustness, as expected from the theory of plastogenetic\ncongruence introduced by Ancel and Fontana (Ancel et al. 2000, J.

However, [O III] in particular shows an\nincrease up to day ~6800. This agrees with radiative shock models where the\npre-shocked gas is heated by the soft X-rays from the shock. The line emission\nfrom the shocked gas increases rapidly as the shock sweeps up more gas. We find\nthat the neutral and high ionization lines follow the evolution of the Balmer\nlines roughly, while the intermediate ionization lines evolve less rapidly. Up\nto day ~6800, the optical light curves have a similar evolution to that of the\nsoft X-rays. The break between day 6500 and day 7000 for [O III] and [Ne III]\nis likely due to recombination to lower ionization levels. Nevertheless, the\nevolution of the [Fe XIV] line, as well as the lines from the lowest ionization\nstages, continue to follow that of the soft X-rays, as expected. There is a\nclear difference in the line profiles between the low and intermediate\nionization lines, and those from the coronal lines at the earlier epochs. This\nshows that these lines arise from regions with different physical conditions,\nwith at least a fraction of the coronal lines coming from adiabatic shocks. At\nlater epochs the line widths of the low ionization lines, however, increase and\napproach those of the high ionization lines of [Fe X-XIV]. The H-alpha line\nprofile can be traced up to ~500 km/s at the latest epoch. This is consistent\nwith the cooling time of shocks propagating into a density of (1-4)x10^4 cm-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 11:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The CMDs are constructed using 2MASS \\jj, \\hh, and \\ks bands, and the\nintrinsic morphologies of the target OCs within these diagrams are revealed by\napplying a field-star decontamination algorithm. Fundamental parameters are\nestimated with Padova isochrones built for the 2MASS filters.

The {\\it cubicity} of\n$G$, denoted as $cub(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ is the intersection\ngraph of a collection of $k$-cubes. Many NP-complete graph problems can be\nsolved efficiently or have good approximation ratios in graphs of low cubicity.\nIn most of these cases the first step is to get a low dimensional cube\nrepresentation of the given graph.\n  It is known that for a graph $G$, $cub(G) \\leq \\lfloor\\frac{2n}{3}\\rfloor$.\nRecently it has been shown that for a graph $G$, $cub(G) \\leq 4(\\Delta + 1)\\ln\nn$, where $n$ and $\\Delta$ are the number of vertices and maximum degree of\n$G$, respectively. In this paper, we show that for a bipartite graph $G = (A\n\\cup B, E)$ with $|A| = n_1$, $|B| = n_2$, $n_1 \\leq n_2$, and $\\Delta' =\n\\min\\{\\Delta_A, \\Delta_B\\}$, where $\\Delta_A = {max}_{a \\in A}d(a)$ and\n$\\Delta_B = {max}_{b \\in B}d(b)$, $d(a)$ and $d(b)$ being the degree of $a$ and\n$b$ in $G$ respectively, $cub(G) \\leq 2(\\Delta'+2) \\lceil \\ln n_2 \\rceil$.

Explicitly, a family of\nevolving Lorentzian wormholes conformally related to another family of\nzero-tidal force static wormhole geometries is found in Einstein gravity.\nContrary to the standard wormhole approach, where first a convenient geometry\nis fixed and then the matter distribution is derived, we follow the\nconventional approach for finding solutions in theoretical cosmology. We derive\nan analytical evolving wormhole geometry by supposing that the radial tension\n(which is negative to the radial pressure) and the pressure measured in the\ntangential directions have barotropic equations of state with constant state\nparameters. At spatial infinity this evolving wormhole, supported by this\nanisotropic matter, is asymptotically flat, and its slices $t=$ constant are\nspaces of constant curvature. During its evolution the shape of the wormhole\nexpands with constant velocity, i.e without acceleration or deceleration, since\nthe scale factor has strictly a linear evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 14:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We present numerical simulations of\nthe infall of a giant molecular cloud that interacts with the black hole. The\ntransfer of energy during closest approach allows part of the cloud to become\nbound to the black hole, forming an eccentric disc that quickly fragments to\nform stars. Compressional heating due to the black hole raises the temperature\nof the gas to 100-1000K, ensuring that the fragmentation produces relatively\nhigh stellar masses. These stars retain the eccentricity of the disc and, for a\nsufficiently massive initial cloud, produce an extremely top-heavy distribution\nof stellar masses. This potentially repetitive process can therefore explain\nthe presence of multiple eccentric rings of young stars in the presence of a\nsupermassive black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 15:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
