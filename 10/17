Because of\nthis finding it has been suggested that the emergence of orientation\nselectivity may be explained by higher-order redundancy reduction. In order to\nassess the tenability of this hypothesis, it is an important empirical question\nhow much more redundancies can be removed with ICA in comparison to PCA, or\nother second-order decorrelation methods. This question has not yet been\nsettled, as over the last ten years contradicting results have been reported\nranging from less than five to more than hundred percent extra gain for ICA.\nHere, we aim at resolving this conflict by presenting a very careful and\ncomprehensive analysis using three evaluation criteria related to redundancy\nreduction: In addition to the multi-information and the average log-loss we\ncompute, for the first time, complete rate-distortion curves for ICA in\ncomparison with PCA. Without exception, we find that the advantage of the ICA\nfilters is surprisingly small. Furthermore, we show that a simple spherically\nsymmetric distribution with only two parameters can fit the data even better\nthan the probabilistic model underlying ICA. Since spherically symmetric models\nare agnostic with respect to the specific filter shapes, we conlude that\norientation selectivity is unlikely to play a critical role for redundancy\nreduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2008 19:11:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2008 20:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For this purpose,\nwe used our own NLTE models and tested which stellar parameters of the first\nstars at different evolutionary stages result in CNO winds. If such winds are\npossible, we calculate their hydrodynamic structure and predict their\nparameters. We show that, while the studied stars do not have any wind driven\npurely by hydrogen and helium, CNO driven winds exist in more luminous stars.\nOn the other hand, for very hot stars, CNO elements are too ionized to drive a\nwind.

This is because wind mass-loss rate in present\nhot stars is dominated by elements heavier than CNO.

Density-functional theory calculations\nquantitatively reproduced this effect, allowed separation of initial and final\nstate contributions, and provided an explanation in terms of a roughly constant\ncharge transfer per O atom. We have now conducted similar measurements and\ncalculations for three well-defined adsorbate and coadsorbate layers containing\nO and H atoms: (1 x 1)-H, (2 x 2)-(O+H), and (2 x 2)-(O+3H) on Ru(0001). As H\nis stabilized in fcc sites in the prior two structures and in hcp sites in the\nlatter, this enables us to not only study coverage and coadsorption effects on\nthe adsorbate-induced SCLSs, but also the sensitivity to similar adsorption\nsites.

The additivity of the next-neighbor\nadsorbate-induced SCLSs is found to prevail even for the coadsorbate\nstructures.

For the range of exit velocities, from 1500 m/s to 5000 m/s, we find the\nhighest temperatures are near the gun breech.

In this\npaper we place two phenomenological constraints on these operators at dimension\nd<=11. First, we require that the operators obey the quark flavor symmetries of\nthe Standard Model, with any violation of the symmetries being due to Yukawa\ninteractions, a scheme known as Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV). Second, we\nrequire that the operators which generate neutrinoless double beta-decay, and\nany operators related by the flavor symmetries, do not induce neutrino masses\nabove 0.05 eV, the limit implied by the atmospheric neutrino data. We find that\nthese requirements severely constrain the operators which can violate lepton\nnumber, such that most can no longer contribute to neutrinoless double\nbeta-decay at observable rates. It is noteworthy that quark flavor symmetries\ncan play such a strong role in constraining new leptonic physics, even when\nthat physics is not quark flavor changing.

The model includes the antiferromagnetic chains of Ti ions immersed\nin the phonon bath of the bilayer structure. Making use of the Cross-Fisher\ntheory, we show that the geometrically frustrated character of the lattice is\nresponsible for the structural instability which leads the chains to an\nincommensurate phase without an applied magnetic field. In the case of TiOCl,\nwe show that our model is consistent with the measured phonon frequencies at\n$T=300K$ and the value of the incommensuration vector at the transition\ntemperature. Moreover, we find that the dynamical structure factor shows a\nprogressive softening of an incommensurate phonon near the zone boundary as the\ntemperature decreases. This softening is accompanied by a broadening of the\npeak which gets asymmetrical as well when going towards the transition\ntemperature. These features are in agreement with the experimental inelastic\nX-ray measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2008 20:31:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 20:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-28"}

Employing direct tilted-ring fits to the data cube\nas introduced in Paper I, we perform an analysis of the \"Spindle\" galaxy NGC\n2685, previously regarded as two-ringed polar ring galaxy.\n  Deep HI and optical (i'-band) observations are presented. The HI observations\nstrongly suggest that the gaseous structure of NGC 2685 does not consist of two\nseparate mutually inclined regions, but forms a coherent, extremely warped\ndisk, the appearance of two rings being due to projection effects. By comparing\nthe HI total-intensity maps with the optical image we demonstrate that at large\nradii a faint stellar disk is well aligned with the outer HI disk. The shape of\nthe dust-lanes obscuring the NE part of the inner stellar body indicates that\nalso at smaller radii NGC 2685 possesses a disk containing gas, dust, and stars\nin which the various constituents are aligned. At smaller radii, this disk is\nkinematically decoupled from the central stellar body. Hence, in the region of\nthe bright, central stellar body, NGC 2685 appears to consist of two disks that\nshare a common centre, but have different orientation: a bright stellar\nlenticular body apparently devoid of dust and gas, and a heavily warped\nlow-surface brightness disk containing stars, gas and dust. The\nlow-surface-brightness disk changes its orientation gradually and at large\nradii assumes the orientation of the central stellar S0 disk. Since, according\nto our analysis, the intrinsic orientation of the low-surface-brightness disk\nchanges through 70 degrees, the gaseous disk is coherent, and is at no radius\norientated perpendicularly with respect to the central stellar body, NGC 2685\nis likely not a classical polar-ring galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2008 10:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The charm and bottom cross\nsection extracted from the measured dielectron yield are sigma_cc = 544 +/-\n39(stat.) +/- 142(syst.) +/- 200(model) microbarns and sigma_bb = 3.9 +/-\n2.4(stat.) +3/-2(syst.) microbarns, respectively.\n  In min. bias Au+Au collisions the yield of dielectrons in the low mass region\nis enhanced by a factor of 4.0 +/- 0.3(stat.) +/- 1.5(syst.) +/- 0.8(model)\ncompared to the known hadronic sources. The excess dominates the yield in the\ntransverse momentum region below 1 GeV/c and shows significantly lower average\np_T than the expected sources. The low p_T enhancement is currently not\nunderstood by any theoretical model of heavy ion collisions. The enhancement\nextends to larger transverse momenta where it is also observed in p+p and\nexplained by virtual direct photons.

We demonstrate that for low fermion-boson mass ratio\nthe density dependence of quantum nucleation transition rate is experimentally\nobservable. The crossover to macroscopic quantum tunneling regime is analyzed.\nBased on a microscopic description of interacting cold atom boson-fermion\nmixtures we derive an effective action for the critical droplet and obtain an\nasymptotic expression for the nucleation rate in the vicinity of the phase\ntransition and near the spinodal instability of the mixed phase.

These are among the most distant\nsubmillimeter-selected galaxies reliably identified through CO emission and\nalso some of the most luminous known. In terms of CO to bolometric\nluminosities, stellar mass and star formation rates (SFRs), these newly\ndiscovered z>4 SMGs are similar to z~1.5-3 SMGs studied to date. These z~4 SMGs\nhave much higher specific SFRs than typical B-band dropout Lyman break galaxies\nat the same redshift. The stellar mass-SFR correlation for normal galaxies does\nnot seem to evolve much further, between z~2 and z~4. A significant z=4.05\nspectroscopic redshift spike is observed in GOODS-N, and a strong spatial\noverdensity of B-band dropouts and IRAC selected z>3.5 galaxies appears to be\ncentered on the GN20 and GN20.2 galaxies. This suggests a proto-cluster\nstructure with total mass ~10^14 Msun. Using photometry at mid-IR, submm and\nradio wavelengths, we show that reliable photometric redshifts (Dz/(1+z)~0.1)\ncan be derived for SMGs over 1<z<4. This new photometric redshift technique has\nbeen used to provide a first estimate of the space density of 3.5<z<6\nhyper-luminous starburst galaxies, and to show that they contribute\nsubstantially to the SFR density at early epochs.

Given that Herschel and ALMA will open up new possibilities for\nastronomical FIR and sub-mm spectroscopy, data characterizing the dielectric\nproperties of these materials at long wavelengths are desirable. We aimed at\nexamining the FIR spectra of talc, picrolite, montmorillonite, and chamosite,\nwhich belong to four different groups of phyllosilicates. We tabulated\npositions and band widths of the FIR bands of these minerals depending on the\ndust temperature. By means of powder transmission spectroscopy, spectra of the\nexamined materials were measured in the wavelength range 25-500 mum at\ntemperatures of 300, 200, 100, and 10 K. Room-temperature measurements yield\nthe following results. For talc, a previously unknown band, centered at 98.5\nmum, was found, in addition to bands at 56.5 and 59.5 mum. For montmorillonite,\nseveral bands at wavelengths <110 mum were detected, including a band at 105\nmum with an FWHM of about 10 mum. Picrolite shows a sharp 77 mum FIR band.\nChamosite is characterized by bands in the 72-92 mum range, and a prominent\nband at 277 mum. At decreasing temperature, most of the bands shift to shorter\nwavelengths. Examining a potential counterpart of the 105mum band in the\nspectra of HD 142527 and HD 100546, we find that the broad band in the spectra\nof these young stars - extending from 85 to 125 mum - cannot be due to\nmontmorillonite or any of the hydrous silicates we studied, since these\nmaterials have sharper bands in the FIR wavelength range than previously\nassumed, especially at low temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2008 09:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We investigate the cosmological evolution of large- and small-scale\nmagnetic fields in galaxies in the light of present models of formation and\nevolution of galaxies. Methods. We use the dynamo theory to derive the\ntimescales of amplification and ordering of magnetic fields in disk and puffy\ngalaxies. Turbulence in protogalactic halos generated by thermal virialization\ncan drive an efficient turbulent dynamo. Results from simulations of\nhierarchical structure formation cosmology provide a tool to develop an\nevolutionary model of regular magnetic fields coupled with galaxy formation and\nevolution. Results. The turbulent (small-scale) dynamo was able to amplify a\nweak seed magnetic field in halos of protogalaxies to a few muG strength within\na few 10^8 yr. This turbulent field served as a seed to the mean-field\n(large-scale) dynamo. Galaxies similar to the Milky Way formed their disks at\nz~10 and regular fields of muG strength and a few kpc coherence length were\ngenerated within 2 Gyr (at z~3), but field-ordering on the coherence scale of\nthe galaxy size required an additional 6 Gyr (at z~0.5). Giant galaxies formed\ntheir disks at z~10, allowing more efficient dynamo generation of strong\nregular fields (with kpc coherence length) already at z~4. However, the age of\nthe Universe is short for fully coherent fields in giant galaxies larger than\n15 kpc to have been achieved. Dwarf galaxies should have hosted fully coherent\nfields at z~1. After a major merger, the strength of the turbulent field is\nenhanced by a factor of a few. Conclusions. This evolutionary scenario can be\ntested by measurements of polarized synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation\nwith the planned SKA.

The cycle structure of such a system can be described by the\nelementary divisors of the linear function, and the problem of determining\nwhether the system is a fixed point system can be answered by computing and\nfactoring the system's characteristic polynomial and minimal polynomial. It has\nbecome clear recently that the study of finite linear dynamical systems must be\nextended to embrace finite rings. The difficulty of dealing with an arbitrary\nfinite commutative ring is that it lacks of unique factorization. In this\npaper, an efficient algorithm is provided for analyzing the cycle structure of\na linear dynamical system over a finite commutative ring. In particular, for a\ngiven commutative ring $R$ such that $|R|=q$, where $q$ is a positive integer,\nthe algorithm determines whether a given linear system over $R^n$ is a fixed\npoint system or not in time $O(n^3\\log(n\\log(q)))$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2008 14:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-20"}

In [1] this\nproblem was studied for multi-unit auctions with unit demand bidders and for\nthe public project problem, and in each case social welfare undominated\nmechanisms in the class of feasible and incentive compatible mechanisms were\nidentified. One way to improve upon these optimality results is by allowing the\nplayers to move sequentially. With this in mind, we study here sequential\nversions of two feasible Groves mechanisms used for single item auctions: the\nVickrey auction and the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism. Because of the absence of\ndominant strategies in this sequential setting, we focus on a weaker concept of\nan optimal strategy. For each mechanism we introduce natural optimal strategies\nand observe that in each mechanism these strategies exhibit different\nbehaviour. However, we then show that among all optimal strategies, the one we\nintroduce for each mechanism maximizes the social welfare when each player\nfollows it. The resulting social welfare can be larger than the one obtained in\nthe simultaneous setting. Finally, we show that, when interpreting both\nmechanisms as simultaneous ones, the vectors of the proposed strategies form a\nPareto optimal Nash equilibrium in the class of optimal strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2008 15:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-20"}
