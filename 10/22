An iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal achievable\nrate region, when each relay employs an amplify and forward (AF) strategy.\n  The iterative algorithm solves a power minimization problem at every step,\nsubject to minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio constraints, which is\nnon-convex, however, for which the Karush Kuhn Tuker conditions are sufficient\nfor optimality. The optimal AF strategy assumes global channel state\ninformation (CSI) at each relay. To simplify the CSI requirements, a simple\namplify and forward strategy, called dual channel matching, is also proposed,\nthat requires only local channel state information, and whose achievable rate\nregion is close to that of the optimal AF strategy. In the asymptotic regime of\nlarge number of relays, we show that the achievable rate region of the dual\nchannel matching and an upper bound differ by only a constant term and\nestablish the capacity scaling law of the two-way relay channel.

It is well known since Minty, Rockafellar,\nand Bertsekas-Eckstein that in Hilbert space, monotone operators can be\nunderstood and analyzed from the alternative viewpoint of firmly nonexpansive\nmappings, which were found to be precisely the resolvents of monotone\noperators. For example, the proximal mappings in the sense of Moreau are\nprecisely the resolvents of subdifferential operators. More general notions of\n\"resolvent\", \"proximal mapping\" and \"firmly nonexpansive\" have been studied.\nOne important class, popularized chiefly by Alber and by Kohsaka and Takahashi,\nis based on the normalized duality mapping. Furthermore, Censor and Lent\npioneered the use of the gradient of a well behaved convex functions in a\nBregman-distance based framework. It is known that resolvents are firmly\nnonexpansive, but the converse has been an open problem for the latter\nframework.\n  In this note, we build on the very recent characterization of maximal\nmonotonicity due to Martinez-Legaz to provide a framework for studying\nresolvents in which firmly nonexpansive mappings are always resolvents. This\nframework includes classical resolvents, resolvents based on the normalized\nduality mapping, resolvents based on Bregman distances, and even resolvents\nbased on (nonsymmetric) rotators. As a by-product of recent work on the\nproximal average, we obtain a constructive Kirszbraun-Valentine extension\nresult for generalized firmly nonexpansive mappings.

However, in complete analogy to the annual\nparallax effect caused by the revolution of the Earth around the Sun, the\nmotion of the source star around the common barycentre with an orbiting planet\ncan also lead to observable deviations in microlensing light curves that can\nprovide evidence for the unseen companion.

Dropping GD 362 from the list of massive white\ndwarfs, there are no white dwarfs with M > 0.9 Msun that are known to host\ncircumstellar dust disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2008 21:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Ten years ago this summer,\nat the 1998 neutrino conference in Takayama, the Super-Kamiokande collaboration\nreported the observation of neutrinos changing flavor, thereby establishing the\nexistence of neutrino mass. A few years later, the SNO experiment solved the\nlong-standing solar neutrino problem demonstrating that it too was due to\nneutrino oscillation. Just a few years after that, these effects were confirmed\nand the oscillation parameters were measured with man-made neutrino sources.\nNow, just in this last year, the same neutrinos which were the source of the 30\nyear old solar neutrino problem were measured for the first time in a real-time\nexperiment.\n  In this talk, I will explain how a set of experiments, especially ones in the\nlast few years, have established a consistent framework of neutrino physics and\nalso explain some outstanding questions. Finally, I will cover how a set of\nupcoming experiments hope to address these questions in the coming decade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2008 14:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-23"}

The motivation of the\nstudy is the recently discovered, phonon-driven, magnetic relaxation in the\nSCGO compound [Mutka et al. PRL {\\bf 97} 047203 (2006)] pointing out the\nimportance of a low-energy ($\\hbar\\omega\\sim$7 meV) phonon mode. In neutron\nscattering experiments on these compounds the phonon signal is partly masked by\nthe magnetic signal from the Cr moments and we have therefore examined in\ndetail the non-magnetic isostructural counterparts SrGa$_{12}$O$_{19}$ (SGO)\nand Ba$_{2}$Sn$_{2}$ZnGa$_{10}$O$_{22}$ (BSZGO). Our {\\it ab-initio} lattice\ndynamics calculations on SGO reveal a peak in the vibrational density of states\nmatching with the neutron observations on SGO and SCGO. A strong contribution\nin the vibrational density of states comes from the partial contribution of the\nGa atoms on the 2b and 12k sites, involving modes at the M--point of the\nhexagonal system. These modes comprise dynamics of the kagom\\'e planes of the\npyrochlore slab magnetic sub-lattice, 12k sites, and therefore can drive\nmagnetic relaxation via spin-phonon coupling. Both BSZCGO and BSZGO show a\nsimilar low-energy Raman peak but no corresponding peak in the neutron\ndetermined density of states of BSZGO is seen. However, a strong non-Debye\nenhancement of low-energy phonon response is observed. We attribute this\nparticular feature to the Zn/Ga disorder on the 2$d$ -site, already evoked\nearlier to affect the magnetic properties of BSZCGO. We propose that this\ndisorder-induced phonon response explains the absence of a characteristic\nenergy scale and the much faster magnetic relaxation observed in BSZCGO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2008 00:06:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 10:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-19"}

This paper shows that conformal maps, under\nthe Floquet condition, leads to coincidence between exponential stretching or\nLyapunov exponent, conformal factor of fast dynamos. Unfolding conformal dynamo\nmaps can be obtained in Riemann-flat manifolds since here, Riemann curvature\nplays the role of folding. Previously, Oseledts [Geophys Astrophys Fluid Dyn\n\\textbf{73} (1993)] has shown that the number of twisted and untwisting orbits\nin a two torus on a compact Riemannian manifold induces a growth of fast dynamo\naction. In this paper, the stretching of conformal thin magnetic flux tubes is\nconstrained to vanish, in order to obtain the conformal factor for\nnon-stretching non-dynamos. Since thin flux tube can be considered as a twisted\nor untwisting two-torus map, it is shown that the untwisting, weakly torsion,\nand non-stretching conformal torus map cannot support a fast dynamo action, a\nmarginal dynamo being obtained. This is an example of an anti-fast dynamo\ntheorem besides the ones given by Vishik and Klapper and Young [Comm Math Phys\n\\textbf{173}(1996)] in ideally high conductive flow. From the Riemann curvature\ntensor it is shown that new conformal non-dynamo, is actually singular as one\napproaches the magnetic flux tube axis. Thus conformal map suppresses the\nstretching directions and twist, leading to the absence of fast dynamo action\nwhile Riemann-flat unfolding manifolds favors non-fast dynamos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2008 02:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-23"}

For fixed power density in the far field, what is the\ncost-optimum interstellar Beacon system? Experience shows an optimum tradeoff,\ndepending on transmission frequency and on antenna size and power. This emerges\nby minimizing the cost of producing a desired effective isotropic radiated\npower, which in turn determines the maximum range of detectability of a\ntransmitted signal. We derive general relations for cost-optimal aperture and\npower. For linear dependence of capital cost on transmitter power and antenna\narea, minimum capital cost occurs when the cost is equally divided between\nantenna gain and radiated power. For non-linear power law dependence a similar\nsimple division occurs. This is validated in cost data for many systems;\nindustry uses this cost optimum as a rule-of-thumb. Costs of pulsed\ncost-efficient transmitters are estimated from these relations using current\ncost parameters ($/W, $/m2) as a basis. Galactic-scale Beacons demand effective\nisotropic radiated power >1017 W, emitted powers are >1 GW, with antenna areas\n> km2. We show the scaling and give examples of such Beacons.

A separate section is devoted to reconstructions of strong solar\nenergetic-particle (SEP) events in the past, that suggest that the present-day\naverage SEP flux is broadly consistent with estimates on longer timescales, and\nthat the occurrence of extra-strong events is unlikely.

It is more and more difficult\nfor the customers to ensure a certain level of demand over a medium term\nhorizon as their own customers ask them for personalisation and fast\nadaptation. It is thus necessary to develop methods and decision support\nsystems to reconcile the order and book processes. In this context, this paper\nintends firstly to relate decision under uncertainty and the industrial point\nof view based on the notion of risk management. This serves as a basis for the\ndefinition of an approach based on simulation and decision theory that is\ndedicated to the design of cooperative processes in a customer-supplier\nrelationship. This approach includes the evaluation, in terms of risk, of\ndifferent cooperative processes using a simulation-dedicated tool. The\nevaluation process is based on an exploitation of decision theory concepts and\nmethods. The implementation of the approach is illustrated on an academic\nexample typical of the aeronautics supply chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2008 06:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-23"}

The campaign covered 48 nights, providing a temporal\nresolution of 0.36microHz with a detection threshold of about 0.2mmag in\nB-filter data.\n  Balloon 090100001 has the richest pulsation spectrum of any known pulsating\nsubdwarf B star and our analysis detected 114 frequencies including 97\nindependent and 17 combination ones.

For this, we\ncompare the radiative cooling time, t_cool, of relativistic electrons in the\nshock magnetic fields to the microscopic dynamical time of collisionless\nrelativistic shocks -- the inverse plasma frequency of protons, omega_pp^{-1}.\nWe obtain that for t_cool*omega_pp^{-1}\\lesssim ~few hundred, the electrons\ncool efficiently at or near the shock jump and are capable of emitiing away a\nlarge fraction of the shock energy. Such shocks are well-resolved in existing\nPIC simulations; therefore, the microscopic structure can be studied in detail.\nSince most of the emission in such shocks would be coming from the vicinity of\nthe shock, the spectral power of the emitted radiation can be directly obtained\nfrom finite-length simulations and compared with observational data. Such\nradiative shocks correspond to the internal baryon-dominated GRB shocks for the\nconventional range of ejecta parameters. Fermi acceleration of electrons in\nsuch shocks is limited by electron cooling, hence the emitted spectrum should\nbe lacking a non-thermal tail, whereas its peak likely falls in the multi-MeV\nrange. Incidentally, the conditions in internal shocks are almost identical to\nthose in laser-produced plasmas; thus, such GRB-like plasmas can be created and\nstudied in laboratory experiments using the presently available Petawatt-scale\nlaser facilities. An analysis of the external shocks shows that only the highly\nrelativistic shocks, corresponding to the extremely early afterglow phase, can\nhave efficient electron cooling in the shock transition. We emphasize the\nimportance of radiative PIC simulations for further studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2008 08:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

In this paper, we present an experimental and\ntheoretical study of transient osmotically driven flows through pipes with\nsemipermeable walls. We extend the experimental work of Eschrich, Evert and\nYoung \\cite[]{Eschrich:1972} by providing a more accurate version of their\nexperiment allowing for better comparison with theory. In the experiments we\nmeasure the dynamics and structure of a \"sugar front\", i.e. the transport and\ndecay of a sudden loading of sugar in a pipe which is closed in both ends. We\ninclude measurements of pressure inside the membrane tube allowing us to\ncompare the experiments directly with theory and, in particular, to confirm\nquantitatively the exponential decay of the front in a closed tube.In a novel\nsetup we are able to measure the entire concentration profile as the sugar\nfront moves. In contrast to previous studies we find very good agreement\nbetween experiment and theory.\n  In the limit of low axial resistance (valid in our experiments as well as in\nmany cases in plants) we show that the equations can be solved exactly by the\nmethod of characteristics yielding, in general, an implicit solution. Further\nwe show that under more general conditions the equations of motion can be\nrewritten as a single integro-differential equation, which can be readily\nsolved numerically. The applicability of our results to plants is discussed and\nit is shown that it is probable that the pressure-flow hypothesis can account\nfor short distance transport of sugar in plants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2008 09:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

We\nhave used Virtual Observatory tools to cross-match the IPHAS catalogue with the\n2MASS catalogue. We defined photometric criteria to identify Halpha emission\nsources with near-infrared colours similar to known young very low-mass stars\nand brown dwarfs. 4000 candidates were identified that met our criteria over an\narea of 1600 square degrees. We present low-resolution optical spectra of 113\ncandidates. Spectral types have been derived for the 33 candidates that have\nspectroscopically confirmed Halpha emission, negligible reddening and M\nspectral class. We have also measured Halpha emission and investigated the NaI\ndoublet (818.3 nm, 819.5 nm) in these 33 objects. We confirm that 33 IPHAS\ncandidates have strong Halpha indicative of disk accretion for their spectral\ntype. 23 of them have spectral class M4 or later, of which 10 have classes in\nthe range M5.5-M7.0 and thus could be very young brown dwarfs. Also many\nobjects have weak NaI doublet, an indication of low surface gravity.We conclude\nthat IPHAS provides a very valuable database to identify accreting very\nlow-mass stars and brown dwarfs, and that Virtual Observatory tools provide an\nefficient method for identifying these objects over large areas of the sky.\nBased on our success rate of 23 Halpha emission objects with spectral type in\nthe range M4-M7 out of 113 candidates with spectroscopic follow-up, we estimate\nthat there could be hundreds of such objects in the full IPHAS survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2008 12:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this way, the salient, deep-MOND\nresults--asymptotically flat rotation curves, the mass-rotational-speed\nrelation (baryonic Tully-Fisher relation), the Faber-Jackson relation,\netc.--follow from a symmetry principle.

Turbulence is expected to\narise in the disks that form planets, and these fluctuations act to compromise\nresonant configurations. This paper extends previous work by considering how\ninteractions between the planets and possible damping effects imposed by the\ndisk affect the outcomes. These physical processes are studied using three\napproaches: numerical integrations of the 3-body problem with additional\nforcing due to turbulence, model equations that reduce the problem to\nstochastically driven oscillators, and Fokker-Planck equations that describe\nthe time evolution of an ensemble of systems. With this combined approach, we\nelucidate the physics of how turbulence can remove extrasolar planetary systems\nfrom mean motion resonance. As expected, systems with sufficiently large\ndamping (dissipation) can maintain resonance, in spite of turbulent forcing. In\nthe absence of strong damping, ensembles of these systems exhibit two regimes\nof behavior, where the fraction of the bound states decreases as a power-law or\nas an exponential. Both types of behavior can be understood through the model\ndeveloped herein. For systems with weak interactions between planets, the model\nreduces to a stochastic pendulum, and the fraction of bound states decreases as\na power-law. For highly interactive systems, the dynamics are more complicated\nand the fraction of bound states decreases exponentially.

Our study is restricted to the Standard Model (SM).\n  At tree-level Higgs production in association with a b-quark pair proceeds\nthrough the small Yukawa bottom coupling in the Standard Model. Even in the\nlimit where this coupling vanishes, EW one-loop effects, through the top-Higgs\nYukawa coupling in particular, can still trigger this reaction. This\ncontribution is small for Higgs masses around 120GeV but it quickly picks up\nfor higher Higgs masses especially because the one-loop amplitude develops a\nleading Landau singularity and new thresholds open up. These effects can be\nviewed as the production of a pair of top quarks which rescatter to give rise\nto Higgs production through WW fusion. An important part of the thesis is\ndevoted to the topic of Landau singularities in one-loop Feynman diagrams and\napplication to the specific process of bbH production at the LHC.\n  Since the 4-point leading Landau singularity is not integrable when the\none-loop amplitude is squared, we regulate the cross section by taking into\naccount the width of the internal top and W particles. This requires that we\nextend the usual box one-loop function to the case of complex masses.
