We develop the counts-in-cells framework for the\nmulti-tracer approach, and use this to derive expressions for the full\nnon-Gaussian covariance matrix. We show, that for the usual auto-power\nstatistic, besides the off-diagonal covariance generated through gravitational\nmode-coupling, the discreteness of the tracers and their associated sampling\ndistribution can generate strong off-diagonal covariance, and that this becomes\nthe dominant source of covariance as k>>k_f=2 pi/L. On comparison with the\nderived expressions for the cross-power covariance, we show that the\noff-diagonal terms can be suppressed, if one cross-correlates a high\ntracer-density sample with a low one. Taking the effective estimator efficiency\nto be proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio (SN), we show that, to probe\nclustering as a function of physical properties of the sample, i.e. cluster\nmass or galaxy luminosity, then the cross-power approach can out perform the\nauto-power one by factors of a few. We confront the theory with measurements of\nthe mass-mass, halo-mass, and halo-halo power spectra from a large ensemble of\nN-body simulations. We show that there is a significant SN advantage to be\ngained from using the cross-power approach when studying the bias of rare\nhaloes. The analysis is repeated in configuration space and again SN\nimprovement is found. We estimate the covariance matrix for these samples, and\nfind strong off-diagonal contributions. The covariance depends on halo mass,\nwith higher mass samples having stronger covariance. In agreement with theory,\nwe show that the covariance is suppressed for the cross-power.

We first consider\ntransit time variation (TTV), where we update the model to include the effects\nof orbital eccentricity. We draw two key conclusions: 1) In order to maintain\nHill stability, the orbital frequency of the exomoon will always be higher than\nthe sampling frequency. Therefore, the period of the exomoon cannot be reliably\ndetermined from TTV, only a set of harmonic frequencies. 2) The TTV amplitude\nis proportional to M_S a_S where M_S is the exomoon mass and a_S is the\nsemi-major axis of the moon's orbit. Therefore, M_S and a_S cannot be\nseparately determined. We go on to predict a new observable due to exomoons -\ntransit duration variation (TDV). We derive the TDV amplitude and conclude that\nits amplitude is not only detectable, but the TDV signal will provide two\nrobust advantages: 1) The TDV amplitude is proportional to M_S a_S^{-1/2} and\ntherefore the ratio of TTV and TDV allows for a separate determination of M_S\nand a_S. 2) TDV has a 90 degrees phase difference to the TTV signal, making it\nan excellent complementary technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 16:20:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2009 15:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

At the present time, the ecliptic plane is almost\nperpendicular to the galactic plane, consistent with this modification of the\nNewtonian gravitational force.

In\nthese experiments, a change in the extent of the bead's random motion is used\nas a reporter of the underlying macromolecular dynamics and is often deemed\nsufficient for TPM analysis. However, a complete understanding of how the\nmotion depends on the physical properties of the tethered particle complex\nwould permit more quantitative and accurate evaluation of TPM data. For\ninstance, such understanding can help extract details about a looped complex\ngeometry (or multiple coexisting geometries) from TPM data.

By applying these\nequations to the simple but reasonable model of multi-field chaotic inflation,\nwe explicitly show that the total curvature perturbation is continuously\nvarying because of the non-adiabatic components of the curvature perturbation\ngenerated by the multiple inflaton fields throughout the whole evolution of the\nuniverse. We also provide an useful analytic estimation of the total as well as\nmatter and radiation curvature perturbations, assuming that matter is\ncompletely decoupled from radiation from the beginning. The resulting\nisocurvature perturbation between matter and radiation is at most sub-percent\nlevel when the masses of the inflaton fields are distributed between\n$10^{-6}m_{pl}$ and $10^{-5}m_{pl}$. We find that this result is robust unless\nwe use non-trivial decay rates, and that thus, in general, it is hard to obtain\nlarge matter-radiation isocurvature perturbation. Also, by using the\n$\\delta{N}$ formalism, we point out that the inflationary calculation,\nespecially when involving multiple inflaton fields, is likely to lose the\npotentially important post-inflationary evolution which can modify the\nresulting curvature perturbation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 20:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2009 22:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-27"}

We use the\nsemi-analytic galaxy formation model of Bower et al. implemented in the\nMillennium simulation. We apply our method to the specific case of the surveys\nsoon to commence with PS1, the first of 4 telescopes planned for the Pan-STARRS\nsystem. PS1 has 5 photometric bands (grizy), and will carry out an all-sky 3pi\nsurvey and a medium deep survey (MDS) over 84 sq.deg. We calculate the expected\nmagnitude limits for extended sources in the two surveys. We find that, after 3\nyears, the 3pi survey will have detected over 10^8 galaxies in all 5 bands, 10\nmillion of which will lie at redshift z>0.9, while the MDS will have detected\nover 10^7 galaxies with 0.5 million lying at z>2. These numbers at least double\nif detection in the shallowest band, y is not required. We then evaluate the\naccuracy of photometric redshifts estimated using an off-the-shelf photo-z\ncode. With the grizy bands alone it is possible to achieve an accuracy in the\n3pi survey of Delta z/(1+z)~0.06 for 0.25<z<0.8, which could be reduced by\nabout 15% using near infrared photometry from the UKIDDS survey, but would\nincrease by about 25% for the deeper sample without the y band photometry. For\nthe MDS an accuracy of Delta z/(1+z)~0.05 is achievable for 0.02<z<1.5 using\ngrizy. A dramatic improvement in accuracy is possible by selecting only red\ngalaxies. In this case, Delta z/(1+z)~0.02-0.04 is achievable for ~100 million\ngalaxies at 0.4<z<1.1 in the 3pi survey and for 30 million galaxies in the MDS\nat 0.4<z<2.

Spiral galaxies in our sample have observed integrated\nfractional polarization in the range < 1% to 17.6%. At inclinations less than\n50 degrees, the fractional polarization depends mostly on the ratio of random\nto regular magnetic field strength. At higher inclinations, Faraday\ndepolarization associated with the regular magnetic field becomes more\nimportant. The observed degree of polarization is lower (<4%) for more luminous\ngalaxies, in particular those with L_{4.8} > 2 x 10^{21} W/Hz. The polarization\nangle of the integrated emission is aligned with the apparent minor axis of the\ndisk for galaxies without a bar. In our axially symmetric models, the\npolarization angle of the integrated emission is independent of wavelength.\nSimulated distributions of fractional polarization for randomly oriented spiral\ngalaxies at 4.8 GHz and 1.4 GHz are presented. We conclude that polarization\nmeasurements, e.g. with the SKA, of unresolved spiral galaxies allow\nstatistical studies of the magnetic field in disk galaxies using large samples\nin the local universe and at high redshift. As these galaxies behave as\nidealized background sources without internal Faraday rotation, they can be\nused to detect large-scale magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 20:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The theory of entanglement\nestablishes basic laws, such as the non-increase of entanglement under local\noperations, that govern its manipulation and aims to draw from them formal\nanalogies to the second law of thermodynamics. However, while in the second law\nthe entropy uniquely determines whether a state is adiabatically accessible\nfrom another, the manipulation of entanglement under local operations exhibits\na fundamental irreversibility which prevents the existence of such an order.\n  Here we show that a reversible theory of entanglement and a rigorous\nrelationship with thermodynamics may be established when one considers all\nnon-entangling transformations. The role of the entropy in the second law is\ntaken by the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement in the basic law of\nentanglement. We show the usefulness of this new approach to general resource\ntheories and to quantum information theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2008 11:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-04"}

It is\nshown that the primary driver for the development team is the science that can\nbe done with the models, and that they constantly strive to include the best\npossible physical data. A few preliminary comparisons of M star model spectra\nto spectrophotometric observations are presented. Particular results related to\nopacity effects are discussed. The size of errors in the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) and model thermal stratification are estimated for different\ndensities of the wavelength sampling. The number of points used in the MARCS\n2008 grid (108000) is large enough to ensure errors of only a few K in all\nmodels of the grid, except the optically very thin layers of metal-poor stars.\nErrors in SEDs may reach about 10% locally in the UV. The published sampled\nSEDs are thus appropriate to compute synthetic broad-band photometry, but\nhigher resolution spectra will be computed in the near future and published as\nwell on the MARCS site (marcs.astro.uu.se). Test model calculations with TiO\nline opacity accounted for in scattering show an important cooling of the upper\natmospheric layers of red giants. Rough estimates of radiative and collisional\ntime scales for electronic transitions of TiO indicate that scattering may well\nbe the dominant mechanism in these lines. However models constructed with this\nhypothesis are incompatible with optical observations of TiO (Arcturus) or IR\nobservations of OH (Betelgeuse), although they may succeed in explaining H2O\nline observations. More work is needed in that direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2008 07:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is known that invariance under these\ntranslations implies the energy-momentum conservation relation that is usually\nassumed to hold globally. Transformations of the current under these\ntranslations, which lead to this result, also imply constraints that have been\nignored so far in relativistic quantum mechanic approaches.

The measurements\nreveal that the H-T phase diagram of GGG is much more complicated than\npreviously assumed. The application of an external field at low T results in an\nintensity change for most of the magnetic peaks which can be divided into three\ndistinct sets: ferromagnetic, commensurate antiferromagnetic, and\nincommensurate antiferromagnetic. The ferromagnetic peaks (e.g. (112), (440)\nand (220)) have intensities that increase with the field and saturate at high\nfield. The antiferromagnetic reflections have intensities that grow in low\nfields, reach a maximum at an intermediate field (apart from the (002) peak\nwhich shows two local maxima) and then decrease and disappear above 2 T. These\nAFM peaks appear, disappear and reach maxima in different fields.

In the case of significant transparency the velocity of a given step\nin a given moment is affected by detachment of atoms from rather distant steps\nin rather earlier moments. The reason is that the adatom needs time to cross\nmany steps before attaching to a kink position. The theory of the\ncrystallization should account for the time dependence of the adatom\nconcentrations on the terraces. Such a transient growth model is developed here\nfor the limit of slow kinetics at the steps and fast surface diffusion. The\nmodel accounts for the non-local electromigration of the adatoms. The central\nresults of this study are: - The vicinal surface with transparent steps is\nunstable when the drift velocity of the adatoms multiplied with the relative\ndeviation of the adatom concentration from equilibrium is larger than the\ncritical velocity of the steps. - The most unstable mode has a wavelength\n(expressed as a number of terraces) which is independent of the surface\norientation (the miscut angle of the vicinal) as well as on the magnitude of\nstep repulsion and the electromigration force and depends only on the relative\ntransparency of the steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2008 11:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-15"}

The\nefficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined\nwith further processing can operate at frame rate.\n  Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic\nfor feature detection, and using machine learning we derive a feature detector\nfrom this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5% of the\navailable processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even\noperate at frame rate (Harris detector 115%, SIFT 195%).

Further understanding of these\nscenarios requires detailed numerical modelling, but fully relativistic kinetic\ncodes are computationally intensive, and the goal of one-to-one direct\nmodelling of such scenarios and direct comparison with experimental results is\nstill difficult to achieve. In this paper we discuss the issues involved in\nperforming kinetic plasma simulations of experiments and astrophysical\nscenarios, focusing on what needs to be achieved for one-to-one direct\nmodeling, and the computational requirements involved. We focus on code\nefficiency and new algorithms, specifically on parallel scalability issues,\nnamely on dynamic load balancing, and on high-order interpolation and boosted\nframe simulations to optimize simulation performance. We also discuss the new\nvisualization and data mining tools required for these numerical experiments\nand recent simulation work illustrating these techniques is also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2008 14:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
