Such discs\nshould arise frequently, but should be observed infrequently, precisely because\nthey fragment rapidly. By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star. Binaries form by pairing of the\nnewly-formed stars in the disc, giving a low-mass binary fraction of ~0.16.\nThese binaries include close and wide BD/BD binaries and BD/PM binaries. BDs\nthat remain as companions to Sun-like stars are more likely to be in BD/BD\nbinaries than are BDs ejected into the field. Disc fragmentation is a robust\nmechanism; even if only a small fraction of Sun-like stars host the required\nmassive extended discs,this mechanism can produce all the PM stars observed,\nmost of the BD stars, and a significant proportion of the very low-mass HB\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2008 16:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Recently, the\npossibility to reduce the diffusion noise in semiconductor bulk materials by\nadding a random fluctuating contribution to the driving static electric field\nhas been tested. The present work extends the previous theories by considering\nthe noise-induced effects on the electron transport dynamics in low-doped\nn-type GaAs samples driven by a high-frequency periodic electric field\n(cyclostationary conditions). By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate\nthe changes in the spectral density of the electron velocity fluctuations\ncaused by the addition of an external correlated noise source. The results\nreported in this paper confirm that, under specific conditions, the presence of\na fluctuating component added to an oscillating electric field can reduce the\ntotal noise power. Furthermore, we find a nonlinear behaviour of the spectral\ndensity with the noise intensity. Our study reveals that, critically depending\non the external noise correlation time, the dynamical response of electrons\ndriven by a periodic electric field receives a benefit by the constructive\ninterplay between the fluctuating field and the intrinsic noise of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2008 17:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The cause of the extra-mixing has\nbeen attributed to thermohaline convection that should take place after the RGB\nbump for low-mass stars and on the early-AGB for more massive objects. To track\nthe occurrence of this process over a wide mass range, we derive in a\nhomogeneous way the abundances of C, N, O, and Na, as well as the 12C/13C ratio\nin a sample of 31 giants of 10 open clusters with turn-off masses from 1.7 to\n3.1 Msun.

The quantitative deficits of\nthe pair potential predictions can be traced back (i) to the fact that the pair\npotentials are unable in principle to model the elastic anisotropy of cubic\ncrystals; (ii) as the major drawback of pair potentials we identify the gross\nunderestimation of the stable stacking fault energy.

We show that this common\nmass scale can be explained within the Cold Dark Matter scenario when the\nphysics of galaxy formation is taken into account. The narrow range of M03\ncomes from the narrow distribution of circular velocities at time of accretion\n(peaking around 20 km/s) for satellites able to form stars and the not tight\ncorrelation between halo concentration and circular velocity. The wide range of\nsatellite luminosities is due to a combination of the mass at time of accretion\nand the broad distribution of accretion redshifts for a given mass. This causes\nthe satellites baryonic content to be suppressed by photo-ionization to very\ndifferent extents.

A long standing puzzle has\nbeen the extreme enrichments of 3He ions. The most extreme enrichments are\nobserved in low fluence, the so-called impulsive, events which are believed to\nbe produced at the flare site in the solar corona with little scattering and\nacceleration during transport to the Earth. In two earlier papers (Liu et al.\n2004 and 2006) we showed how such extreme enrichments can result in the model\ndeveloped by Petrosian and Liu (2004), where ions are accelerated\nstochastically by plasma waves or turbulence. In this paper we address the\nrelative distributions of the fluences of 3He and 4He ions presented by Ho et\nal. (2005) which show that while the distribution of 4He fluence like many\nother extensive characteristics of solar flare, is fairly broad, the 3He\nfluence is limited to a narrow range. Moreover, the ratio of the fluences shows\na strong correlation with the 4He fluence. One of the predictions of our model\nwas presence of steep variation of the fluence ratio with the level of\nturbulence or the rate of acceleration. We show here that this feature of the\nmodel can reproduce the observed distribution of the fluences with very few\nfree parameters. The primary reason for the success of the model in both fronts\nis because fully ionized 3He ion, with its unique charge to mass ratio, can\nresonantly interact with more plasma modes and accelerate more readily than\n4He. Essentially in most flares, all background 3He ions are accelerated to few\nMeV/nucleon range, while this happens for 4He ions only in very strong events.\nA much smaller fraction of 4He ions reach such energies in weaker events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2008 20:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-24"}

We assume that nodes intend to communicate\nperiodically, or according to some time-based schedule. Clearly, perfectly\nsynchronized devices could switch their radios on for exactly the minimum\nperiods required by their joint schedules. The main challenge in the deployment\nof wireless networks is to synchronize the devices' schedules, given that their\ninitial schedules may be offset relative to one another (even if their clocks\nrun at the same speed). We significantly improve previous results, and show\noptimal use of the radio for two processors and near-optimal use of the radio\nfor synchronization of an arbitrary number of processors. In particular, for\ntwo processors we prove deterministically matching $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$ upper and\nlower bounds on the number of times the radio has to be on, where $n$ is the\ndiscretized uncertainty period of the clock shift between the two processors.\n(In contrast, all previous results for two processors are randomized.) For\n$m=n^\\beta$ processors (for any $\\beta < 1$) we prove $\\Omega(n^{(1-\\beta)/2})$\nis the lower bound on the number of times the radio has to be switched on (per\nprocessor), and show a nearly matching (in terms of the radio use)\n$\\~{O}(n^{(1-\\beta)/2})$ randomized upper bound per processor, with failure\nprobability exponentially close to 0. For $\\beta \\geq 1$ our algorithm runs\nwith at most $poly-log(n)$ radio invocations per processor. Our bounds also\nhold in a radio-broadcast model where interference must be taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2008 20:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 22:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-15"}

The SMC\nCepheids are bluer in (B-V) at a given period than for both the Galaxy and the\nLMC. Their P-C relation in (B-V) is best fit by two lines intersecting at P=10\nd. Their break must necessarily exist also in the P-L relations in B and/or V,\nbut remains hidden in the magnitude scatter. An additional pronounced break of\nthe P-L relations in B, V, and I occurs at P=2.5 d. The observed slope of the\nlines of constant period in the HR diagram agrees with the theoretical\nexpectation from the pulsation equation. The largest amplitude Cepheids for\nperiods less than 13 days occur near the blue edge of the instability strip.\nThe sense is reversed in the period interval from 13 to 20 days, as in the\nGalaxy and the LMC.

Failure to take into\naccount the slope differences in the P-L relation as a function of metallicity\nusing Cepheids as distance indicators results in incorrect Cepheid distances.\nPart of the 15% difference between our long distance scale - now independently\nsupported by TRGB distances - and that of the HST Key Project short scale is\ndue to the effect of using an inappropriate P-L relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2008 23:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Most importantly, we show\nthat our approach allows one to treat, within a unified framework, both those\nregions of the flow which are fluid-pressure dominated (such as in the interior\nof compact objects) and those which are instead magnetic-pressure dominated\n(such as in their magnetospheres)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2008 09:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-09"}

Here we\npresent high energy spectra of all 22 cataclysmic variables detected in the 3rd\nIBIS survey and provide the first average spectrum over the 20-100 keV band for\nthis class. Our analysis indicates that the best-fit model is a thermal\nbremsstrahlung with an average temperature of <kT> ~22 keV. Recently, eleven\n(ten intermediate polars and one polar) of these systems have been followed-up\nby Swift/XRT (operating in the 0.3-10 keV energy band), thus allowing us to\ninvestigate their spectral behaviour over the range ~0.3-100 keV. Thanks to\nthis wide energy coverage, it was possible for these sources to simultaneously\nmeasure the soft and hard components and estimate their temperatures. The soft\nemission, thought to originate in the irradiated poles of the white dwarf\natmosphere, is well described by a blackbody model with temperatures in the\nrange ~60-120 eV. The hard emission, which is supposed to be originated from\noptically thin plasma in the post-shock region above the magnetic poles, is\nindeed well modelled with a bremsstrahlung model with temperatures in the range\n~16-33 keV, similar to the values obtained from the INTEGRAL data alone.

The high degree of deuteration observed in some prestellar cores\ndepends on the ortho-to-para H2 ratio through the H3+ fractionation. Aims. We\nwant to constrain the ortho/para H2 ratio across the L183 prestellar core. This\nis mandatory to correctly describe the deuter- ation amplification phenomenon\nin depleted cores such as L183 and to relate the total (ortho+para) H2D+\nabundance to the sole ortho-H2D+ column density measurement. Methods. To\nconstrain this ortho/para H2 ratio and derive its profile, we make use of the\nN2D+ /N2H+ ratio and of the ortho-H2D+ observations performed across the\nprestellar core. We use two simple chemical models limited to an almost totally\ndepleted core description. New dissociative recombination and trihydrogen\ncation-dihydrogen reaction rates (including all isotopologues) are presented in\nthis paper and included in our models. Results. We estimate the H2D+ ortho/para\nratio in the L183 cloud, and constrain the H2 ortho/para ratio : we show that\nit is varying across the prestellar core by at least an order of magnitude\nbeing still very high (~0.1) in most of the cloud. Our time-dependent model\nindicates that the prestellar core is presumably older than 1.5-2 x 10^5 years\nbut that it may not be much older. We also show that it has reached its present\ndensity only recently and that its contraction from a uniform density cloud can\nbe constrained. Conclusions. A proper understanding of deuteration chemistry\ncannot be attained without taking into account the whole ortho/para family of\nmolecular hydrogen and trihydrogen cation isotopologues as their relations are\nof utmost importance in the global scheme. Tracing the ortho/para H2 ratio\nshould also give useful constraints on the dynamical evolution of prestellar\ncores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2008 12:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 09:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

It has been proposed that this occurs when effective\nmetal line cooling occurs at a metallicity threshold of Z/Z_sun > 10^{-3.5}. We\nstudy the influence of low levels of metal enrichment on the cooling and\ncollapse of initially ionized gas in small protogalactic halos using\nthree-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with particle\nsplitting. Our initial conditions represent protogalaxies forming within a\npreviously ionized H ii region that has not yet had time to cool and recombine.\nThese differ considerably from those used in simulations predicting a\nmetallicity threshold, where the gas was initially cold and only partially\nionized. In the centrally condensed potential that we study here, a wide\nvariety of initial conditions for the gas yield a monolithic central collapse.\nOur models show no fragmentation during collapse to number densities as high as\n10^5 cm^{-3}, for metallicities reaching as high as 10^{-1} Z_sun in one\nrotating case, far above the threshold suggested by previous work. Rotation\nallows for the formation of gravitationally stable gas disks over large\nfractions of the local Hubble time. Turbulence slows the growth of the central\ndensity slightly, but both spherically symmetric and turbulent initial\nconditions collapse and form a single sink particle.

This frame-independent light-front wave equation is\nequivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of\nspin-$J$ modes on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. Light-front holography is a\nremarkable feature of AdS/CFT: it allows hadronic amplitudes in the AdS fifth\ndimension to be mapped to frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of\nhadrons in physical space-time, thus providing a relativistic description of\nhadrons at the amplitude level. In principle, the model can be systematically\nimproved by diagonalizing the full QCD light-front Hamiltonian on the AdS/QCD\nbasis.

For 3-dimensional clustering statistics, we find\nthat none of the internal error methods investigated are able to reproduce\nneither accurately nor robustly the errors of external estimators on 1 to 25\nMpc/h scales. The standard bootstrap overestimates the variance of xi(s) by\n~40% on all scales probed, but recovers, in a robust fashion, the principal\neigenvectors of the underlying covariance matrix. The jackknife returns the\ncorrect variance on large scales, but significantly overestimates it on smaller\nscales.

However,\nthis is a challenging target: in conventional metals the high electron density\nrestricts interface effects such as carrier depletion/accumulation to a region\nmuch narrower than the coherence length, the scale necessary for\nsuperconductivity to occur. In contrast, in copper oxides the carrier density\nis low while the critical temperature (T_c) is high and the coherence length\nvery short; so, this provides a breakthrough opportunity but at a price: the\ninterface must be atomically perfect. Here we report on superconductivity in\nbilayers consisting of an insulator (La_2CuO_4) and a metal\n(La_{1.55}Sr_{0.45}CuO_{4}), neither of which is superconducting in isolation.\nHowever, in bilayers T_c is either ~15 K or ~30 K, depending on the layering\nsequence.

Most clusters do not\nhave significant detections at 70 microns; one cluster, NGC 6341, has tentative\nevidence for the presence of dust, but 90 micron observations do not confirm\nthe detection. Individual 70 micron point sources which appear in several of\nthe cluster images are likely to be background galaxies.

A prime application of characteristic evolution is\nto extend such simulations to null infinity where the waveform from the binary\ninspiral and merger can be unambiguously computed. This has now been\naccomplished by Cauchy-characteristic extraction, where data for the\ncharacteristic evolution is supplied by Cauchy data on an extraction worldtube\ninside the artificial outer boundary. The ultimate application of\ncharacteristic evolution is to eliminate the role of this outer boundary by\nconstructing a global solution via Cauchy-characteristic matching.
