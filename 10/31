It is shown that our new 1D B/D\ndecompositions yield disk structural parameters that differ only slightly from\nthe basic fits of Tully et al. and evidence for structural bimodality of UMa\ngalaxies is maintained.

In the environments where\nthese transitions are optically thick, deexcitation occurs through higher\nseries lines, so that the flux in these lines has a fluorescent contribution in\naddition to recombination; in particular, Balmer emissivities are\nsystematically enhanced above case B. The effectiveness of such mechanism in\nHII regions and the adequacy of photoionization models as a tool to study it\nare the two main focuses of this work. We find that photoionization models of H\nII regions illuminated by low-resolution population synthesis models\nsignificantly overpredict the fluorescent contribution to the Balmer lines.\nConversely, photoionization models in which the non-ionizing part of the\ncontinuum is omitted or is not transferred underpredict the fluorescent\ncontribution to the Balmer lines, producing a bias of similar amplitude in the\nopposite direction. In this paper, we carry out realistic estimations of the\nfluorescent Balmer intensity and discuss the variations to be expected as the\nsimulated observational setup and the stellar population's parameters are\nvaried. In all the cases explored, we find that fluorescent excitation provides\na significant contribution. We also show that differential fluorescent\nenhancement may produce line-of-sight differences in the Balmer decrement,\nmimicking interstellar extinction. Fluorescent excitation emerges from our\nstudy as a small but important mechanism for the enhancement of Balmer lines,\nwhich should be taken into account in the abundance analysis of photoionized\nregions, particularly in the case of high-precision applications such as the\ndetermination of primordial helium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2008 20:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We find that the HIEA\nand HISA methods can resolve the distance ambiguity for 72% and 87% of our\nsample, respectively. When projected onto the Galactic plane, this large sample\nappears to reveal aspects of Galactic structure, with spiral arm-like features\nat Galactocentric radii of 4.5 and 6 kpc, and a lack of HII regions within 3.5\nkpc of the Galactic center. Our HII regions are approximately in the ratio of 2\nto 1 for far verses near distances. The ratio of far to near distances for\nultra-compact HII regions is 2.2 to 1.

Diffuse\nHII regions are preferentially at the far distance; their ratio of far to near\ndistances is 3.8 to 1. This implies that the distinction between ultra compact\nand compact HII regions is due largely to distance, and that the large angular\nsize of diffuse HII regions is not due solely to proximity to the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2008 20:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

We derive analytic formulas for its endpoint MT2{max}(n,p,c) as a\nfunction of the unknown test mass Mc of the final particle in the subchain and\nthe transverse momentum pT due to radiation from the initial state.

We prove that the subsystem\nMT2(n,p,c) variables by themselves already yield a sufficient number of\nmeasurements for a complete determination of the mass spectrum (including the\noverall mass scale). As an illustration, we consider the simple case of a decay\nchain with up to three heavy particles, X2 -> X1 -> X0, which is rather\nproblematic for all other mass measurement methods. We propose three different\nMT2-based methods, each of which allows a complete determination of the masses\nof particles X0, X1 and X2.

The derivation of the equilibrium equations allows the\nextension of the well-known Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) isotherm to more\ncomplex systems. The formalism reproduces the classical theory for monomers,\nleads to the exact statistical thermodynamics of interacting k-mers adsorbed in\none dimension, and provides a close approximation for two-dimensional systems\naccounting multisite occupancy and lateral interactions in the first layer.\nComparisons between analytical data and Monte Carlo simulations were performed\nin order to test the validity of the theoretical model. The study showed that:\n(i) the resulting thermodynamic description obtained from QCA is significantly\nbetter than that obtained from BWA and still mathematically handable; (ii) for\nnon-interacting k-mers, the BET equation leads to an underestimate of the true\nmonolayer volume; (iii) attractive lateral interactions compensate the effect\nof the multisite occupancy and the monolayer volume predicted by BET equation\nagrees very well with the corresponding true value; and (iv) repulsive\ncouplings between the admolecules hamper the formation of the monolayer and the\nBET results are not good (even worse than those obtained in the non-interacting\ncase).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2008 23:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is known that there are\nquadratic extensions of K that parametrize C.

It is possible that the\nwitness variety is not a hypercircle for the given extension, but for an\nalternative one.\n  We use these two facts to present an algorithm to solve the following optimal\nreparametrization problem.

These observations were obtained with OSIRIS using the Keck Laser\nGuide Star Adaptive Optics system. All sources have a compact spatial extent of\n~1\", with an average half light radius of r=2.9 kpc and average dereddened star\nformation rate of 22 Msolar per year. Based on H-alpha kinematics we find that\nthese six galaxies are dynamically distinguishable, and we classify them as\neither merger or disk candidate systems. We find three merger systems\n(HDF-BX1287, HDF-BX1315, and Q1623-BX491) with varying geometries and dynamical\nproperties. Three galaxies (HDF-BMZ1299, Q2343-BX344, and Q2343-BM145) are\nwell-fit by an inclined-disk model with low velocity residuals (20 to 46\nkm/sec). An average plateau velocity of v_p=185 km/sec is achieved within 1.0\nkpc. The majority of observed velocity dispersions (~88 km/sec) can be\nexplained by the residual seeing halo, and are not intrinsic to our sources.\nHowever, one merger and one disk candidate have high velocity dispersions (>\n200 km/sec) that cannot be solely explained by beam smearing. For two disk\ncandidates, we detect [NII] emission and are able to map the [NII]/H-alpha\nratio on kiloparsec scales. In both cases, [NII] emission is more concentrated\nthan H-alpha emission (< 0.2\"), and peak ratios are best explained by the\npresence of an AGN. These are among the weakest known AGN at high redshift,\nhowever their emission is strong enough to impact high redshift metallicity\nstudies that use nebular ratios.

It is shown that, even for the unified\ntreatment of quantum transport and quantum diffusion in homogeneous systems,\nall quasi-momenta of the carrier distribution function are present and fulfill\ntheir specific function.

In this archipelago, pine forest is a mosaic of natural\nstands (remnants of past forest overexploitation) and artificial stands planted\nfrom the 1940's. The genetic makeup of the artificially regenerated forest is\nof some concern. The use of reproductive material with uncontrolled origin or\nfrom a reduced number of parental trees may produce stands ill adapted to local\nconditions or unable to adapt in response to environmental change. The genetic\ndiversity within a transect of reforested stands connecting two natural forest\nfragments has been studied with nuclear and chloroplast microsatellites. Little\ngenetic differentiation and similar levels of genetic diversity to the\nsurrounding natural stands were found for nuclear markers. However, chloroplast\nmicrosatellites presented lower haplotype diversity in reforested stands, and\nthis may be a consequence of the lower effective population size of the\nchloroplast genome, meaning chloroplast markers have a higher sensitivity to\nbottlenecks. Understory natural regeneration within the reforestation was also\nanalysed to study gene flow from natural forest into artificial stands.\nEstimates of immigration rate into artificially regenerated forest were high\n(0.68-0.75), producing a significant increase of genetic diversity (both in\nchloroplast and nuclear microsatellites), which indicates the capacity for\ngenetic recovery for P. canariensis reforestations surrounded by larger natural\nstands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 13:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-03"}

This paper presents the manufacturing and tests of a\nmicrodots apodizer optimized for the near IR.\n  The intent of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of\nbinary apodizers for the APLC. This study is also relevant for any coronagraph\nusing amplitude pupil apodization.\n  A binary apodizer has been designed using a halftone dot process, where the\nbinary array of pixels with either 0% or 100% transmission is calculated to fit\nthe required continuous transmission, i.e. local transmission control is\nobtained by varying the relative density of the opaque and transparent pixels.\nAn error diffusion algorithm was used to optimize the distribution of pixels\nthat best approximates the required field transmission. The prototype was\ntested with a coronagraphic setup in the near IR.\n  The transmission profile of the prototype agrees with the theoretical shape\nwithin 3% and is achromatic. The observed apodized and coronagraphic images are\nconsistent with theory. However, binary apodizers introduce high frequency\nnoise that is a function of the pixel size. Numerical simulations were used to\nspecify pixel size in order to minimize this effect, and validated by\nexperiment.\n  This paper demonstrates that binary apodizers are well suited for being used\nin high contrast imaging coronagraphs. The correct choice of pixel size is\nimportant and must be adressed considering the scientific field of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 15:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We compare the results\nwith those for Rb_2 in order to understand the characteristic differences\nbetween heteronuclear and homonuclear molecules. The major differences arise\nfrom the different long-range potential for excited states. Ultracold 85Rb and\n133Cs atoms colliding on the X^1Sigma+ potential curve are initially\nphotoassociated to form excited RbCs molecules in the region below the Rb(5S) +\nCs(6P_1/2) asymptote. We explore the nature of the Omega=0^+ levels in this\nregion, which have mixed A^1Sigma^+ and b^3Pi character. We then study the\nquantum dynamics of RbCs by a time-dependent wavepacket (TDWP) approach. A\nwavepacket is formed by exciting a few vibronic levels and is allowed to\npropagate on the coupled electronic potential energy curves. For a detuning of\n7.5 cm-1, the wavepacket for RbCs reaches the short-range region in about 13\nps, which is significantly faster than for the homonuclear Rb_2 system; this is\nmostly because of the absence of an R^-3 long-range tail in the excited-state\npotential curves for heteronuclear systems. We give a simple semiclassical\nformula that relates the time taken to the long-range potential parameters. For\nRbCs, in contrast to Rb_2, the excited-state wavepacket shows a substantial\npeak in singlet density near the inner turning point, and this produces a\nsignificant probability of deexcitation to form ground-state molecules bound by\nup to 1500 cm-1. Our analysis of the role of spin-orbit coupling concerns the\ncharacter of the mixed states in general and is important for both\nphotoassociation and stimulated Raman deexcitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 15:02:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2009 08:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-16"}

For instance, we may\napply it to the \"Z(2)-sequences\" previously considered by Harcharras. The\nresult appears to be new in that case.

Eigenvector 2 is related to\nhost galaxy (relative to the observed AGN) emission and eigenvectors 3 and 4\ndistinguish between two sources of obscuration: host galaxy absorption and\ncircumnuclear absorption. Although our analysis is consistent with unification\nschemes where inclination dependent obscuration is important in determining the\nAGN SEDs, the L/Ledd ratio is the most important factor, followed by host\ngalaxy emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 15:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This ensemble, which is based on the conservation\nproperties of the stress tensor, is distinct from the original Edwards ensemble\nand applies to packings of deformable grains.

Varying the Fermi energy of a\nCNT and the relative strength of couplings to two ferromagnetic (FM)\nelectrodes, we studied the conductance as well as the magnetoresistance (MR).\nDue to resonant transport through discrete energy levels in a finite CNT, the\nconductance and MR are oscillating as a function of the CNT Fermi energy. The\nMR is peaked at the conductance valleys and dipped close to the conductance\npeaks. When couplings to two FM electrodes are asymmetric, the MR dips become\nnegative under a rather strong asymmetry.

The source evolves\nfrom a low/hard state (LHS) toward a high/soft state (HSS). In all states the\nemergent photon spectrum is described by the sum of Comptonization and soft\n(disk) blackbody components. In the LHS, the Comptonization component dominates\nin the resulting spectrum. On the other hand, during the HSS the soft (disk)\ncomponent is already dominant. In this state the Comptonization part of the\nspectrum is much softer than that in the LHS (photon index is ~ 2.4 in the HSS\nvs. that is ~1.7 in the LHS). In the BeppoSAX data we find a strong signature\nof the index saturation with the mass accretion rate which can be considered as\nan observational evidence of the converging flow (black hole) in XTE J1650-500.\nWe derive power spectra (PS) of the source time variability in different\nspectral states as a function of energy band. When the source undergoes a\ntransition to softer states, the PS as a whole is shifted to higher frequencies\nwhich can be interpreted as a contraction of the Compton cloud during hard-soft\nspectral evolution. It is worthwhile to emphasize a detection of a strong\nlow-frequency red noise component in the HSS PS which can be considered a\nsignature of the presence of the strong extended disk in the HSS. Also as a\nresult of our data analysis, we find a very weak sign of K_alpha line\nappearance in these BeppoSAX data. This finding does not confirm previous\nclaims by Miniutti et al. on the presence of a broad and strongly relativistic\niron emission line in this particular set of the BeppoSAX data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 15:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
