We consider two cases.\nIn the first case, we assume that power control is possible and channel\nstatistics are known. In this case, we show that the optimal policies can be\nobtained greedily by maximizing a linear utility function at each channel\nstate. In the second case, we assume that power control is not possible and\nchannel statistics are not available. In this case, we define a greedy rate\nallocation policy and provide upper bounds on the performance difference\nbetween the optimal and the greedy policy. Our bounds highlight the dependence\nof the performance difference on the channel variations and the structure of\nthe utility function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2008 18:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-08"}

Assuming a standard\nIMF and simple chemical evolution model scaled to match the present-day cluster\nearly-type SN Ia rate, the stars in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) plus the\nintracluster stars (ICS) generate 31^{+11}_{-9}%, on average, of the observed\nICM Fe within r_{500} (~ 0.6 times r_{200}, the virial radius). An alternate,\ntwo-component SN Ia model (including both prompt and delayed detonations)\nproduces a similar BCG+ICS contribution of 22^{+9}_{-9}%. Because the ICS\ntypically contribute 80% of the BCG+ICS Fe, we conclude that the ICS are\nsignificant, yet often neglected, contributors to the ICM Fe within r_{500}.\nHowever, the BCG+ICS fall short of producing all the Fe, so metal loss from\nstars in other cluster galaxies must also contribute. By combining the\nenrichment from intracluster and galactic stars, we can account for all the\nobserved Fe.

The SN Ia rates, especially as a function of galaxy\nenvironment and redshift, remain a significant source of uncertainty in further\nconstraining the metal loss fraction. For example, increasing the SN Ia rate by\na factor of 1.8 -- to just within the 2 sigma uncertainty for present-day\ncluster early-type galaxies -- allows the combined BCG + ICS + cluster galaxy\nmodel to generate all the ICM Fe with a much lower galactic metal loss fraction\n(~ 0.35).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2008 18:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We present a simple analytic model relating the lightcurve to the\ninternal density structure of the star. We thus show that the standard\nlightcurve proportional to $t^{-5/3}$ only holds at late times. Close to the\npeak luminosity the lightcurve is shallower, deviating more strongly from\n$t^{-5/3}$ for more centrally concentrated (e.g. solar--type) stars. We test\nour model numerically by simulating the tidal disruption of several stellar\nmodels, described by simple polytropic spheres with index $\\gamma$. The\nsimulations agree with the analytical model given two considerations. First,\nthe stars are somewhat inflated on reaching pericentre because of the effective\nreduction of gravity in the tidal field of the black hole. This is well\ndescribed by a homologous expansion by a factor which becomes smaller as the\npolytropic index becomes larger. Second, for large polytropic indices wings\nappear in the tails of the energy distribution, indicating that some material\nis pushed further away from parabolic orbits by shocks in the tidal tails. In\nall our simulations, the $t^{-5/3}$ lightcurve is achieved only at late stages.\nIn particular we predict that for solar type stars, this happens only after the\nluminosity has dropped by at least two magnitudes from the peak.

The average 1.2mm flux for the whole sample is 1.5+/-0.2 mJy. Our\nanalysis focuses on 29 sources in the Lockman Hole field where the average\n1.2mm flux (1.9+/-0.3 mJy) is higher than in other fields (1.1+/-0.2 mJy). The\nanalysis of the sources multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions\nindicates that they are starburst galaxies with far-infrared luminosities\n~10^12-10^13.3 Lsun, and stellar masses of ~0.2-6 x10^11 M_sun.

The origin of such large\nratios is investigated by comparing the average mid-infrared spectra and the\nstacked far-infrared spectral energy distributions of the SWIRE-MAMBO sources\nand of SMGs. The mid-infrared spectra exhibit strong PAH features, and a warm\ndust continuum. The warm dust continuum contributes to ~34% of the mid-infrared\nemission, and is likely associated with an AGN component. This constribution is\nconsistent with what is found in SMGs. The large 24um/1.2mm flux ratios are\nthus not due to AGN emission, but rather to enhanced PAH emission compared to\nSMGs. The analysis of the stacked far-infrared fluxes yields warmer dust\ntemperatures than typically observed in SMGs. Our selection favors warm\nultra-luminous infrared sources at high-z, a class of objects that is rarely\nfound in SMG samples.

We employ approximation algorithms for the graph partitioning\nproblem to characterize as a function of size the statistical and structural\nproperties of partitions of graphs that could plausibly be interpreted as\ncommunities. In particular, we define the network community profile plot, which\ncharacterizes the \"best\" possible community--according to the conductance\nmeasure--over a wide range of size scales. We study over 100 large real-world\nsocial and information networks. Our results suggest a significantly more\nrefined picture of community structure in large networks than has been\nappreciated previously. In particular, we observe tight communities that are\nbarely connected to the rest of the network at very small size scales; and\ncommunities of larger size scales gradually \"blend into\" the expander-like core\nof the network and thus become less \"community-like.\" This behavior is not\nexplained, even at a qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network\ngeneration models. Moreover, it is exactly the opposite of what one would\nexpect based on intuition from expander graphs, low-dimensional or\nmanifold-like graphs, and from small social networks that have served as\ntestbeds of community detection algorithms.

It is known\nthat the integrated parallel electric field along field lines is the key\nquantity determining the rate of reconnection, in contrast with the\ntwo-dimensional case where the electric field itself is the important quantity.\nWe demonstrate that this difference becomes crucial for sufficiently complex\nmagnetic field structures.\n  A numerical method is used to relax a braided magnetic field to an ideal\nforce-free equilibrium; that equilibrium is found to be smooth, with only\nlarge- scale current structures. However, the equilibrium is shown to have a\nhighly filamentary integrated parallel current structure with extremely short\nlength- scales. An analytical model is developed to show that, in a coronal\nsituation, the length scales associated with the integrated parallel current\nstructures will rapidly decrease with increasing complexity, or degree of\nbraiding, of the magnetic field. Analysis shows the decrease in these length\nscales will, for any finite resistivity, eventually become inconsistent with\nthe stability of a force- free field. Thus the inevitable consequence of the\nmagnetic braiding process is shown to be a loss of equilibrium of the coronal\nfield, probably via magnetic reconnection events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2008 12:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The prevalence of\nuncited papers or of highly-cited papers, with respect to the bulk of\npublications, provides important clues as to the dynamics of scientific\nresearch. Using 25 million papers and 600 million references from the Web of\nScience over the 1900-2006 period, this paper proposes a simple model based on\na random selection process to explain the \"uncitedness\" phenomenon and its\ndecline in recent years. We show that the proportion of uncited papers is a\nfunction of 1) the number of articles published in a given year (the competing\npapers) and 2) the number of articles subsequently published (the citing\npapers) and the number of references they contain. Using uncitedness as a\ndeparture point, we demonstrate the utility of the stretched-exponential\nfunction and a form of the Tsallis function to fit complete citation\ndistributions over the 20th century. As opposed to simple power-law fits, for\ninstance, both these approaches are shown to be empirically well-grounded and\nrobust enough to better understand citation dynamics at the aggregate level.\nBased on an expansion of these models, on our new understanding of uncitedness\nand on our large dataset, we are able provide clear quantitative evidence and\nprovisional explanations for an important shift in citation practices around\n1960, unmatched in the 20th century. We also propose a revision of the\n\"citation classic\" category as a set of articles which is clearly\ndistinguishable from the rest of the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2008 13:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-09"}

For\nexample, a large fraction of HVS cluster around the constellation of Leo and\nshare a common travel time of $\\sim 100$-200 Myr.

These stars are arranged in a thinly-collimated\noutgoing ``tidal tail'' stripped from the dwarf during its latest pericentric\npassage. We speculate that some HVS may therefore be tidal debris from a dwarf\nrecently disrupted near the center of the Galaxy. In this interpretation, the\nangular clustering of HVS results because from our perspective the tail is seen\nnearly ``end on'', whereas the common travel time simply reflects the fact that\nthese stars were stripped simultaneously from the dwarf during a single\npericentric passage. This proposal is eminently falsifiable, since it makes a\nnumber of predictions that are distinct from the black-hole ejection mechanism\nand that should be testable with improved HVS datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2008 13:42:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2008 18:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Among the results obtained by\nthis method are proofs of Grunbaum's conjecture about affine regular hexagons\ninscribed in smooth Jordan curves and a new proof of the conjecture of Hadwiger\nabout inscribed parallelograms in smooth, simple, closed curves in the 3-space\n(originally established by Victor Makeev).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2008 13:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2008 14:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-11"}

The flare kernel observed in the white light images has a diameter\nof 300 km, thus rendering it below the resolution limit of most space-based\ntelescopes. Continuum emission is present only during the impulsive stage of\nthe flare, with the effects of chromospheric emission subsequently delayed by\napproximately 2 min. The localized flare emission peaks at 300% above the\nquiescent flux. This large, yet tightly confined, increase in emission is only\nresolvable due to the high spatial resolution of the Swedish Solar Telescope.\nAn investigation of the line-of-sight magnetic field derived from simultaneous\nMDI data shows that the continuum brightening is located very close to a\nmagnetic polarity inversion line.

Using a cross-correlation method, we study the light curves of the\nX-ray dust scattering halo of Cyg X-1, observed with the \\textit{Chandra X-ray\nObservatory}. Significant time lags are found between the light curves of the\npoint source and its halo. This time lag increases with the angular distance\nfrom Cyg X-1, implying a dust concentration at a distance along the line of\nsight (LOS) of 2.0 kpc $\\times$ (0.876 $\\pm$ 0.002) from the Earth. By fitting\nthe observed light curves of the halo at different radii with simulated light\ncurves, we obtain a width of $\\mathit{\\Delta L}=33_{-13}^{+18}$ pc of this dust\nconcentration. The origin of this dust concentration is still not clearly\nknown. The advantage of our method is that we need no assumption of scattering\ncross section, dust grain model, or dust distribution along the LOS. Combining\nthe derived dust distribution from the cross-correlation study with the surface\nbrightness distribution of the halo, we conclude that the two commonly accepted\nmodels of dust grain size distribution need to be modified significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2008 15:47:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2008 15:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 06:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Higgs mass\nregion between 120-200 GeV, in which this signature was proposed as highly\nsensitive, has been studied. The W decays into lnu are considered, where l\nstands for e or mu.
