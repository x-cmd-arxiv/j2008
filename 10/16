Brown dwarfs with masses between that of stars and\nplanets are not massive enough to maintain stable hydrogen-burning fusion\nreactions during most of their lifetime. Their origins are subject to much\ndebate in recent literature because their masses are far below the typical mass\nwhere core collapse is expected to occur. We present the first confirmed\nevidence that brown dwarfs undergo a phase of molecular outflow that is typical\nof young stars. Using the Submillimeter Array, we have obtained a map of a\nbipolar molecular outflow from a young brown dwarf. We estimate an outflow mass\nof 1.6 x 10^-4 M_Sun and a mass-loss rate of 1.4 x 10^-9 M_Sun. These values\nare over two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical ones for T Tauri\nstars. From our millimiter continuum data and our own analysis of Spitzer\ninfrared photometry, we estimate that the brown dwarf has a disk with a mass of\n8 x 10^-3 M_Sun and an outer disk radius of 80 AU. Our results demonstrate that\nthe bipolar molecular outflow operates down to planetary masses, occurring in\nbrown dwarfs as a scaled-down version of the universal process seen in young\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 17:15:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2008 05:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Since any subsurface reflector actually has a\nnon-uniform spatial variation, the use of a more comprehensive principle of\nmigration, by adopting the wave equation, has been argued to be necessary. By\nthis approach an expression has been derived for both the amplitude and the\nphase of a subsurface wavefield with vertical velocity variation.

An\ninversion of the angular oscillations takes place with respect to those\npredicted earlier at low temperature by the nodal approximation.\n  This result, together with the argument that the inversion takes place based\non an approximation valid at moderate fields, indicates that the inversion of\nspecific heat oscillations is an intrinsic feature of nodal superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 19:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This theorem, dating back to the\nfifties essentially states that a Markov chain is uniquely ergodic if it admits\na ``small'' set which is visited infinitely often. This gives an extension of\nthe ideas of Doeblin to the unbounded state space setting. Often this is\nestablished by finding a Lyapunov function with ``small'' level sets. This\ntopic has been studied by many authors (cf. Harris, Hasminskii, Nummelin, Meyn\nand Tweedie). If the Lyapunov function is strong enough, one has a spectral gap\nin a weighted supremum norm (cf. Meyn and Tweedie).\n  Traditional proofs of this result rely on the decomposition of the Markov\nchain into excursions away from the small set and a careful analysis of the\nexponential tail of the length of these excursions. There have been other\nvariations which have made use of Poisson equations or worked at getting\nexplicit constants. The present proof is very direct, and relies instead on\nintroducing a family of equivalent weighted norms indexed by a parameter\n$\\beta$ and to make an appropriate choice of this parameter that allows to\ncombine in a very elementary way the two ingredients (existence of a Lyapunov\nfunction and irreducibility) that are crucial in obtaining a spectral gap.\n  The original motivation of this proof was the authors' work on spectral gaps\nin Wasserstein metrics. The proof presented in this note is a version of our\nreasoning in the total variation setting which we used to guide the\ncalculations in arXiv:math/0602479. While we initially produced it for that\npurpose, we hope that it will be of interest in its own right.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 19:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-16"}

Our sample includes >2000 spectroscopic\nredshifts and ~31000 LBGs in 31 spatially-independent fields over a total area\nof 3261 arcmin^2. These data allow us to select galaxies to 0.07L* and 0.10L*\nat z~2 and z~3, respectively. A maximum likelihood analysis indicates steep\nvalues of alpha(z=2)=-1.73+/-0.07 and alpha(z=3)=-1.73+/-0.13. This result is\nrobust to luminosity dependent systematics in the Ly-alpha equivalent width and\nreddening distributions, is similar to the steep values advocated at z>4, and\nimplies that ~93% of the unobscured UV luminosity density at z~2-3 arises from\nsub-L* galaxies. With a realistic luminosity dependent reddening distribution,\nfaint to moderately luminous galaxies account for >70% and >25% of the\nbolometric luminosity density and present-day stellar mass density,\nrespectively, when integrated over 1.9<z<3.4. We find a factor of 8-9 increase\nin the star formation rate density between z~6 and z~2, due to both a\nbrightening of L* and an increasing dust correction proceeding to lower\nredshifts. The previously observed discrepancy between the integral of the star\nformation history and stellar mass density measurements at z~2 may be\nreconciled by invoking a luminosity dependent reddening correction to the star\nformation history combined with an accounting for the stellar mass contributed\nby UV-faint galaxies. The steep and relatively constant alpha of the UV LF at\nz>2 contrasts with the shallower value inferred locally, suggesting that the\nevolution in the faint-end slope may be dictated simply by the availability of\nlow mass halos capable of supporting star formation at z<2.

The\nsimulated regions have been chosen so as to form a poor cluster with M200~10^14\nh-1 Msun (C1) and a rich cluster with M200~2x10^15 h-1 Msun (C2) at z = 0. The\nsimulated proto-clusters show evidence of ongoing assembly of a dominating\ncentral galaxy. The stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of the\nC2 system is in excess with respect to observational estimates for the\nSpiderweb galaxy, with a total star formation rate which is also larger than\nindicated by observations. We find that the projected velocities of galaxies in\nthe C2 cluster are consistent with observations, while those measured for the\npoorer cluster C1 are too low compared to the observed velocities. We argue\nthat the Spiderweb complex resemble the high-redshift progenitor of a rich\ngalaxy cluster. Our results indicate that the included supernovae feedback is\nnot enough to suppress star formation in these systems, supporting the need of\nintroducing AGN feedback.

In a\nfraction of these haloes where the metallicity is low and UV radiation\nsuppresses H_2 cooling, conditions are thus very favourable for the rapid\nbuild-up of massive black holes. Depending on the progression of metal\nenrichment, the continued suppression of H_2 cooling by external and internal\nUV radiation and the ability to trap the entropy produced by the release of\ngravitational energy, the gas at the centre of the halo is expected to form a\nsupermassive star, a stellar-mass black hole accreting at super-Eddington\naccretion rates or a compact star-cluster undergoing collisional run-away of\nmassive stars at its centre. In all three cases a massive black hole of\ninitially modest mass finds itself at the center of a rapid inflow of gas with\ninflow rates of ~ 1 M_solar\\yr. The massive black hole will thus grow quickly\nto a mass of 10^5 to 10^6 M_solar until further inflow is halted either by\nconsumption of gas by star formation or by the increasing energy and momentum\nfeedback from the growing massive black hole.

In this paper, we\nwill study analytically the scaling of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for\nrandom walks on scale-free small-world networks. To this end, we first map the\nclassical Koch fractal to a network, called Koch network.

Then, we\ninvestigate the standard random walks and trapping issue on the Koch network.\nThrough the recurrence relations derived from the structure of the Koch\nnetwork, we obtain the exact scaling for the MFPT. We show that in the infinite\nnetwork order limit, the MFPT grows linearly with the number of all nodes in\nthe network.

The currently favoured explanation for this brightness boost\nis that of dramatically rising accretion from the disc material around a young\nstar. The mechanism leading to this accretion increase is a point of debate.\nAims: Choosing the Orion Nebula Cluster as representative we simulate accretion\nbursts driven by encounters in dense stellar environments. We investigate\nwhether properties like rise and decay times, event frequency etc. speak for\nencounters as a possible cause for FUor phenomena. Method: We combine cluster\nsimulations performed with the Nbody6++ code with particle simulations that\ndescribe the effect of a fly-by on the disc around a young star to determine\nthe induced mass accretion. Results: The induced accretion rates, the overall\ntemporal accretion profile, decay time and possibly the binarity rate we obtain\nfor encounter-induced accretion agree very well with observations of FUors.\nHowever, the rise-time of one year observed in some FUors is difficult to\nachieve in our simulations unless the matter is stored somewhere close to the\nstar and then released after a certain mass limit is transgressed. The severest\nargument against the FUors phenomenon being caused by encounters is that most\nFUors are found in environments of low stellar density. We extend the\ndiscussion to eccentric binaries and gravitationally unstable discs and find\nthat both models have similar problems in achieving the necessary rise-times.\nConclusions: We predict that in dense young clusters these outbursts should\npredominantly happen close to the cluster center and with large mass ratios\nbetween the involved stars.(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2008 06:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Modal\nimpredicativity occurs when, during reduction, the conclusion of a residual of\na box b interacts with a node that belongs to the proof net inside another\nresidual of b. Technically speaking, superlazy reduction is a new notion of\nreduction that allows to control modal impredicativity.

However, the observed optical flashes accompanying GRBs suggest\nthat the delayed residual collisions due to large timescale variation continue\nto accelerate electrons. We show here that the inverse-Compton (IC) scattering\nof the prompt gamma-rays by these residual internal shock electrons leads to a\nhigh energy emission beyond the previously thought spectral cutoff, in\nagreement with the previous detections of GeV photons by EGRET in several GRBs\nin conjunction with MeV emission. We expect a spectral break due to the\ntransition from the primary to residual internal shock emission at the\npreviously thought spectral cutoff, and expect systematic time delays of high\nenergy photons relative to MeV emission, the discovery of which would provide\nstringent constraint on the outflow properties, but requires large enough\ncollection of high energy photons by, e.g., Fermi and AGILE satellites.\n  The recent Fermi-detected bright GRB 080916c unambiguously shows the shifting\nof the prompt emission toward later times as the photon energy increases, as\npredicted in the residual collision model. The detected prompt, highest energy\nphoton (about 70 GeV in the rest frame of the GRB) may not be produced by\nprimary internal shocks but by IC emission in residual collisions.

Treating both\nthe protein number and gene expression state variables stochastically and on\nequal footing we propose a mapping which connects the molecular level\ndescription of networks to the binary representation. We construct a phase\ndiagram indicating when genes can be considered to be independent and when the\ncoupling between them cannot be neglected leading to synchrony or correlations.\nWe find that an appropriately mapped boolean description reproduces the\nprobabilities of gene expression states of the full stochastic system very well\nand can be transfered to examples of self-regulatory systems with a larger\nnumber of gene copies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2008 15:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We consider the\nperiodic array of cylindrical air rods in a dielectric, and the third medium is\nintroduced as a ring-shaped intermediate layer between the air pores and the\ndielectric background. Using the plane wave method, we have obtained the band\nstructures for the 2D triangular lattice photonic crystals. The dependencies of\nTE and TM band gaps' widths and gaps' edges position on the interlayer\ndielectric constant and interlayer thickness were analyzed. In the framework of\nthis approach, we have estimated the influence of the surface oxide layer on\nthe band structure of macroporous silicon. We observed the shift of the gaps'\nedges to the higher or lower frequencies, depending on the interlayer thickness\nand dielectric constant. We have shown that the existence of a native oxide\nsurface layer should be taken into consideration to understand the optical\nproperties of 2D photonic crystals, particularly in macroporous silicon\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2008 15:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-17"}

In the fuzzball proposal,\nindividual microstates do not have a horizon with the `vacuum' state in its\nvicinity. For a special family of non-extremal microstates it was recently\nfound that emission occurs due to pair creation in an ergoregion, rather than\nat a horizon. In this paper we extend this result to a slightly larger class of\nmicrostates, again finding exact agreement between the emission in the gravity\npicture and the CFT dual. We write down an expression for emission from\ngeometries with ergoregions, in terms of the leading falloff behavior of the\nwavefunctions in the fuzzball region. Finally, we describe another family of\nnonextremal microstates and find their ergoregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2008 15:47:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2008 18:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}
