We\nshow that, because they are not seeing corrected, the use of Petrosian-based\nquantities in magnitude limited surveys leads to biases, and suggest that this\nis one reason why Petrosian-based analyses of BCGs have failed to find\nsignificant differences from the bulk of the early-type population. These\nbiases are not present when seeing-corrected parameters derived from\ndeVaucouleur fits are used. Most of the scaling relations we study show\nevidence for curvature: the most luminous galaxies have smaller velocity\ndispersions, larger sizes, and fainter surface brightnesses than expected if\nthere were no curva-ture. These statements remain true if we replace\nluminosities with stellar masses; they suggest that dissipation is less\nimportant at the massive end. There is curvature in the dynamical to stellar\nmass relation as well: the ratio of dynamical to stellar mass increases as\nstellar mass increases, but it curves upwards from this scaling both at small\nand large stellar masses. In all cases, the curvature at low masses becomes\napparent when the sample becomes dominated by objects with stellar masses\nsmaller than 3 x 10^10 M_Sun. We quantify all these trends using second order\npolynomials; these generally provide significantly better description of the\ndata than linear fits, except at the least luminous end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2008 19:49:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 21:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We then replaced luminosity with\nstellar mass, and measured the \"stellar mass\" FP. The FP steepens slightly as\none moves from shorter to longer wavelengths: the orthogonal fit has slope 1.40\nin g and 1.47 in z. The FP is thinner at longer wavelengths: scatter is 0.062\ndex in g, 0.054 dex in z. The scatter is larger at small galaxy sizes/masses;\nat large masses measurement errors account for essentially all of the observed\nscatter. The FP steepens further when luminosity is replaced with stellar mass,\nto slope ~ 1.6. The intrinsic scatter also reduces further, to 0.048 dex. Since\ncolor and stellar mass-to-light ratio are closely related, this explains why\ncolor can be thought of as the fourth FP parameter. However, the slope of the\nstellar mass FP remains shallower than the value of 2 associated with the\nvirial theorem. This is because the ratio of dynamical to stellar mass\nincreases at large masses as M_d^0.17. The face-on view of the stellar mass\nkappa-space suggests that there is an upper limit to the stellar density for a\ngiven dynamical mass, and this decreases at large masses: M_*/R_e^3 ~ M_d^-4/3.\nWe also study how the estimated coefficients a and b of the FP are affected by\nother selection effects (e.g. excluding small sigma biases a high; excluding\nfainter L biases a low). These biases are seen in FPs which have no intrinsic\ncurvature, so the observation that a and b scale with L and sigma is not, by\nitself, evidence that the Plane is warped. We show that the FP appears to curve\nsharply downwards at the small mass end, and more gradually downwards towards\nlarger masses. Whereas the drop at small sizes is real, most of the latter\neffect is due to correlated errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2008 19:37:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2009 20:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We have done this by constructing co-added HII\nregion luminosity functions (LFs) according to local and central disc surface\nbrightness and fitting Schechter functions to these LFs. The results show that\nthe shape of the HII region LF within LSB galaxies does not change noticeably\nas different limiting (i.e., mu>mu_lim) local surface brightness values are\nused. However, the LFs for HSB galaxies have larger values of L_* and are less\nsteep at the faint-end than those of LSB galaxies for limiting B-band local\nsurface brightness values as faint as mu_B,lim~23-24. Both the LFs and the data\nfor individual HII regions show that luminous (log L>39 ergs/s) HII regions are\nmuch more common within HSB discs than within LSB discs, implying that the\nnewly formed star clusters are also larger. Taking this into account along with\nthe results of Monte Carlo simulations, the shapes of the LFs imply that the\nregions within LSB discs and those within the LSB areas of HSB discs are\nrelatively old (~5 Myr) while the regions within HSB discs for mu_B<24 are\nsignificantly younger (<1 Myr). Since the majority of the LSB galaxies do not\nhave noticeable spiral arms and the majority of the HSB galaxies do, this may\nindicate a transition within HSB discs from spiral arm-driven star formation to\na more locally driven, possibly sporadic form of star formation at mu_B~24, a\ntransition that does not appear to occur within LSB discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2008 16:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Among the most important unsolved questions are how the explosion\nactually proceeds and whether accretion occurs from a companion or via the\nmerging of two white dwarfs. Tycho Brahe's supernova of 1572 (SN 1572) is\nthought to be one of the best candidates for a SN Ia in the Milky Way. The\nproximity of the SN 1572 remnant has allowed detailed studies, such as the\npossible identification of the binary companion, and provides a unique\nopportunity to test theories of the explosion mechanism and the nature of the\nprogenitor. The determination of the yet unknown exact spectroscopic type of SN\n1572 is crucial to relate these results to the diverse population of SNe Ia.\nHere we report an optical spectrum of Tycho Brahe's supernova near maximum\nbrightness, obtained from a scattered-light echo more than four centuries after\nthe direct light of the explosion swept past Earth.

This subject involves controlling a continuum of parameterized dynamical\nsystems with the same open-loop control input. From a viewpoint of mathematical\ncontrol theory, this class of problems is challenging because it requires\nsteering a continuum of dynamical systems between points of interest in an\ninfinite dimensional state space by use of the same control function. The\nexistence of such a control raises fundamental questions of ensemble\ncontrollability. We derive the necessary and sufficient controllability\nconditions and an accompanying analytical optimal control law for ensemble\ncontrol of time-varying linear systems.

This\nbehavior indicates that the one-gluon exchange and the flux-tube interaction do\nnot fully account for the complexity of the dynamics of three light quarks.\nVery recently, the Cornell potential which is of infinte range has been\nupgraded by us toward an exactly solvable trigonometric potential of finite\nrange that interpolates between the inverse-distance potential and the infinite\nwells while passing through a region of linear growth, a reason for which it\ncontains the inverse distance and the linear potentials as first terms in its\nTaylor series decomposition.

And, in the nearly filled (with negative\nelectrons) bands of almost all superconductors, as evidenced by their positive\nHall coefficient in the normal state. According to the theory of hole\nsuperconductivity, metals become superconducting because they are driven to\nexpel negative charge (electrons) from their interior. This is why NIS\ntunneling spectra are asymmetric, with larger current for negatively biased\nsamples. It is also why there is a Meissner effect: as electrons are expelled\ntowards the surface in the presence of a magnetic field, the Lorentz force\nimparts them with azimuthal velocity, thus generating the surface Meissner\ncurrent that screens the interior magnetic field. In type II superconductors,\nthe Lorentz force acting on expelled electrons that don't reach the surface\ngives rise to the azimuthal velocity of the vortex currents. In the absence of\napplied magnetic field, expelled electrons still acquire azimuthal velocity,\ndue to the spin-orbit interaction, in opposite direction for spin-up and\nspin-down electrons: the \"Spin Meissner effect\". This results in a macroscopic\nspin current flowing near the surface of superconductors in the absence of\napplied fields.

There is\nalso evidence that CaII absorbers trace galaxies with more ongoing\nstar-formation than the average quasar absorber. Despite this, relatively\nlittle is known in detail about these unusual absorption systems. Here we\npresent the first high resolution spectroscopic study of 19 CaII quasar\nabsorbers, in the range 0.6<= z_abs<=1.2, with W3934>=0.2A. Their general\ndepletion patterns are similar to measurements in the warm halo phase of the\nMilky Way and Magellanic Clouds ISM. Dust depletions and alpha-enrichments\nprofiles of sub-samples of 7 and 3 absorbers, respectively, are measured using\na combination of Voigt profile fitting and apparent optical depth techniques.\nDeviations in [Cr/Zn]~0.3+-0.1dex and in [Si/Fe]>~0.8+-0.1dex are detected\nacross the profile of one absorber, which we attribute to differential dust\ndepletion. The remaining absorbers have <0.3dex (3sigma limit) variation in\n[Cr/Zn], much like the general DLA population, though the dustiest CaII\nabsorbers remain relatively unprobed in our sample. A limit on electron\ndensities in CaII absorbers, n_e<0.1cm^-3, is derived using the ratio of\nneutral and singly ionised species, assuming a MW-like radiation field. These\nelectron densities may imply hydrogen densities sufficient for the presence of\nmolecular hydrogen in the absorbers. The CaII absorber sample comprises a wide\nrange of velocity widths, v_90=50-470km/s, and velocity structures, thus a\nrange of physical models for their origin, from simple discs to galactic\noutflows and mergers, would be required to explain the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2008 20:13:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2009 14:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here, we quantify the prevalence\nof global starbursts in dwarf galaxies at the present epoch, and infer their\ncharacteristic durations and amplitudes. The analysis is based on the H-alpha\ncomponent of the 11 Mpc H-alpha UV Galaxy Survey (11HUGS), which is providing\nH-alpha and GALEX UV imaging for an approximately volume-limited sample of ~300\nstar-forming galaxies within 11 Mpc. We first examine the completeness\nproperties of the sample, and then directly tally the number of bursting dwarfs\nand compute the fraction of star formation that is concentrated in such\nsystems. Our results are consistent with a picture where dwarfs that are\ncurrently experiencing massive global bursts are just the ~6% tip of a low-mass\ngalaxy iceberg. Moreover, bursts are only responsible for about a quarter of\nthe total star formation in the overall dwarf population, so the majority of\nstars in low-mass systems are not formed in this mode today. Spirals and\nirregulars devoid of H-alpha emission are rare, indicating that the complete\ncessation of star formation generally does not occur in such galaxies and is\nnot characteristic of the inter-burst state, at least for the more luminous\nsystems with M(B)<-15. The starburst statistics presented here directly\nconstrain the duty cycle and the average burst amplitude under the simplest\nassumptions where all dwarf irregulars share a common star formation history\nand undergo similar bursts cycles with equal probability.

The magnetic fields required to accelerate\nCRs to sufficiently high energies need to be much higher than can result from\ncompression of the circumstellar medium (CSM) by a factor 4, as is the case in\nstrong shocks. Non-thermal synchrotron maps of these regions indicate that\nindeed the magnetic field is much stronger, and for young SNRs has a dominant\nradial component while for old SNRs it is mainly toroidal. How these magnetic\nfields get enhanced, or why the field orientation is mainly radial for young\nremnants, is not yet fully understood. We use an adaptive mesh refinement MHD\ncode, AMRVAC, to simulate the evolution of supernova remnants and to see if we\ncan reproduce a mainly radial magnetic field in early stages of evolution. We\nfollow the evolution of the SNR with three different configurations of the\ninitial magnetic field in the CSM: an initially mainly toroidal field, a\nturbulent magnetic field, and a field parallel to the symmetry axis. Although\nfor the latter two topologies a significant radial field component arises at\nthe contact discontinuity due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, no radial\ncomponent can be seen out to the forward shock.

Possibly a higher compression ratio and\nadditional turbulence due to dominant presence of CRs can help us to better\nreproduce the observations in future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2008 21:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-30"}

We study this construction for free\nscalar fields of arbitrary positive mass in any dimension, and for linear\nvector and tensor gauge fields in any dimension. Our main result is to show in\neach case that group averaging converges for states containing a sufficient\nnumber of particles. We consider general $N$-particle states with smooth\nwavefunctions, though we obtain somewhat stronger results when the\nwavefunctions are finite linear combinations of de Sitter harmonics. Along the\nway we obtain explicit expressions for general boost matrix elements in a\nfamiliar basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2008 23:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our model follows the accretion,\ncooling, and ejection of baryonic mass, as a function of radius, inside growing\ndark matter haloes. The surface density profile of the disk is determined by\ndetailed angular momentum conservation, starting from the distribution of\nspecific angular momentum as found in cosmological simulations. Exponential and\nquasi-exponential disks can be produced by our model through a combination of\nsupernova driven galactic outflows (which preferentially remove low angular\nmomentum material), intrinsic variation in the angular momentum distribution of\nthe halo gas, and the inefficiency of star formation at large radii. We use\nobservations from the SDSS NYU-VAGC to show that the median Sersic index of\nblue galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass. For blue galaxies, low mass\ngalaxies have a median n=1.3, while high mass galaxies have a median n=4.

We compute the planet's internal structure using a\nHenyey-type stellar evolution code. The planet's interactions with the\nprotoplanetary disk are calculated using 3-D hydrodynamic simulations. Previous\nmodels of Jupiter's growth have taken the radius of the planet to be\napproximately one Hill sphere radius, Rhill. However, 3-D hydrodynamic\nsimulations show that only gas within 0.25Rhill remains bound to the planet,\nwith the more distant gas eventually participating in the shear flow of the\nprotoplanetary disk. Therefore in our new simulations, the planet's outer\nboundary is placed at the location where gas has the thermal energy to reach\nthe portion of the flow not bound to the planet. We find that the smaller\nradius increases the time required for planetary growth by ~5%. Thermal\npressure limits the rate at which a planet less than a few dozen times as\nmassive as Earth can accumulate gas from the protoplanetary disk, whereas\nhydrodynamics regulates the growth rate for more massive planets. Within a\nmoderately viscous disk, the accretion rate peaks when the planet's mass is\nabout equal to the mass of Saturn. In a less viscous disk hydrodynamical limits\nto accretion are smaller, and the accretion rate peaks at lower mass. To\naccount for disk dissipation, we perform some of our simulations of Jupiter's\ngrowth within a disk whose surface gas density decreases on a timescale of\n3Myr. According to our simulations, proto-Jupiter's distended and\nthermally-supported envelope was too small to capture the planet's current\nretinue of irregular satellites as advocated by Pollack et al. (1979).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2008 03:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-20"}

The SKA will be 50 times more sensitive than any existing radio\nfacility. A majority of the key science for the SKA will be addressed through\nlarge-area imaging of the Universe at frequencies from 300 MHz to a few GHz.\n  The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is aimed squarely in this frequency\nrange, and achieves instantaneous wide-area imaging through the development and\ndeployment of phase-array feed systems on parabolic reflectors. This large\nfield-of-view makes ASKAP an unprecedented synoptic telescope poised to achieve\nsubstantial advances in SKA key science. The central core of ASKAP will be\nlocated at the Murchison Radio Observatory in inland Western Australia, one of\nthe most radio-quiet locations on the Earth and one of the sites selected by\nthe international community as a potential location for the SKA.\n  Following an introductory description of ASKAP, this document contains 7\nchapters describing specific science programmes for ASKAP.\n  The combination of location, technological innovation and scientific program\nwill ensure that ASKAP will be a world-leading radio astronomy facility,\nclosely aligned with the scientific and technical direction of the SKA.

Circular polarization changes sign near the middle of\nthe pulse profile at 1060 MHz, but not observed at 325 and 610 MHz. Remarkable\nfrequency evolution of polarization angle (PA) is observed.

We show that for a particular choice (repulsive exponential) of\nthe wall potentials and the fluid pair-potential parameters, the Euler-Lagrange\nequations for the equilibrium fluid density profiles may be transformed into a\nsingle ordinary differential equation and the profiles obtained by a simple\nquadrature. For certain other choices of the fluid pair-potential parameters\nfluid-fluid phase separation of the bulk fluid is observed.

The observed shapes and\npositions of Fe I lines reveal asymmetries and wavelength shifts that indicate\nthe presence of granulation. In particular, line bisectors show characteristic\nC-shapes while line core wavelengths are blueshifted by an amount that\nincreases with decreasing equivalent width (EW). On average, Fe I line\nbisectors have a span that ranges from nearly 0 for the weakest lines (residual\ncore flux > 0.7) to about 75 m/s for the strongest lines (residual core flux ~\n0.3) while wavelength shifts range from about -150 m/s in the weakest (EW ~ 10\nmA) lines to 0 in the strongest (EW > 100 mA) features. A more detailed\ninspection of the bisectors and wavelength shifts reveals star-to-star\ndifferences that are likely associated with differences in stellar parameters,\nprojected rotational velocity, and stellar activity. For the inactive, slow\nprojected rotational velocity stars, we detect, unequivocally, a plateau in the\nline-shifts at large EW values (EW > 100 mA), a behavior that had been\nidentified before only in the solar spectrum. The detection of this plateau\nallows us to determine the zero point of the convective blueshifts, which is\nuseful to determine absolute radial velocities.

Indeed, ionization energies, excitation energies etc.\nare computed based on picturing electrons as bubbles of charge that\nsymmetrically surround a nucleus. Hence, for example, simple algebraic\nexpressions based on Newtonian force balances are used to predict ionization\nenergies and stable excitation states with remarkable precision. One of the\nmost startling predictions of the model is that there are stable sizes of the\nhydrogen atom electron (bubble diameter) that are smaller (called hydrinos)\nthan that calculated for the standard ground state. Experimental evidence in\nsupport of this novel physical/classical version of quantum is alleged to be\nfound in the existence of super heated hydrogen atoms reported by many teams in\na variety of plasmas. It is postulated that the energy required for creating\nsuper heated H aoms comes from the shrinkage of ground state H atoms to form\nhydrinos.

To\nthis end, one has to rely on distinctive -- and unique -- spectral signatures\nto look for. Internal bremsstrahlung (IB), unavoidable in the presence of\ncharged annihilation products, provides such a signature. In fact, as it\ngenerically dominates the gamma-ray spectrum expected from DM annihilations, at\nhigh energies, it may well turn out to be more important for indirect DM\nsearches than the traditionally looked-for line signals. As illustrated in some\ndetail, the observation of IB signatures would even allow to distinguish\nbetween different DM candidates or to constrain significantly the parameter\nspace of, e.g., neutralino DM. The gamma-ray contributions reported here are\ntherefore of great interest for the already launched Fermi/GLAST satellite and\nthe upcoming new generation of Air Cherenkov Telescope systems like CTA --\nwhich are most sensitive at the high energies where these effects are\nparticularly important. Finally, radiative corrections may even significantly\nalter the positron spectrum from DM annihilations; an intriguing positron\nexcess recently found by the PAMELA satellite might turn out to be an\nindication of the peculiar spectral signature expected in that case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2008 15:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

In these proceedings we will\nargue that metastability is an attractive and testable scenario. The recent\ndevelopments were triggered by the presentation of a simple and calculable\nmodel of metastable SUSY breaking by Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih (ISS),\nwhich we will briefly review. One of the main questions raised by metastability\nis, why did the universe end up in this vacuum. Using the ISS model as an\nexample we will argue that in a large class of models the universe is\nautomatically driven into the metastable state during the early hot phase and\ngets trapped there. This makes metastability a natural option from the\ncosmological point of view. However, it may be more than that. The\nphenomenologically required gaugino masses require the breaking of R-symmetry.\nHowever, in scenarios with a low supersymmetry breaking scale, e.g., gauge\nmediation a powerful theorem due to Nelson and Seiberg places this at odds with\nsupersymmetry breaking in a truely stable state and metstability becomes\n(nearly) inevitable. Turning around one can now experimentally test whether\ngauge mediation is realised in nature thereby automatically testing the\npossibility of a metastability of the vacuum. Indeed, already the LHC may give\nus crucial information about the stability of the vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2008 15:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
