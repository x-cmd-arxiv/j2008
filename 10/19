It\nwas discovered in recent years that string theory on AdS_5xS^5 admits a Lax\nformulation. However, the complete statement of integrability requires not only\nthe existence of a Lax formulation, but also that the resulting integrals of\nmotion are in pairwise involution. This idea is central to the first part of\nthis thesis. Exploiting this integrability we apply algebro-geometric methods\nto string theory on RxS^3 and obtain the general finite-gap solution. The\nconstruction is based on an invariant algebraic curve previously found in the\nAdS_5xS^5 case. However, encoding the dynamics of the solution requires\nspecification of additional marked points. By restricting the symplectic\nstructure of the string to this algebro-geometric data we derive the\naction-angle variables of the system. We then perform a first-principle\nsemiclassical quantisation of string theory on RxS^3 as a toy model for strings\non AdS_5xS^5. The result is exactly what one expects from the dual gauge theory\nperspective, namely the underlying algebraic curve discretises in a natural\nway. We also derive a general formula for the fluctuation energies around the\ngeneric finite-gap solution. The ideas used can be generalised to AdS_5xS^5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2008 14:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-23"}

The tiling is generated by the fixpoint-free action of\nthe group of deck transformations. By a general theorem, this group is\nisomorphic to the first homotopy group. Multiplicity and selection rules appear\nin the form of reduction of group representations. A basis for the harmonic\nanalysis on the (n-1)-sphere is given by the spherical harmonics which\ntransform according to irreducible representations of the orthogonal group. The\ndeck transformations form a subgroup, and so the representations of the\northogonal group can be reduced to those of this subgroup. Upon reducing to the\nidentity representation of the subgroup, the reduced subset of spherical\nharmonics becomes periodic on the tiling and tunes the harmonic analysis on the\n(n-1)-sphere to the manifold. A particular class of spherical 3-manifolds\narises from the Platonic polyhedra. The harmonic analysis on the Poincare\ndodecahedral 3-manifold was analyzed along these lines. For comparison we\nconstruct here the harmonic analysis on simplicial spherical manifolds of\ndimension n=1,2,3. Harmonic analysis applied to the cosmic microwave background\nby selection rules can provide evidence for multiply connected cosmic\ntopologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2008 14:56:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2008 18:29:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2009 16:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-17"}

The CO(4-3) line as observed with PdBI has a full line width of ~1000\nkm/s, an integrated line flux of 0.66 Jy km/s, and a CO luminosity of 3.2e10\nL_sun. Comparison to the 3.3sigma detection of the CO(2-1) line emission with\nthe VLA suggests that the molecular gas is likely thermalized to the J=4-3\ntransition level. The corresponding molecular gas mass is 2.6e10 M_sun assuming\nan ULIRG-like conversion factor. From the spatial offset of the red- and\nblue-shifted line peaks and the line width a dynamical mass of 1.1e11 M_sun is\nestimated assuming a merging scenario. The molecular gas distribution coincides\nwith the rest-frame optical and radio position of the object while being offset\nby 0.5'' from the previously detected Ly$\\alpha$ emission. J1000+0234 exhibits\nvery typical properties for lower redshift (z~2) sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs)\nand thus is very likely one of the long sought after high redshift (z>4)\nobjects of this population.

The question of equivalence between different\nensembles is not at all obvious and has been addressed in the literature, with\nsometimes contradicting conclusions. We address this problem by studying the\nscaling properties of the ensemble difference for two different chain models,\nas a function of the degree of polymerization.
