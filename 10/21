Here we show that if the annihilation cross section\nscales as 1/v, then there is a burst of WIMP annihilation in the first\ndark-matter halos that form at redshifts z ~ 100-200. If the annihilation is to\ngamma rays in the energy range 100 keV - 300 GeV, or to electron-positron pairs\nin the energy range GeV - 2 TeV, then there remains a contribution to the\ndiffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background today. Upper limits to this\nbackground provide constraints to the annihilation cross section. If the photon\nor electron-positron energies fall outside these energy ranges, then the\nradiation is absorbed by the intergalactic medium (IGM) and thus ionizes and\nheats the IGM. In this case, cosmic microwave background constraints to the\nionization history also put limits on the annihilation cross section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2008 19:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2008 15:07:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2008 19:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-21"}

In particular, we examine systematics due to\nAGN variability, contamination due to constant spectral components (i.e.,\nnarrow lines and host galaxy flux), data quality (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio,\nS/N), and blending of spectral features by comparing the precision and accuracy\nof single-epoch mass measurements to those of recent reverberation mapping\nstudies. We calculate masses by characterizing the broad Hbeta emission line by\nboth the full width at half maximum and the line dispersion and demonstrate the\nimportance of removing narrow emission-line components and host starlight. We\nfind that the reliability of line width measurements rapidly decreases for S/N\nlower than ~10 to 20 (per pixel) and that fitting the line profiles instead of\ndirect measurement of the data does not mitigate this problem but can, in fact,\nintroduce systematic errors. We also conclude that a full spectral\ndecomposition to deblend the AGN and galaxy spectral features is unnecessary\nexcept to judge the contribution of the host galaxy to the luminosity and to\ndeblend any emission lines that may inhibit accurate line width measurements.\nFinally, we present an error budget which summarizes the minimum observable\nuncertainties as well as the amount of additional scatter and/or systematic\noffset that can be expected from the individual sources of error investigated.\nIn particular, we find that the minimum observable uncertainty in single-epoch\nmass estimates due to variability is <~ 0.1 dex for high S/N (>~ 20 per pixel)\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2008 19:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We find that, while the atmospheric cut-off\nfrequency and the propagation properties of the different oscillating modes\ndepend on the magnetic feature, in all the cases the power that reaches the\nhigh chromosphere above the atmospheric cut-off comes directly from the\nphotosphere by means of linear vertical wave propagation rather than from\nnon-linear interaction of modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2008 17:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We identify 152 galaxies that harbor\nAGN, based on XMM observations of 7543 galaxies (i<22.5). Star formation rates\n(SFRs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the\n[OII]3727 emission-line, corrected for an AGN contribution. We find that the\nmajority of AGN hosts have significant levels of star formation with a\ndistribution spanning ~1-100 Msun yr^-1. The close association between AGN\nactivity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the AGN\nfraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-frame\ncolor (U-V) and spectral index Dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selection\nalleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when using\nluminosity-limited samples. We also find that the SFRs of AGN hosts evolve with\ncosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population and\nexplains the low SFRs in AGNs (z<0.3) from the SDSS. We conclude that the\nconditions most conducive for AGN activity are a massive host galaxy and a\nlarge reservoir of gas. Furthermore, a direct correlation between mass\naccretion rate onto SMBHs and SFR is shown to be weak although the average\nratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for a\nco-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. Our\nfindings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an AGN lifetime substantially\nshorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regarding\nfueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [Abridged].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2008 20:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

Today, the emission from astrophysical sources is by\nlarge best known at energies below 10 keV. The main reason for this situation\nis purely technical since grazing incidence reflection has so far been limited\nto the soft X-ray band. Above 10 keV all the observations have been obtained\nwith collimated detectors or coded mask instruments. To make a leap step\nforward in X-ray astronomy above 10 keV it is necessary to extend the principle\nof focusing X ray optics to higher energies, up to 80 keV and beyond. To this\nend, ASI and CNES are presently studying the implementation of a X-ray mission\ncalled Simbol-X.\n  Taking advantage of emerging technology in mirror manufacturing and\nspacecraft formation flying, Simbol-X will push grazing incidence imaging up to\n80 keV and beyond, providing a strong improvement both in sensitivity and\nangular resolution compared to all instruments that have operated so far above\n10 keV.

This sample represents an increase in sub-DLA D-index\nstatistics by a factor of four over the sample used by Ellison (2006). We\ninvestigate various techniques to define the velocity spread (Delta v) of the\nMgII line to determine an optimal D-index for the identification of DLAs. The\nsuccess rate of DLA identification is 50 -- 55%, depending on the velocity\nlimits used, improving by a few percent when the column density of FeII is\nincluded in the D-index calculation. We recommend the set of parameters that is\njudged to be most robust, have a combination of high DLA identification rate\n(57%) and low DLA miss rate (6%) and most cleanly separate the DLAs and\nsub-DLAs (Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability 0.5%). These statistics demonstrate\nthat the D-index is the most efficient technique for selecting low redshift DLA\ncandidates: 65% more efficient than selecting DLAs based on the equivalent\nwidths of MgII and FeII alone. We also investigate the effect of resolution on\ndetermining the N(HI) of sub-DLAs. We convolve echelle spectra of sub-DLA Lya\nprofiles with Gaussians typical of the spectral resolution of instruments on\nthe Hubble Space Telescope and compare the best fit N(HI) values at both\nresolutions.

This phenomenon is called the dissipation\nanomaly predicted by Kolmogorov's theory for the actual Navier-Stokes\nequations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2008 01:01:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The virial mass estimates from Peterson et al. (2004)\nallow us to calculate Eddington ratios lambda_Edd for the sample using the\nbolometric accretion luminosities determined directly from the SEDs. We\ncalculate hard X-ray bolometric corrections kappa_2-10keV for the sample and\nconfirm a trend for increasing bolometric correction with Eddington ratio\nproposed in previous studies. Our comparison with previous work on these\nobjects suggests that the OM bandpass may be less susceptible to intrinsic\nreddening than the far-UV peak of the thermal disc spectrum in AGN, yielding\nlarger bolometric corrections than previous work: kappa_2-10keV ~ 15 - 30 for\nlambda_Edd <~ 0.1, kappa_2-10keV ~ 20 - 70 for 0.1 <~ lambda_Edd <~ 0.2 and\nkappa_2-10keV ~ 70 - 150 for lambda_Edd >~ 0.2, but part of this increase could\nbe attributed to spectral complexity preventing accurate recovery of the\nintrinsic luminosity in some sources. Long-term optical-UV variability\ncontributes a second-order, but significant change to the total bolometric\nluminosity when comparing multiple observations for individual objects.We also\nconsider the effect of a recently proposed correction for radiation pressure\nwhen determining black hole masses with reverberation mapping, and find that\nthe revised mass estimates do not significantly alter the range of bolometric\ncorrections seen but may yield a narrower distribution of Eddington ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2008 09:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The new fermions are dual to the\noriginal ones and correspond to weakly interacting quasiparticles in the case\nof strong local correlations in the Hubbard model. The method starts with\ndynamical mean-field theory as a zeroth-order approximation and includes\nnon-local effects in a perturbative way. In contrast to cluster approaches,\nthis method utilizes an exact transition to a dual set of variables. It\ntherefore becomes possible to treat the irreducible vertices of an effective\n{\\it single-impurity} problem as small parameters. This provides a very\nefficient interpolation between band-like weak-coupling and atomic limits. The\nmethod is illustrated on the two-dimensional Hubbard model.

The state (action) in traditional RL is\nidentified as the eigen state (eigen action) in QRL. The state (action) set can\nbe represented with a quantum superposition state and the eigen state (eigen\naction) can be obtained by randomly observing the simulated quantum state\naccording to the collapse postulate of quantum measurement. The probability of\nthe eigen action is determined by the probability amplitude, which is\nparallelly updated according to rewards. Some related characteristics of QRL\nsuch as convergence, optimality and balancing between exploration and\nexploitation are also analyzed, which shows that this approach makes a good\ntradeoff between exploration and exploitation using the probability amplitude\nand can speed up learning through the quantum parallelism. To evaluate the\nperformance and practicability of QRL, several simulated experiments are given\nand the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of QRL algorithm\nfor some complex problems.
