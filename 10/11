The closed string state is a nonlinear\nfunctional of the open string field and changes by a BRST-exact term under a\ngauge transformation of the solution. As a result, its contraction with an\non-shell closed string state provides a gauge-invariant observable of open\nstring field theory. Unlike previously known observables, however, the\ncontraction with off-shell closed string states in the Fock space is well\ndefined and regular. Moreover, we claim that the BRST-invariant closed string\nstate coincides, up to a possible BRST-exact term, with the boundary state of\nthe boundary conformal field theory which the solution is expected to describe.\nOur construction requires a choice of a propagator strip. If we choose the\nSchnabl propagator strip, the BRST-invariant state becomes explicitly\ncalculable. We calculate it for various known analytic solutions of open string\nfield theory and, remarkably, we find that it precisely coincides with the\nboundary state without any additional BRST-exact term. Our results imply, in\nparticular, that the wildly oscillatory rolling tachyon solution of open string\nfield theory actually describes the regular closed string physics studied by\nSen using the boundary state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2008 17:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-13"}

We compute the\nphotodesorption efficiencies of amorphous water ice and elucidate the\nmechanisms by which desorption occurs. Classical molecular dynamics\ncalculations were performed for a compact amorphous ice surface at 10 K thought\nto be representative of interstellar ice. Dissociation and desorption of H2O\nmolecules in the top six monolayers are considered following absorption into\nthe first excited electronic state with photons in the 1300-1500 Angstrom\nrange. The trajectories of the H and OH photofragments are followed until they\nescape or become trapped in the ice. The probability for H2O desorption per\nabsorbed UV photon is 0.5-1% in the top three monolayers, then decreases to\n0.03% in the next two monolayers, and is negligible deeper into the ice. The\nmain H2O removal mechanism in the top two monolayers is through separate\ndesorption of H and OH fragments. Removal of H2O molecules from the ice, either\nas H2O itself or its products, has a total probability of 2-3% per absorbed UV\nphoton in the top two monolayers. In the third monolayer the probability is\nabout 1% and deeper into the ice the probability of photodesorption falling to\ninsignificant numbers. The probability of any removal of H2O per incident\nphoton is estimated to be 3.7x10^-4, with the probability for photodesorption\nof intact H2O molecules being 1.4x10^-4 per incident photon.

The former addressed only the ground state, now known as the\n\"BCS-Leggett\" wave-function and the key contributions of the latter pertain to\ncalculations of the superfluid transition temperature $T_c$. These two papers\nhave given rise to two main and, importantly, distinct, theoretical schools in\nthe BCS-BEC crossover literature. The first of these extends the BCS-Leggett\nground state to finite temperature and the second extends the NSR scheme away\nfrom $T_c$ both in the superfluid and normal phases. It is now rather widely\naccepted that these extensions of NSR produce a different ground state than\nthat first introduced by Leggett. Our analysis shows how the NSR-based approach\nviews the bosonic contributions more completely but it treats the fermions as\n\"quasi-free\". By contrast, the BCS-Leggett based approach treats the fermionic\ncontributions more completely but it treats the bosons as \"quasi-free\". The NSR\nbased schemes approach the crossover between BCS and BEC by starting from the\nBEC limit and the BCS-Leggett based scheme approaches this crossover by\nstarting from the BCS limit. Ultimately, one would like to combine these two\nschemes. In this paper we review the strengths and weaknesses of both\napproaches. To reach a full understanding, it is important in the future to\ninvest effort in investigating in more detail the T=0 aspects of NSR-based\ntheory and the $T \\neq 0$ aspects of BCS-Leggett theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2008 18:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Specifically, we assume that the stabilizer\ngroup of a code (the gauge group for subsystem codes) can be generated by local\nPauli operators such that the support of any generator is bounded by a\nhypercube of constant size. Our first result concerns the optimal scaling of\nthe distance $d$ with the linear size of the lattice $L$. We prove an upper\nbound $d=O(L^{D-1})$ which is tight for D=1,2. This bound applies to both\nsubspace and subsystem stabilizer codes. Secondly, we analyze the suitability\nof stabilizer codes for building a self-correcting quantum memory. Any\nstabilizer code with geometrically local generators can be naturally\ntransformed to a local Hamiltonian penalizing states that violate the\nstabilizer condition. A degenerate ground-state of this Hamiltonian corresponds\nto the logical subspace of the code. We prove that for D=1,2 the height of the\nenergy barrier separating different logical states is upper bounded by a\nconstant independent of the lattice size L. The same result holds if there are\nunused logical qubits that are treated as \"gauge qubits\".

One\nof these regions is the fourth Galactic quadrant, in the sector comprised\nbetween Vela and Carina (270 <l< 300) where no spiral arms have been detected\nso far in the optical beyond 270. By means of deep UBVI photometry, we search\nfor spiral features in known low absorption windows.U photometry, although\ndemanding, constitutes a powerful tool to detect and characterize distant\naggregates, and allows to derive firmer distance estimates. We studied a\ndirection close to the tangent (l=290) to the Carina arm, in an attempt to\ndetect optical spiral tracers beyond the Carina branch, where radio\nobservations and models predictions indicate the presence of the extension of\nthe Perseus and Norma-Cygnus spiral arms in the fourth quadrant.Along this line\nof sight, we detect three distinct groups of young stars. Two of them, at 2.5\nand 6.0 kpc, belong to the Carina spiral arm (which is crossed twice in this\nparticular direction).The latter is here detected for the first time. The third\ngroup, at a distance of 12.7 kpc, is part of the Perseus arm which lies beyond\nthe Carina arm, and constitutes the first optical detection of this arm in the\nfourth Galactic quadrant. The position of this feature is compatible with HI\nobservations and model predictions. We furthermore present evidence that this\nextremely distant group, formerly thought to be a star cluster (Shorlin 1), is\nin fact a diffuse young population. In addition, our data-set does not support\nthe possible presence of the Monoceros Ring toward this direction.

From the\nbest dataset, taken on day 13.8 after outburst, we reconstruct the temperature\ndistribution and derive elemental abundances. We find evidence for at least two\ndistinct temperature components on day 13.8 and a reduction of temperature with\ntime. The X-ray flux decreases as a power-law, and the power-law index changes\nfrom -5/3 to -8/3 around day 70 after outburst. This can be explained by\ndifferent decay mechanisms for the hot and cool components. The decay of the\nhot component and the decrease in temperature are consistent with radiative\ncooling, while the decay of the cool component can be explained by the\nexpansion of the ejecta. We find overabundances of N and of alpha-elements,\nwhich could either represent the composition of the secondary that provides the\naccreted material or that of the ejecta.

In this case we show that for $N$ and $p$ as\nabove either $N$ is $PD^1$ at $p$ and $G/N$ is virtually $PD^2$ at $p$ or $N$\nis $PD^2$ at $p$ and $G/N$ is virtually $PD^1$ at $p$. In particular if $G$ is\npro-$p$ then either $N$ is infinite cyclic and $G/N$ is virtually Demushkin or\n$N$ is Demushkin and $G/N$ is virtually infinite cyclic. We apply this results\nto deduce structural information on the profinite completions of ascending\nHNN-extensions of free groups. We also give some implications of our theory to\nthe congruence kernels of certain arithmetic groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Oct 2008 13:52:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 18:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-23"}

Indeed, g modes should be the best probes\nto infer the properties of the solar nuclear core that represents more than\nhalf of the total mass of the Sun. Concerning the dynamics of the solar core,\nwe can study how future observations of individual g modes could enhance our\nknowledge of the rotation profile of the deep radiative zone. Applying\ninversions on a set of real p-mode splittings coupled with either one or\nseveral g modes, we have checked the improvement of the inferred rotation\nprofile when different error bars are considered for the g modes. Moreover,\nusing a new methodology based on the analysis of the almost constant separation\nof the dipole gravity modes, we can introduce new constraints on solar models.\nFor that purpose, we can compare g-mode predictions computed from several\nmodels including different physical inputs with the g-mode asymptotic signature\ndetected in GOLF data and calculate the correlation.

Suzaku observation of the direction, (l, b) = (235, 0), showed an\nOVII Kalpha emission intensity comparable with that of the MBM-12 on cloud\nSuzaku observation, but revealed a narrow bump peaked at ~ 0.9 keV. The latter\ncomponent is partly filling the decrease of the extragalactic component in\nmidplane. The feature can be well represented by a thin thermal emission with a\ntemperature of about 0.8 keV. Because of the high pressure implied for\nspatially extended hot gas, the emission is likely a sum of unresolved faint\nsources. We consider a large fraction of the emission originates from faint dM\nstars. We constructed a model spectrum for spatially unresolved dM stars that\nconsistently explains the observed spectrum and the surface brightness. The\nmodel also suggests that the emission from dM stars decreases very rapidly with\nincreasing b, and thus that it cannot compensate entirely the decrease of the\nextragalactic component at b ~ 2 - 10 deg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Oct 2008 14:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-14"}

One approach to\nmeasuring the substructure mass fraction is to analyze the fluxes of images\nthat have been strongly lensed by a galaxy. Flux ratios between images that are\nanomalous with respect to smooth (no substructure) models have previously\nsuggested that there is a greater amount of substructure than found in dark\nmatter simulations. One measure of anomalous flux ratios is parity dependence\n-- that the fluxes of different images of a source are perturbed differently.\nIn this paper, we discuss parity dependence as a probe of dark matter\nsubstructure. We find that reproducing the observed parity dependence requires\na significant alignment between concentrated dark matter clumps and images. The\nresults may imply a larger fraction of mass in substructures than suggested by\nsome dark matter simulations and that the observed parity dependence is\nunlikely to be reproduced by luminous satellites of lens galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Oct 2008 14:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
