Restricting attention to a 1-dimensional system with bond\ndisorder for specificity, a transformation procedure is developed to deduce,\nfrom given distribution functions characterizing the system disorder, explicit\nexpressions for the memory functions. It is shown how to use the memory\nfunctions in the Lapace domain forms in which they first appear, and in the\ntime domain forms which are obtained via numerical inversion algorithms, to\naddress time evolution of the system beyond the asymptotic domain of large\ntimes normally treated. An analytic but approximate procedure is provided to\nobtain the memories, in addition to the inversion algorithm. Good agreement of\neffective medium theory predictions with numerically computed exact results is\nfound for all time ranges for the distributions used except near the\npercolation limit as expected.

In many pulsars, the\nprojections produce two clusters of data points that reside at antipodal points\non the sphere. The clusters are formed by fluctuations in polarization\namplitude that are parallel to the unit vectors representing the polarization\nstates of the wave propagation modes in the pulsar magnetosphere. In other\npulsars, however, the patterns are more complex, resembling annuli and bow ties\nor bars. The formation of these complex patterns is not understood and largely\nunexplored. An empirical model of pulsar polarization is used to show that\nthese patterns arise from polarization fluctuations that are perpendicular to\nthe mode vectors. The model also shows that the modulation index of the\npolarization amplitude is an indicator of polarization pattern complexity. A\nstochastic version of generalized Faraday rotation can cause the orientation of\nthe polarization vectors to fluctuate and is a possible candidate for the\nperpendicular fluctuations incorporated in the model. Alternative models\nindicate that one mode experiences perpendicular fluctuations and the other\ndoes not, suggesting that the fluctuations could also be due to a\nmode-selective random process, such as scattering in the magnetosphere.

At $z<2.5$, quasar clustering depends weakly on\nluminosity and virial black hole mass, with typical uncertainty levels $\\sim\n10%$ for the measured correlation lengths. These weak dependences are\nconsistent with models in which substantial scatter between quasar luminosity,\nvirial black hole mass and the host dark matter halo mass has diluted any\nclustering difference, where halo mass is assumed to be the relevant quantity\nthat best correlates with clustering strength. However, the most luminous and\nmost massive quasars are more strongly clustered (at the $\\sim 2\\sigma$ level)\nthan the remainder of the sample, which we attribute to the rapid increase of\nthe bias factor at the high-mass end of host halos.

The\nmodel is applicable in simulations in which individual star forming regions -\nthe giant molecular complexes - can be identified (resolution of tens of pc)\nand their mean internal density estimated reliably, even if internal structure\nis not resolved. In agreement with previous studies, calculations based on our\nmodel show that the transition from atomic to fully molecular phase depends\nprimarily on the metallicity, which we assume is directly related to the dust\nabundance, and clumpiness of the interstellar medium. The clumpiness simply\nboosts the formation rate of molecular hydrogen, while dust serves both as a\ncatalyst of molecular hydrogen formation and as an additional shielding from\ndissociating UV radiation. The upshot is that it is difficult to form\nfully-shielded giant molecular clouds while gas metallicity is low.

Philosophers of biology have\nargued that when biologists talk about information in genes and in evolution,\nthey are not talking about the sort of information that Shannon's theory\naddresses. First, philosophers have suggested that Shannon theory is only\nuseful for developing a shallow notion of correlation, the so-called \"causal\nsense\" of information. Second they typically argue that in genetics and\nevolutionary biology, information language is used in a \"semantic sense,\"\nwhereas semantics are deliberately omitted from Shannon theory. Neither\ncritique is well-founded. Here we propose an alternative to the causal and\nsemantic senses of information: a transmission sense of information, in which\nan object X conveys information if the function of X is to reduce, by virtue of\nits sequence properties, uncertainty on the part of an agent who observes X.\nThe transmission sense not only captures much of what biologists intend when\nthey talk about information in genes, but also brings Shannon's theory back to\nthe fore. By taking the viewpoint of a communications engineer and focusing on\nthe decision problem of how information is to be packaged for transport, this\napproach resolves several problems that have plagued the information concept in\nbiology, and highlights a number of important features of the way that\ninformation is encoded, stored, and transmitted as genetic sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2008 22:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-24"}

Sparsity means that usually x_{i}=0.\nDistance between points is a variant of the Hamming distance. Dimensional\nreduction converts the sparse heterogeneous problem into a lower dimensional\nfull homogeneous problem. However we will see that the converted problem can be\nmuch harder to solve than the original problem. Instead we suggest a direct\napproach. It consists of T tries. In try t we rearrange the coordinates in\ndecreasing order of (1-r_{t,i})\\frac{p_{i,11}}{p_{i,01}+p_{i,10}}\n\\ln\\frac{1}{p_{i,1*}} where 0<r_{t,i}<1 are uniform pseudo-random numbers, and\nthe p's are the coordinate's statistical parameters.

It is shown that the gravitino mass may be much smaller than the\nHubble scale during inflation if at least one of the non-perturbative terms has\na positive exponent. Higher order corrections to the Kahler potential have to\nbe taken into account in such models. Those corrections are used to stabilize\nthe potential in the axion direction in the vicinity of the inflection point.\nModels with only negative exponents require uplifting and in consequence have\nthe supersymmetry breaking scale higher than the inflation scale. Fine-tuning\nof parameters and initial conditions is analyzed in some detail for both types\nof models.

This path integral is difficult\nto define rigorously because of analytic problems whose resolution may\nultimately require knowledge of non-perturbative or even Planck scale physics.\nAlternatively, QFT can be formulated directly in the particle picture, namely\nas a sum over all multi-particle paths, i.e., over Feynman graphs. This path\nintegral is well-defined, as a map between rings of formal power series. This\nsuggests a program for determining which structures of QFT are provable for\nthis path integral and thus are combinatorial in nature, and which structures\nare actually sensitive to analytic issues. For a start, we show that the fact\nthat the Legendre transform of the sum of connected graphs yields the effective\naction is indeed combinatorial in nature and is thus independent of analytic\nassumptions. Our proof also leads to new methods for the efficient\ndecomposition of Feynman graphs into $n$-particle irreducible (nPI) subgraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2008 14:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-24"}
