We offer an analysis of oscillation phenomena\ninvolving neutrinos (applying equally well to neutral mesons) that takes\nentanglement into account.

New gr light curves permit us to detect significant intrinsic\nfluctuations, to determine new time delays, and thus to gain perspective on the\nmechanism of intrinsic variability in Q0957+561. We use new optical frames of\nQ0957+561 in the g and r passbands from January 2005 to July 2007. These frames\nare part of an ongoing long-term monitoring with the Liverpool robotic\ntelescope. We also introduce two photometric pipelines that are applied to the\nnew gr frames of Q0957+561. The transformation pipeline incorporates\nzero-point, colour, and inhomogeneity corrections to the instrumental\nmagnitudes, so final photometry to the 1-2% level is achieved for both quasar\ncomponents. The two-colour final records are then used to measure time delays.\nThe gr light curves of Q0957+561 show several prominent events and gradients,\nand some of them (in the g band) lead to a time delay between components of 417\n+/- 2 d (1 sigma). We do not find evidence of extrinsic variability in the\nlight curves of Q0957+561. We also explore the possibility of a delay between a\nlarge event in the g band and the corresponding event in the r band. The gr\ncross-correlation reveals a time lag of 4.0 +/- 2.0 d (1 sigma; the g-band\nevent is leading) that confirms a previous claim of the existence of a delay\nbetween the g and r band in this lensed quasar. The time delays (between quasar\ncomponents and between optical bands) from the new records and previous ones in\nsimilar bands indicate that most observed variations in Q0957+561 (amplitudes\nof about 100 mmag and timescales of about 100 d) are very probably due to\nreverberation within the gas disc around the supermassive black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2008 16:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\ncolor distribution of the globular clusters in all four galaxies shows a broad\npeak centered on g-I ~ 1.4, while PGC 6240 and PGC 42871 show a significant\nnumber of globular clusters with g-I ~ 1.0.

We find\nthat three of the four sample galaxies show evidence for the presence of an\nintermediate-age (~ 1 Gyr) globular cluster population, in addition to the old\nmetal-poor GC population seen in normal early-type galaxies.

This work refines our previous analysis mainly by greatly improving\nthe definition of the coordinate system, which reaches a long-term astrometric\naccuracy of 300 microarcsecond, and by investigating in detail the individual\nsystematic error contributions. The combination of a long time baseline and the\nexcellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allow us to determine\norbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full\nrevolution since our monitoring began. Our main results are: all stellar orbits\nare fit extremely well by a single point mass potential to within the\nastrometric uncertainties, which are now 6 times better than in previous\nstudies. The central object mass is (4.31 +- 0.06|stat +- 0.36|R0) * 10^6 M_sun\nwhere the fractional statistical error of 1.5 percent is nearly independent\nfrom R0 and the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in R0. Our current\nbest estimate for the distance to the Galactic Center is R0 = 8.33 +- 0.35 kpc.\nThe dominant errors in this value is systematic. The mass scales with distance\nas (3.95 +- 0.06) * 10^6 M_sun * (R0/8kpc)^2.19. The orientations of orbital\nangular momenta for stars in the central arcsecond are random. We identify six\nof the stars with orbital solutions as late type stars, and six early-type\nstars as members of the clockwise rotating disk system, as was previously\nproposed. We constrain the extended dark mass enclosed between the pericenter\nand apocenter of S2 at less than 0.066, at the 99% confidence level, of the\nmass of Sgr A*. This is two orders of magnitudes larger than what one would\nexpect from other theoretical and observational estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Oct 2008 10:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

This spin probe signature of freezing has been\nobserved at an anomalously low temperature when a milimoler solution of TEMPOL\nis slowly cooled from room temperature. A systematic observation has revealed a\nspin probe concentration dependence of these freezing and respective melting\npoints. These results can be explained in terms of localization of spin probe\nand liquid water, most probably in the interstices of ice grains, in an ice\nmatrix. The lowering of spin probe freezing point, along with the secondary\nevidences, like spin probe concentration dependence of peak-to-peak width in\nfrozen limit signal, indicates a possible size dependence of these\nlocalizations/entrapments with spin probe concentration. A weak concentration\ndependence of spin probe assisted freezing and melting points, which has been\nobserved for TEMPO in comparison to TEMPOL, indicates different natures of\ninteractions with water of these two probes.

One\nof the main sources of wave energy dissipation lies in boundary layers. The\npresent work is entirely devoted to thorough analysis of the dispersion\nrelation of the novel visco-potential formulation. Namely, in this study we\nrelax all assumptions of the weak dependence of the wave frequency on time. As\na result, we have to deal with complex integro-differential equations that\ndescribe transient behaviour of the phase and group velocities. Using numerical\ncomputations, we show several snapshots of these important quantities at\ndifferent times as functions of the wave number. Good qualitative agreement\nwith previous study [Dutykh2009] is obtained. Thus, we validate in some sense\napproximations made anteriorly. There is an unexpected conclusion of this\nstudy. According to our computations, the bottom boundary layer creates\ndisintegrating modes in the group velocity. In the same time, the imaginary\npart of the phase velocity remains negative for all times. This result can be\ninterpreted as a new kind of instability which is induced by the bottom\nboundary layer effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Oct 2008 15:36:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 May 2009 19:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2009 13:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}
