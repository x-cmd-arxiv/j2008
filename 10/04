The load on an edge\nis defined to be the number of cuts in the solution crossing the edge. In the\ncapacitated version of the problem the goal is to minimize the maximum relative\nload on any edge--the ratio of the edge's load to its capacity. Multiway cut\npacking arises in the context of graph labeling problems where we are given a\npartial labeling of a set of items and a neighborhood structure over them, and,\ninformally, the goal is to complete the labeling in the most consistent way.\nThis problem was introduced by Rabani, Schulman, and Swamy (SODA'08), who\ndeveloped an O(log n/log log n) approximation for it in general graphs, as well\nas an improved O(log^2 k) approximation in trees.

In the vicinity of fci, a\nspectral break is observed, like in solar wind turbulence. Above the break, the\nenergy of compressive and Alfvenic fluctuations generally follow a power law\nwith a spectral index between -3 and -2. Concerning the anisotropy of the wave\nvector distribution, we observe a change in its nature in the vicinity of ion\ncharacteristic scales: if at MHD scales there is no evidence for a dominance of\na slab (k||>kperp) or 2D (kperp>k||) turbulence, above the spectral break,\n(f>fci, kc/wpi>1) the 2D turbulence dominates. This 2D turbulence is observed\nin six selected one-hour intervals among which the average proton beta varies\nfrom 0.8 to 9. It is observed for both the transverse and compressive magnetic\nfluctuations, independently on the presence of linearly unstable modes at low\nfrequencies or Alfven vortices at the spectral break.

It is\nwell-known that the standard oracularization technique completely fails in some\nproof systems under the existence of prior entanglement. This paper studies two\nconstructions of two-prover one-round interactive proof systems based on\noracularization. First, it is proved that the two-prover one-round interactive\nproof system for PSPACE by Cai, Condon, and Lipton still achieves exponentially\nsmall soundness error in the existence of prior entanglement between dishonest\nprovers (and more strongly, even if dishonest provers are allowed to use\narbitrary no-signaling strategies). It follows that, unless the polynomial-time\nhierarchy collapses to the second level, two-prover systems are still\nadvantageous to single-prover systems even when only malicious provers can use\nquantum information. Second, it is proved that the two-prover one-round\ninteractive proof system obtained by oracularizing a three-query\nprobabilistically checkable proof system becomes sound in a weak sense even\nagainst dishonest entangled provers with the help of a dummy question. As a\nconsequence, every language in NEXP has a two-prover one-round interactive\nproof system of perfect completeness, albeit with exponentially small gap\nbetween completeness and soundness, in which each prover responds with only two\nbits. In other words, it is NP-hard to approximate within an inverse-polynomial\nthe value of a classical two-prover one-round game, even when provers are\nentangled and each sends a two-bit answer to a verifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2008 18:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-06"}

In contrast to the only other dSph star with similar\nabundance patterns, Dra 119, which has a very low metallicity at [Fe/H]=-2.95\ndex, our objects, at [Fe/H]~-2.0 dex, are only moderately metal poor.

The neutron capture deficiencies and the\n[Co/Fe] and [Cr/Fe] abundance ratios in our stars are similar to those in the\nextremely low metallicity Galactic halo.

If the algebra is commutative, the odd KP hierarchy is known to admit\nreductions to the BKP and the CKP hierarchy. We approach the odd KP hierarchy\nand its relation to BKP and CKP in different ways, and address the question\nwhether noncommutative versions of the BKP and the CKP equation (and some of\ntheir reductions) exist. In particular, we derive a functional representation\nof a linear system for the odd KP hierarchy, which in the commutative case\nproduces functional representations of the BKP and CKP hierarchies in terms of\na tau function.

A method to generate large\nclasses of exact solutions to the KP hierarchy from solutions to a linear\nmatrix ODE system, via a hierarchy of matrix Riccati equations, then also\napplies to the odd KP hierarchy, and this in turn can be exploited, in\nparticular, to obtain solutions to the BKP and CKP hierarchies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Oct 2008 11:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
