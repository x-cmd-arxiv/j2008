We use different tracers, such as Ha, ultraviolet (UV), and infrared\n(IR) emissions at various wavelengths, to study the dust and star-formation\n(SF) conditions throughout the disk of M33. Methods. We derive the radial\ndistribution of dust, of the old and young stellar population using Spitzer and\nGALEX data, complemented by ground-based optical data and available surveys of\natomic and molecular gas. We separate the contribution of discrete sources to\nthe IR brightness from the diffuse emission. Results. At 8 and 24 um, discrete\nsources account for 40% of the IR emission in the innermost 3 kpc, and for 20%\nfurther out. We find that stochastic emission from very small grains in the\ndiffuse interstellar medium accounts for only 10% of the diffuse 24 um\nemission, and that dusty circumstellar shells of unresolved, evolved AGB stars\n(carbon stars) are a viable alternative. The 8 um profile suggests that PAH\nemission declines faster with radius than the dust continuum. In annular\nregions, 0.24 kpc wide, we find a mean extinction value for stellar continuum\nAV = 0.25 mag with a weak dependence on radius, consistent with the shallow\nmetallicity gradient observed. Dust opacity derived from the 160 um emission\ndecreases instead by a factor 10 from the center to edge of the SF disk.\nConclusions.

Using spatial\ndynamics and a decomposition into separate Floquet eigenmodes, it is shown that\nthe linear evolution for the time-dependent operator can be represented using a\ncontour integral similar to that of the standard time-independent case. By\ndecomposing the resulting Green's distribution, the leading order behavior\nassociated with the embedded eigenvalues is extracted.

The methods with\nlocal adaptive metric provide the best phase-space estimators. They make use of\na Shannon entropy criterion combined with a binary tree partitioning and with\nSPH interpolation using 10-40 neighbours. Local scaling implemented by such\nmethods, which enforces local isotropy of the distribution function, can vary\nby about one order of magnitude in different regions within the system. It\npresents a bimodal distribution, in which one component is dominated by the\nmain part of the halo and the other one is dominated by the substructures.\nWhile potentially better than SPH techniques, since it yields an optimal\nestimate of the local softening volume (and the local number of neighbours\nrequired to perform the interpolation), the Delaunay tessellation in fact\npoorly estimates the phase-space distribution function. Indeed, it requires,\nthe choice of a global scaling S_G. We propose two methods to estimate S_G that\nyield a good global compromise.

Through this\nmechanism, the field would experience decoherence and appear more like a\nclassical distribution today; however the mechanism is not sufficiently\nefficient to explain classicality.

Approximation\nalgorithms for this problem were developed by Guha and Munagala by rounding a\nlinear program that couples the various alternatives together. In this paper we\npresent an index for this problem, which we call the ratio index, which also\nguarantees a constant factor approximation. Index-based policies have the\nadvantage that a single number (i.e. the index) can be computed for each\nalternative irrespective of all other alternatives, and the alternative with\nthe highest index is experimented upon. This is analogous to the famous Gittins\nindex for the discounted multi-armed bandit problem.\n  The ratio index has several interesting structural properties. First, we show\nthat it can be computed in strongly polynomial time. Second, we show that with\nthe appropriate discount factor, the Gittins index and our ratio index are\nconstant factor approximations of each other, and hence the Gittins index also\ngives a constant factor approximation to the budgeted learning problem.\nFinally, we show that the ratio index can be used to create an index-based\npolicy that achieves an O(1)-approximation for the finite horizon version of\nthe multi-armed bandit problem. Moreover, the policy does not require any\nknowledge of the horizon (whereas we compare its performance against an optimal\nstrategy that is aware of the horizon). This yields the following surprising\nresult: there is an index-based policy that achieves an O(1)-approximation for\nthe multi-armed bandit problem, oblivious to the underlying discount factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2008 01:37:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 18:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

Our purpose is to determine accurate theoretical amplitudes of solar g\nmodes and estimate the SOHO observation duration for an unambiguous detection.\nWe investigate the stochastic excitation of modes by turbulent convection as\nwell as their damping. Input from a 3D global simulation of the solar\nconvective zone is used for the kinetic turbulent energy spectrum. Damping is\ncomputed using a parametric description of the nonlocal time-dependent\nconvection-pulsation interaction. We then provide a theoretical estimation of\nthe intrinsic, as well as apparent, surface velocity. Asymptotic g-mode\nvelocity amplitudes are found to be orders of magnitude higher than previous\nworks. Using a 3D numerical simulation, from the ASH code, we attribute this to\nthe temporal-correlation between the modes and the turbulent eddies which is\nfound to follow a Lorentzian law rather than a Gaussian one as previously used.\nWe also find that damping rates of asymptotic gravity modes are dominated by\nradiative losses, with a typical life-time of $3 \\times 10^5$ years for the\n$\\ell=1$ mode at $\\nu=60 \\mu$Hz.

In this paper, we propose and\nvalidate by simulations an extension of the phase diversity technique that uses\nlong exposure adaptive optics corrected images for sensing quasi-static\naberrations during the scientific observation, in particular for high-contrast\nimaging. The principle of the method is that, for a sufficiently long exposure\ntime, the residual turbulence is averaged into a convolutive component of the\nimage and that phase diversity estimates the sole static aberrations of\ninterest. The advantages of such a procedure, compared to the processing of\nshort-exposure image pairs, are that the separation between static aberrations\nand turbulence-induced ones is performed by the long-exposure itself and not\nnumerically, that only one image pair must be processed, that the estimation\nbenefits from the high SNR of long-exposure images, and that only the static\naberrations of interest are to be estimated.

A prominent example of\nthis approach is the condensed matter scheme for quantum gravity, which\nconsiders the possibility that gravity emerges as an effective low-energy\nphenomenon from the quantum vacuum in a way similar to the emergence of\ncollective excitations in condensed matter systems. This condensed matter view\nof the quantum vacuum clearly hints that, while the term 'ether' has been\ndiscredited for about a century, quantum gravity holds many (if not all) of the\ncharacteristics that have led people in the past to label various hypothetical\nsubstances with the term 'ether'. Since the last burst of enthusiasm for an\nether, at the end of the 19th century, was brought to the grave in part by the\nperformance of a series of important experiments in interferometry, the\nsuggestion then naturally arises that maybe interferometry could also play a\nrole in the current discussion on quantum gravity. We will highlight some\naspects of this suggestion in the context of the condensed matter scheme for\nemergent gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2008 10:37:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2008 14:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-25"}

So far, quantum interfaces between light and\natoms have been demonstrated with atomic gases, and with single trapped atoms\nin cavities. Here we demonstrate the coherent and reversible mapping of a light\nfield with less than one photon per pulse onto an ensemble of 10 millions atoms\nnaturally trapped in a solid. This is achieved by coherently absorbing the\nlight field in a suitably prepared solid state atomic medium. The state of the\nlight is mapped onto collective atomic excitations on an optical transition and\nstored for a pre-programmed time up of to 1 mu s before being released in a\nwell defined spatio-temporal mode as a result of a collective interference. The\ncoherence of the process is verified by performing an interference experiment\nwith two stored weak pulses with a variable phase relation. Visibilities of\nmore than 95% are obtained, which demonstrates the high coherence of the\nmapping process at the single photon level. In addition, we show experimentally\nthat our interface allows one to store and retrieve light fields in multiple\ntemporal modes.

In\nphotometry, a broad, bright (M_R~-21.7) peak characterizes all BVRI light\ncurves. Afterwards, a rapid luminosity fading is followed by a phase of slow\nluminosity decline between day ~170 and ~237. At late phases (>237 days),\nbecause of the large luminosity drop (>3 mag), only upper visibility limits are\nobtained in the B, R and I bands. In the near-infrared, two K-band detections\non days 411 and 510 open new issues about dust formation or IR echoes\nscenarios. At all epochs the spectra are characterized by the absence of broad\nP-Cygni profiles and a multicomponent Halpha profile, which are the typical\nsignatures of type IIn SNe. After maximum, spectroscopic and photometric\nsimilarities are found between SN 2006gy and bright, interaction-dominated SNe\n(e.g. SN 1997cy, SN 1999E and SN 2002ic). This suggests that ejecta-CSM\ninteraction plays a key role in SN 2006gy about 6 to 8 months after maximum,\nsustaining the late-time-light curve. Alternatively, the late luminosity may be\nrelated to the radioactive decay of ~3M_sun of 56Ni. Models of the light curve\nin the first 170 days suggest that the progenitor was a compact star (R~6-8\n10^(12)cm, M_ej~5-14M_sun), and that the SN ejecta collided with massive\n(6-10M_sun), opaque clumps of previously ejected material. These clumps do not\ncompletely obscure the SN photosphere, so that at its peak the luminosity is\ndue both to the decay of 56Ni and to interaction with CSM. A supermassive star\nis not required to explain the observational data, nor is an extra-ordinarily\nlarge explosion energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2008 14:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The\nacceleration of particles relies on interactions between energetic particles\nand magnetic turbulence. In the case of SNRs we can perform spatially resolved\nstudies in systems with known geometry, and the plasma physics deduced from\nthese observations will help us to understand other systems where rapid\nparticle acceleration is believed to occur and where observations as detailed\nas those of SNRs are not possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2008 15:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-06"}
