Methods: iCosmo is a software package\nto perform interactive cosmological calculations for the low redshift universe.\nComputing distance measures, the matter power spectrum, and the growth factor\nis supported for any values of the cosmological parameters. It also computes\nderived observed quantities for several cosmological probes such as cosmic\nshear, baryon acoustic oscillations and type Ia supernovae. The associated\nerrors for these observables can be derived for customised surveys, or for\npre-set values corresponding to current or planned instruments. The code also\nallows for the calculation of cosmological forecasts with Fisher matrices which\ncan be manipulated to combine different surveys and cosmological probes. The\ncode is written in the IDL language and thus benefits from the convenient\ninteractive features and scientific library available in this language. iCosmo\ncan also be used as an engine to perform cosmological calculations in batch\nmode, and forms a convenient adaptive platform for the development of further\ncosmological modules. With its extensive documentation, it may also serve as a\nuseful resource for teaching and for newcomers in the field of cosmology.\nResults: The iCosmo package is described with various examples and command\nsequences.

It is\nproved that the proposed discontinuous Galerkin methods are stable (hence\nwell-posed) without any mesh constraint. For each fixed wave number $k$,\noptimal order (with respect to $h$) error estimate in the broken $H^1$-norm and\nsub-optimal order estimate in the $L^2$-norm are derived without any mesh\nconstraint. The latter estimate improves to optimal order when the mesh size\n$h$ is restricted to the preasymptotic regime (i.e., $k^2 h \\gtrsim 1$).\nNumerical experiments are also presented to gauge the theoretical result and to\nnumerically examine the pollution effect (with respect to $k$) in the error\nbounds.

To overcome the difficulty caused by the strong\nnonlinearity, we first formulate (at the differential level) a vanishing moment\napproximation of the semigeostrophic flow equations, a methodology recently\nproposed by the authors \\cite{Feng1,Feng2}, which involves approximating the\nfully nonlinear Monge-Amp\\'ere equation by a family of fourth order quasilinear\nequations. We then construct a fully discrete modified characteristic finite\nelement method for the regularized problem. It is shown that under certain mesh\nand time stepping constraints, the proposed numerical method converges with an\noptimal order rate of convergence. In particular, the obtained error bounds\nshow explicit dependence on the regularization parameter $\\vepsi$. Numerical\ntests are also presented to validate the theoretical results and to gauge the\nefficiency of the proposed fully discrete modified characteristic finite\nelement method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2008 16:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-09"}

There are two such charged states in this scenario with couplings to\nlight quarks and leptons being suppressed relative to those in the SM, whereas\nthe couplings to top/bottom quarks are enhanced, similar to the case of\nelectroweak neutral gauge bosons previously studied.

All of\nour Suzaku observations (one, by design) occurred at or very near orbital phase\n0 (superior conjunction), and hence show evolution in color-color diagrams due\nto X-ray absorption by material from the wind of the secondary.

Both are required for the Suzaku data, and are seen to be\nconsistent with the RXTE data. These Suzaku observations occurred near\nhistorically hard, low flux states. We present fits of the broad band spectra\nwith a simple phenomenological broken powerlaw model, as well as a more\nphysically motivated Comptonization model.

We\nthen move on to a discussion of static, spherically symmetric braneworld black\nhole solutions. Assuming an equation of state for the ``Weyl term'', which\nencodes the effects of the extra dimension, we are able to classify the general\nbehaviour of these solutions. We then use the strong field limit approach to\ninvestigate the gravitational lensing properties of some candidate braneworld\nblack hole solutions. It is found that braneworld black holes could have\nsignificantly different observational signatures to the Schwarzschild black\nhole of standard general relativity. Rotating braneworld black hole solutions\nare also discussed, and we attempt to generate rotating solutions from known\nstatic solutions using the Newman-Janis complexification ``trick''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2008 20:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-10"}

The data available for low-mass stars have yielded firm evidence that\nstellar structure models predict smaller radii and higher effective\ntemperatures than observed, but the number of systems with detailed analyses is\nstill small. In this paper we present a complete reanalysis of one of such\neclipsing systems, CM Dra, composed of two dM4.5 stars. New and existing light\ncurves as well as a radial velocity curve are modeled to measure the physical\nproperties of both components. The masses and radii determined for the\ncomponents of CM Dra are M1=0.2310+/-0.0009 Msun, M2=0.2141+/-0.0010 Msun,\nR1=0.2534+/-0.0019 Rsun, and R2=0.2396+/-0.0015 Rsun. With relative\nuncertainties well below the 1% level, these values constitute the most\naccurate properties to date for fully convective stars. This makes CM Dra a\nvaluable benchmark for testing theoretical models. In comparing our\nmeasurements with theory, we confirm the discrepancies reported previously for\nother low-mass eclipsing binaries. These discrepancies seem likely to be due to\nthe effects of magnetic activity. We find that the orbit of this system is\nslightly eccentric, and we have made use of eclipse timings spanning three\ndecades to infer the apsidal motion and other related properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2008 21:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It\nmay be an X-ray reflection nebula where the X-rays from previous Galactic\nCenter (GC) activity are reflected by a molecular cloud. This result further\nstrengthens the assumption that the molecular cloud which is spatially\ncoincident with region A of HESS J1745-303 is located in the GC region. The TeV\nemission from molecular clouds is reminiscent of the diffuse TeV gamma-rays\nfrom the GC giant molecular clouds, and it could have the same emission\nmechanism. With deep exposure mapping observations by Suzaku, a tight\nupper-limit on the 2-10 keV continuum diffuse emission from region A is\nobtained, as 2.1x10^-13ergs s^-1cm^-2. The flux ratio between 1-10 TeV and 2-10\nkeV is larger than 4. Possible scenarios to reproduce wide-band spectra from\nkeV to TeV are examined. Thermal X-rays from nearby two old supernova remnants,\nG359.0-0.9 and G359.1-0.5, are detected, and their emission properties are well\ndetermined in the present study with deep exposure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2008 07:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Previously,\nthe coincidence of this source with both the shell-type supernova remnant (SNR)\nW41 and a giant molecular cloud (GMC) was interpreted as favoring pi^0-decay\ngamma-rays from interaction of the old SNR with the GMC. Alternatively, the TeV\nemission has been attributed to inverse Compton scattering from leptons\ndeposited by PSR J1833-0827, a pulsar assumed to have been born in W41 but now\nlocated 24' from the center of the SNR (and the TeV source). Instead, we argue\nfor a third possibility, that the TeV emission is powered by a previously\nunknown pulsar wind nebula located near the center of W41. The candidate pulsar\nis XMMU J183435.3-084443, a hard X-ray point source that lacks an optical\ncounterpart to R>21 and is coincident with diffuse X-ray emission. The X-rays\nfrom both the point source and diffuse feature are evidently non-thermal and\nhighly absorbed. A best fit power-law model yields photon index Gamma ~ 0.2 and\nGamma ~ 1.9, for the point source and diffuse emission, respectively, and 2-10\nkeV flux ~ 5 X 10^(-13) ergs/cm^(2)/s for each. At the measured 4 kpc distance\nof W41, the observed X-ray luminosity implies an energetic pulsar with Edot ~\n10^(36)d_4^2 ergs/s, which is also sufficient to generate the observed\ngamma-ray luminosity of 2.7 X 10^(34)d_4^2 ergs/s via inverse Compton\nscattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2008 09:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Additional ground based spectra (UKIRT/UIST) were obtained to further\nconstrain the H$_2$ excitation along the jet axis and, combined with the 0--0\nlines, have been compared with bow-shock models. From the different line\nratios, we find that the atomic gas is characterized by an electron density n_e\n~ 200-1000 cm^{-3}, a temperature T_e < 2500 K and an ionization fraction <~\n10^{-2}; the excitation conditions of the atomic jet are thus very different\nfrom those found in more evolved Class I and Class II jets.

In this paper, we examine the utility of anonymized flow\ntraces for anomaly detection.

Specifically, we analyze three weeks of\nun-sampled and non-anonymized network traces from a medium-sized backbone\nnetwork. We find that all anonymization techniques, except prefix-preserving\npermutation, degrade the utility of data for anomaly detection.

M stars are used because they show\nH_alpha emission until a particular age which is a well calibrated function of\ntheir absolute magnitudes. This allows us to reconstruct the rate at which disk\nstars have been born over about half the disk's lifetime. Our star formation\nrate agrees well with those obtained by using other, independent, methods and\nseems to rule out a constant star formation rate.\n  The principal result of this study is to show that a relation of the\nSchmidt-Kennicut type (which relates the star formation rate to the\ninterstellar gas content of galaxy disks) has pertained in the Milky Way disk\nduring the last 5 Gyr. The star formation rate we derive from the M dwarfs and\nthe interstellar gas content of the disk can be inferred as a function of time\nfrom a model of the chemical enrichment of the disk, which is well constrained\nby the observations indicating that the metallicity of the Galactic disk has\nremained nearly constant over the timescales involved.

During the observation\nperiod, the source was in optical decrease following a flaring event monitored\nby the GLAST-AGILE Support Program (GASP) of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope\n(WEBT). The simultaneous gamma-ray, optical, and radio coverage allows us to\nstudy the spectral energy distribution and the theoretical models based on the\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) emission mechanisms. AGILE observed the\nsource with its two co-aligned imagers, the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector and the\nhard X-ray imager Super-AGILE sensitive in the 30 MeV - 50 GeV and 18 - 60 keV\nbands, respectively. Between 23 and 27 August 2007, AGILE detected gamma-ray\nemission from PKS 1510-089 when this source was located about 50 degrees\noff-axis, with an average flux of (270 +/- 65) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}\nfor photon energy above 100 MeV. In the following period, 28 August - 1\nSeptember, after a satellite re-pointing, AGILE detected the source at about 35\ndegrees off-axis, with an average flux (E > 100 MeV) of (195 +/- 30) x 10^{-8}\nphotons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. No emission was detected by Super-AGILE, with a 3-sigma\nupper limit of 45 mCrab in 200 ksec. The spectral energy distribution is\nmodelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self Compton (SSC) emission\nplus contributions by external photons: the SSC emission contributes primarily\nto the X-ray band, whereas the contribution of the IC from the external disc\nand the broad line region match the hard gamma-ray spectrum observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2008 15:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Sersic functions fit them remarkably well. Effective brightnesses and\nradii are derived via Sersic fits and by integrating the profiles\nnonparametrically. We strongly confirm two dichotomies: (1) Elliptical galaxies\nfrom cDs to M32 form a tight sequence in Fundamental Plane parameter space that\nis almost perpendicular to the sequence of spheroidal galaxies from NGC 205 to\nDraco. This is consistent with our understanding of their different formation\nprocesses: mergers for Es and conversion of late-type galaxies into spheroidals\nby environmental effects and by energy feedback from supernovae. (2)\nEllipticals come in two varieties: e.g., our 10 brightest Es have cuspy cores;\nour 17 fainter Es do not have cores. We find a new distinct component in\ncoreless Es. All have extra light at the center above the inward extrapolation\nof the outer Sersic profile. We suggest that extra light is made by starbursts\nin dissipational (wet) mergers, as in numerical simulations. Three other new\naspects also point to an explanation of how the E-E dichotomy formed: extra\nlight Es were made in wet mergers while core Es were made in dry mergers. We\nconfirm that core Es do and extra light Es generally do not contain X-ray gas.\nThis suggests why the E-E dichotomy arose. Only core Es and their progenitors\nare massive enough to retain hot gas that can make dry mergers dry and protect\nold star populations from late star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2008 15:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
