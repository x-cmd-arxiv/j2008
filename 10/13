We report the detection by the AGILE satellite of an intense\ngamma-ray flare from the gamma-ray source 3EG J1255-0549, associated to the\nFlat Spectrum Radio Quasar 3C 279, during the AGILE pointings towards the Virgo\nRegion on 2007 July 9-13.\n  Aims. The simultaneous optical, X-ray and gamma-ray covering allows us to\nstudy the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the theoretical models\nrelative to the flaring episode of mid-July.\n  Methods. AGILE observed the source during its Science Performance\nVerification Phase with its two co-aligned imagers: the Gamma- Ray Imaging\nDetector (GRID) and the hard X-ray imager (Super-AGILE) sensitive in the 30 MeV\n- 50 GeV and 18 - 60 keV respectively. During the AGILE observation the source\nwas monitored simultaneously in optical band by the REM telescope and in the\nX-ray band by the Swift satellite through 4 ToO observations.\n  Results. During 2007 July 9-13 July 2007, AGILE-GRID detected gamma-ray\nemission from 3C 279, with the source at ~2 deg from the center of the Field of\nView, with an average flux of (210+-38) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for energy above\n100 MeV. No emission was detected by Super-AGILE, with a 3-sigma upper limit of\n10 mCrab. During the observation lasted about 4 days no significative gamma-ray\nflux variation was observed.\n  Conclusions. The Spectral Energy Distribution is modelled with a homogeneous\none-zone Synchrotron Self Compton emission plus the contributions by external\nCompton scattering of direct disk radiation and, to a lesser extent, by\nexternal Compton scattering of photons from the Broad Line Region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 09:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

We discuss, for this framework, the\nhydrodynamics of the shear mode in generalized theories of gravity in d+1\ndimensions. It is shown that the shear diffusion coefficients of the\nnear-horizon and boundary hydrodynamics are equal and can be expressed in a\nform that is purely local to the horizon. We find that the Einstein-theory\nrelation between the shear diffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity to\nentropy ratio is modified for generalized gravity theories: Both can be\nexplicitly written as the ratio of a pair of polarization-specific\ngravitational couplings but implicate differently polarized gravitons.

In particular, we are interested in the physical consequences of a\n\"small\" departure from a physically sensible configuration. The obtained\nsolutions smoothly depend on free parameters. By setting these parameters to\nzero, the starting seed solution is regained. We apply our procedure in detail\nby taking as seed solutions the Florides metrics, and the Tolman IV solution.\nWe show that the chosen Tolman IV, and also Heint IIa Durg IV,V perfect fluid\nsolutions, can be used to generate a class of parametric solutions where the\nanisotropic factor has features recalling boson stars. This is an indication\nthat boson stars could emerge by \"perturbing\" appropriately a perfect fluid\nsolution (at least for the seed metrics considered). Finally, starting with\nTolman IV, Heint IIa and Durg IV,V solutions, we build anisotropic\ngravastar-like sources with the appropriate boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 11:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 11:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-17"}

The mobility of H atoms on the surface of interstellar dust grains at\nlow temperature is still a matter of debate. In dense clouds, the hydrogenation\nof adsorbed species (i.e., CO), as well as the subsequent deuteration of the\naccreted molecules depend on the mobility of H atoms on water ice.\nAstrochemical models widely assume that H atoms are mobile on the surface of\ndust grains even if controversy still exists. We present here direct\nexperimental evidence of the mobility of H atoms on porous water ice surfaces\nat 10 K. Methods. In a UHV chamber, O2 is deposited on a porous amorphous water\nice substrate. Then D atoms are deposited onto the surface held at 10 K.\nTemperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD) is used and desorptions of O2 and D2\nare simultaneously monitored. Results.

A simple rate\nequation model fits our experimental data and best fit curves were obtained for\na D atoms diffusion barrier of 22(+-)2 meV.

The purpose of this paper is to\ndefine a simple galaxy classification cube, using a carefully selected sample\nof around 1000 galaxies. Methods. Using medium resolution spectra of the first\n1k zCOSMOS-bright sample, optical photometry from the Subaru/COSMOS\nobservations, and morphological measurements derived from ACS imaging, we\nanalyze the properties of the galaxy population out to z~1. Applying three\nstraightforward classification schemes (spectral, photometric, and\nmorphological), we identify two main galaxy types, which appear to be linked to\nthe bimodality of galaxy population. The three parametric classifications\nconstitute the axes of a \"classification cube\". Results. A very good agreement\nexists between the classification from spectral data (quiescent/star-forming\ngalaxies) and that based on colours (red/blue galaxies). The third parameter\n(morphology) is less well correlated with the first two: in fact a good\ncorrelation between the spectral classification and that based on morphological\nanalysis (early-/late-type galaxies) is achieved only after partially\ncomplementing the morphological classification with additional colour\ninformation. Finally, analyzing the 3D-distribution of all galaxies in the\nsample, we find that about 85% of the galaxies show a fully concordant\nclassification, being either quiescent, red, bulge-dominated galaxies (~20%) or\nstar-forming, blue, disk-dominated galaxies (~65%). These results imply that\nthe galaxy bimodality is a consistent behaviour both in morphology, colour and\ndominant stellar population, at least out to z~1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 14:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this work we aim at\ndemonstrating how ground based observations can reach the required resolution\nwhen using Multi-Conjugated Adaptive Optic (MCAO) devices in the NIR, such as\nthe experimental infrared camera (MAD) available on the VLT. This is\nparticularly important since these corrections are planned to be available on\nall ground--based telescopes in the near future.

From the analysis of the external field,\nobserved with better seeing conditions, we derived the deepest optical-NIR CMD\nof NGC 6388 to date. The high-precision photometry reveals that two distinct\nsub-giant branches are clearly present in this cluster.

Particular cases arise from Riemannian submersions when the\noperators are Laplace-Beltrami operators, from equivariant operators on the\ntotal space of a principal bundle, and for the operators on the diffeomorphism\ngroup arising from stochastic flows. Classical non-linear filtering problems\nalso lead to such conffigurations. A basic tool is the, possibly, non-linear\n\"semi-connection\" induced by this set up, leading to a canonical decomposition\nof the operator on the domain space. Topics discussed include: generalised\nWietzenbock curvatures arising in the equivariant case, skew -product\ndecompositions of diffusion processes, conditioned processes, classical\nfiltering, decomposition of stochastic flows, and connections determined by\nstochastic differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 15:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-22"}

We study the structure and\nstability of Mg$_x$TM$_{1-x}$H$_2$ compounds, $x=[0$-1], by first-principles\ncalculations at the level of density functional theory. We find that the\nexperimentally observed sharp decrease in hydrogenation rates for $x\\gtrsim0.8$\ncorrelates with a phase transition of Mg$_x$TM$_{1-x}$H$_2$ from a fluorite to\na rutile phase. The stability of these compounds decreases along the series Sc,\nTi, V, Cr. Varying the transition metal (TM) and the composition $x$, the\nformation enthalpy of Mg$_x$TM$_{1-x}$H$_2$ can be tuned over the substantial\nrange 0-2 eV/f.u. Assuming however that the alloy Mg$_x$TM$_{1-x}$ does not\ndecompose upon dehydrogenation, the enthalpy associated with reversible\nhydrogenation of compounds with a high magnesium content ($x=0.75$) is close to\nthat of pure Mg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 15:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-04"}
