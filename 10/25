In measurement-based\nquantum computing (MBQC), the need for a highly entangled initial state is\nparticularly obvious. Defying this intuition, we show that quantum states can\nbe too entangled to be useful for the purpose of computation. We prove that\nthis phenomenon occurs for a dramatic majority of all states: the fraction of\nuseful n-qubit pure states is less than exp(-n^2). Computational universality\nis hence a rare property in quantum states. This work highlights a new aspect\nof the question concerning the role entanglement plays for quantum\ncomputational speed-ups. The statements remain true if one allows for certain\nforms of post-selection and also cover the notion of CQ-universality. We\nidentify scale-invariant states resulting from a MERA construction as likely\ncandidates for physically relevant states subject to this effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 19:27:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2008 12:09:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 May 2009 10:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this context, SN2008D\nassociated with XT080109 could represent a paradigmatic case, since it might\nexemplify a potential borderline event. The main aim is to infer geometric\ninformation of SN2008D through the evolution of its linear optical\npolarization. We also report the polarization evolution of SN2007uy, and\ndiscuss the properties of the host ISM towards the XT. The final goal is to\ncompare the polarization properties, and hence the geometries of both SNe,\nwhich shone contemporaneously in NGC2770. This fortunate coincidence brought us\nthe opportunity to observe both SNe simultaneously, and most importantly, with\nidentical instrumental setups. The observations span 74.9 days, starting 3.6\ndays after the XT and are distributed in 11 visits. In addition we performed\nobservations in the mm range in order to identify the dominant polarization. We\nreport positive linear polarization detections at several epochs for SN2008D at\na level of ~1% and at ~1.5% for SN2007uy. SN2007uy shows constant polarization,\nwhich could be described by the host interstellar polarization plus a constant\neccentricity expansion on the sky plane. A statistical analysis of the\ndistribution of the SN2008D Stokes parametres suggests that it could show an\nintrinsic variable polarization component. Assuming the SN2007uy polarization\nis constant, we find that the evolution of the intrinsic SN2008D polarization\ncould be explained by an aspherical axisymmetric expansion with variable\neccentricity. We come to the same result even if we make no assumption on\nSN2007uy, although at a lower significance level.

Eliashberg's\ncharacterization of manifolds admitting Stein structures requires an extra\ndelicate hypothesis in complex dimension 2, which can be eliminated by passing\nto the topological setting and invoking Freedman theory. The situation is quite\nsimilar if one asks which open subsets of a fixed complex manifold can be made\nStein by an isotopy. As an application of these theorems, one can construct\nuncountably many diffeomorphism types of exotic R^4's realized as Stein open\nsubsets of C^2 (i.e. domains of holomorphy). More generally, every domain of\nholomorphy in C^2 is topologically isotopic to other such domains realizing\nuncountably many diffeomorphism types. Any tame n-complex in a complex\nn-manifold can be isotoped to become a nested intersection of Stein open\nsubsets, provided the isotopy is topological when n=2. In the latter case, the\nStein neighborhoods are homeomorphic, but frequently realize uncountably many\ndiffeomorphism types. It is also proved that every exhausting Morse function\ncan be subdivided to yield a locally finite handlebody of the same maximal\nindex, both in the context of smooth n-manifolds and for Stein surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 17:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-29"}

The velocities and trajectories of\nrepresentative outgoing, ingoing, and stationary classical particles are\ncalculated and contrasted, and the dynamics of simple quantum fields (both\nmassless and massive) on the space-time are examined. Invariant densities\nassociated with the quantum fields are exhibited on the Penrose diagram that\nrepresents the excreting black hole.\n  Furthermore, a generic approach for the consistent mutual gravitation of\nquanta in a manner that reproduces the given geometry is developed. The\ndynamics of the mutually gravitating quantum fields are expressed in terms of\nthe affine parameter that describes local motions of a given quantum type on\nthe space-time. Algebraic equations that relate the energy-momentum densities\nof the quantum fields to Einstein's tensor can then be developed. An example\nmutually gravitating system of macroscopically coherent quanta along with a\ncore gravitating field is demonstrated. Since the approach is generic and\nalgebraic, it can be used to represent a variety of systems with specified\nboundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 17:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-19"}

The spectral energy distribution (SED) of\nthe debris system implies a complex structure. A model constrained by the\nsurface brightness profiles and the SED indicates that the sub-mm ring emission\nis primarily from large (a ~ 135 um) grains, with smaller (a ~ 15 um) grains\nalso present in and beyond the ring. The Spitzer IRS and MIPS SED-mode\nspectrophotometry data clearly show the presence of spatially compact excess\nemission at lambda > 15 um that requires the presence of two additional narrow\nbelts of dust within the sub-mm ring's central void. The innermost belt at r ~\n3 AU is composed of silicate dust. A simple dynamical model suggests that dust\nproduced collisionally by a population of about 11 M_Earth of planetesimals in\nthe sub-mm ring could be the source of the emission from both in and beyond the\nsub-mm ring. Maintaining the inner belts and the inner edge to the sub-mm ring\nmay require the presence of three planets in this system including the\ncandidate radial velocity object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 22:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Many models relate the\ncircumstellar environment to observable polarization changes across spectral\nlines. However, measuring signals at the 0.1% level requires a very careful\ncontrol of systematic effects.\n  We have recently built a high-resolution spectropolarimeter for the HiVIS\nspectrograph on the 3.67m AEOS telescope and have obtained a large number of\nhigh precision spectropolarimetric observations of Herbig Ae/Be, Classical Be\nand other stars. The detected linear polarization varies from our typical\ndetection threshold near 0.1% up to 2%. This polarization effect is generally\nnot coincident with the H-alpha emission peak but is detected only in the\nabsorptive part of the line profile and varies with the absorption. These\ndetections are largely inconsistent with the traditional scattering models and\ninspired a new explanation of their polarization.\n  We developed a new spectropolarimetric model and argue that polarization in\nabsorption is evidence of optical pumping. We argue that, while scattering\ntheory fits many Be and emission-line star observations, this new theory has\nmuch more potential to explain polarization-in-absorption as seen in Herbig\nAe/Be and other stellar systems.\n  This thesis presents a large spectropolarimetric study that combines new\ninstrumentation, custom processing software, thorough calibrations,\ncross-instrument comparisons, a massive observing campaign on many targets,\ncomparison of current theories on multiple objects and finally the creation of\na new theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2008 21:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-28"}

This suggests that, contrary\nto current beliefs, the corona of the HSS and that of the LHS could be of very\nsimilar nature.

Besides formation of\nlanes of uniform walking direction and oscillations at bottlenecks at moderate\ndensities, it was recently discovered that stop-and-go waves [D. Helbing et\nal., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 168001 (2006)] and a phenomenon called \"crowd\nturbulence\" can occur at high pedestrian densities [D. Helbing et al., Phys.\nRev. E 75, 046109 (2007)]. Although the behavior of pedestrian crowds under\nextreme conditions is decisive for the safety of crowds during the access to or\negress from mass events as well as for situations of emergency evacuation,\nthere is still a lack of empirical studies of extreme crowding. Therefore, this\npaper discusses how one may study high-density conditions based on suitable\nvideo data. This is illustrated at the example of pilgrim flows entering the\nprevious Jamarat Bridge in Mina, 5 kilometers from the Holy Mosque in Makkah,\nSaudi-Arabia. Our results reveal previously unexpected pattern formation\nphenomena and show that the average individual speed does not go to zero even\nat local densities of 10 persons per square meter. Since the maximum density\nand flow are different from measurements in other countries, this has\nimplications for the capacity assessment and dimensioning of facilities for\nmass events. When conditions become congested, the flow drops significantly,\nwhich can cause stop-and-go waves and a further increase of the density until\ncritical crowd conditions are reached. Then, \"crowd turbulence\" sets in, which\nmay trigger crowd disasters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2008 09:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-28"}

The model is\none of the realistic extensions of the gauge mediation model with\nsuperconformal hidden sector. It is shown that the extension is applicable for\na broad range of conformality breaking scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2008 15:16:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2009 07:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-21"}

The principal assumptions are the existence of a lower bound for\nthe ergodic averages of the transition probability function and its local\nuniform continuity. The latter is called the e-property. The general result is\napplied to solutions of some stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces.\nAs an example, we consider an evolution equation whose solution describes the\nLagrangian observations of the velocity field in the passive tracer model. The\nweak-$^*$ mean ergodicity of the corresponding invariant measure is used to\nderive the law of large numbers for the trajectory of a tracer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2008 14:42:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 2008 03:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 May 2009 12:35:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 10:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-19"}
