Cosmic\nray spectra from ATIC and PAMELA require a WIMP with mass M_chi ~ 500 - 800 GeV\nthat annihilates into leptons at a level well above that expected from a\nthermal relic. Signals from WMAP and EGRET reinforce this interpretation. Taken\ntogether, we argue these facts imply the presence of a GeV-scale new force in\nthe dark sector. The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the\nannihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak scale\nannihilation cross section during dark matter freezeout in the early universe.\nIf the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier, phi, its low mass\ncan force it to decay dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a\nnon-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and\nsplittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m_phi ~\nMeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to\nexplain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the\nINTEGRAL satellite. Somewhat smaller splittings would also be expected,\nproviding a natural source for the parameters of the inelastic dark matter\n(iDM) explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Since the Sommerfeld\nenhancement is most significant at low velocities, early dark matter halos at\nredshift ~10 potentially produce observable effects on the ionization history\nof the universe, and substructure is more detectable than with a conventional\nWIMP. Moreover, the low velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies and Milky Way\nsubhalos can greatly increase the substructure annihilation signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 19:59:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 21:49:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2009 06:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-26"}

The WIMP is taken to be\ncharged under a hidden gauge symmetry G_Dark, broken near the GeV scale; this\nalso provides the necessary ingredients for the \"exciting\" and \"inelastic\" Dark\nMatter interpretations of the INTEGRAL and DAMA signals. In this short note we\npoint out the consequences of the most straightforward embedding of this simple\npicture within low-energy SUSY, in which G_Dark breaking at the GeV scale\narises naturally through radiative corrections, or Planck-suppressed operators.\nThe theory predicts major additions to SUSY signals at the LHC. A completely\ngeneric prediction is that G_Dark particles can be produced in cascade decays\nof MSSM superpartners, since these end with pairs of MSSM LSP's that in turn\ndecay into the true LSP and other particles in the dark sector. In turn, the\nlightest GeV-scale dark Higgses and gauge bosons eventually decay back into\nlight SM states, and dominantly into leptons. Therefore, a large fraction of\nall SUSY events will contain at least two ``lepton jets'': collections of n>= 2\nleptons, with small angular separations and GeV scale invariant masses.\nFurthermore, if the Dark Matter sector is directly charged under the Standard\nModel, the success of gauge coupling unification implies the presence of new\nlong-lived colored particles that can be copiously produced at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 19:54:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 03:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}

The main challenge in identifying energetic top quarks is that the\ndecay products become increasingly collimated. This reduces the efficacy of\nconventional methods that exploit the topology of the top decay chain. We focus\non the cases where the decay products of the top quark are reconstructed as a\nsingle jet, a \"top-jet\". The most basic \"top-tag\" method based on jet mass\nmeasurement is considered in detail. To analyze the top-tagging method,\ntheoretical and experimental aspects of the QCD jet background are examined.\nBased on QCD factorization, we derive a simple analytic approximation for the\nshape of the QCD jet mass spectrum. We observe a good agreement with the Monte\nCarlo simulation. We consider high-p_T t\\bar{t} production in the Standard\nModel as an example, and show that our theoretical QCD jet mass distributions\ncan efficiently characterize the background via sideband analyses. We show that\nwith 25 fb^{-1} of data, our approach allows us to resolve top-jets with p_T\n$\\ge$ 1 TeV from the QCD background, and about 1.5 TeV top-jets with 100\nfb^{-1}, without relying on b-tagging. To further improve the significance we\nconsider jet shapes (analyzed in 0807.0234 [hep-ph]), which resolve the\nsubstructure of energy flow inside cone jets. A method of measuring top quark\npolarization by using the b-quark p_T is also presented. The main advantages of\nour approach are: (i) the mass distributions are driven by first principle\ncalculations, instead of relying solely on Monte Carlo simulation; (ii) for\nhigh p_T jets (p_T $\\ge$1 TeV), IR-safe jet shape variables are robust against\ndetector resolution effects. Our analysis is applicable to other boosted\nmassive particles such as the electroweak gauge bosons and the Higgs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 19:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-11"}

When no treatment\nis applied the model reproduces the typical dynamics of early tumor growth. The\ninitially avascular tumor reaches a diffusion limited size of the order of\nmillimeters and initiates angiogenesis through the release of vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by hypoxic cells in the core of the\ntumor. This stimulates endothelial cells to migrate towards the tumor and\nestablishes a nutrient supply sufficient for sustained invasion. To this model\nwe apply cytostatic treatment in the form of a VEGF-inhibitor, which reduces\nthe proliferation and chemotaxis of endothelial cells. This treatment has the\ncapability to reduce tumor mass, but more importantly, we were able to\ndetermine that inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation is the more\nimportant of the two cellular functions targeted by the drug. Further, we\nconsidered the application of a cytotoxic drug that targets proliferating tumor\ncells. The drug was treated as a diffusible substance entering the tissue from\nthe blood vessels.

So, we suppose\nthat in a definite micro-physical context (including other interacting\nparticles), each particle is enfolded by a probability field whose existence is\ncontingent upon the existence of the particle, but it can locally affect the\nphysical status of the particle in a context-dependent manner. The dynamics of\nthe whole particle-field system obeys deterministic equations in a manner that\nwhen the particle is subjected to a conservative force, the field also\nexperiences a conservative complex force which its form is determined by the\ndynamics of particle. So, the field is endowed with a given amount of energy,\nbut its value is contingent upon the physical conditions the particle is\nsubjected to. Based on the energy balance of the particle and its associated\nfield, we argue why the field has a probabilistic objective nature. In such a\nway, the basic elements of this new formulation, its application for some\nstationary states and its nonlinear generalization for conservative systems are\ndiscussed here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 18:13:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 20:03:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 08:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}

We find\nthat radio-detected LRGs (with optical luminosities of 3-5L* and 1.4GHz radio\npowers between 1e24 and 1e26 W/Hz) are significantly more clustered than a\nmatched sample of radio-quiet LRGs with the same distribution in optical\nluminosity and colour. The measured scale length of the 2pt auto-correlation\nfunction, r0, is 12.3+/-1.2 1/h Mpc and 9.02+/-0.52 1/h Mpc for the\nradio-detected and radio-quiet samples respectively. Using the halo model\nframework we demonstrate that the radio-loud LRGs have typical halo masses of\n10.1+/-1.4 x10^13 1/h M_sun compared to 6.44+/-0.32 x10^13 1/h M_sun for the\nradio-quiet sample. A model in which the radio-detected LRGs are almost all\ncentral galaxies within haloes provides the best fit, and we estimate that at\nleast 30% of LRGs with the same clustering amplitude as the radio-detected LRGs\nare currently radio-loud. Our results imply that radio-loud LRGs typically\noccupy more massive haloes than other LRGs of the same optical luminosity, so\nthe probability of finding a radio-loud AGN in a massive galaxy at z~0.55 is\ninfluenced by the halo mass in addition to the dependence on optical\nluminosity. If we model the radio-loud fraction of LRGs, F_rad, as a function\nof halo mass M, then the data are well-fitted by a power law of the form F_rad\n\\propto M^(0.65+/-0.23). The relationship between radio emission and clustering\nstrength could arise either through a higher fuelling rate of gas onto the\ncentral black holes of galaxies in the most massive haloes (producing more\npowerful radio jets) or through the presence of a denser IGM (providing a more\nefficient working surface for the jets, thus boosting their radio luminosity).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 20:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The fiducial simulation combines\na total-energy-conserving formulation with a radiative cooling function, which\nincludes bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and Compton effects. By comparison with\nother simulations we show that in optically thin advection-dominated accretion\nflows, radiative cooling can significantly affect the structure, without\nnecessarily leading to an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk.\nWe further compare the results of our radiatively-cooled simulation to the\npredictions of a previously developed analytic model for such flows. For the\nvery low stress parameter and accretion rate found in our simulated disk, we\nclosely match a state called the \"transition\" solution between an outer\nadvection-dominated accretion flow and what would be a magnetically-dominated\naccretion flow (MDAF) in the interior. The qualitative and quantitative\nagreement between the numerical and analytic models is quite good, with only a\nfew well-understood exceptions. According to the analytic model then, at\nsignificantly higher stress or accretion, we would expect a full MDAF to form.\nThe collection of simulations in this work also provide important data for\ninterpreting other numerical results in the literature, as they span the most\ncommon treatments of thermodynamics, including simulations evolving: 1) the\ninternal energy only; 2) the internal energy plus an explicit cooling function;\n3) the total energy without cooling; and 4) total energy including cooling.

Using mean-field analysis, i.e., when\nthe number of users go to infinity, we analytically show that the energy\nrequired to guarantee the required user rate can be made as small as required\nat the cost of a higher delay (\"delay-energy tradeoff\"). We explicitly compute\nthe delay under the proposed scheduling policy and discuss how delay\ndifferentiation can be achieved. We extend the results to multi-band\nmulti-access channel. Finally, all the results can be generalized in a\nstraightforward fashion to broadcast channel due to the AWGN\nmultiaccess-broadcast duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2008 06:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-24"}

To get more bandwidth, multipath routing is one\nappropriate solution provided that inter-path interferences are minimized. In\nthis paper, we address the problem of interfering paths in the context of\nwireless multimedia sensor networks and consider both intra-session as well as\ninter-session interferences. Our main objective is to provide necessary\nbandwidth to multimedia applications through non-interfering paths while\nincreasing the network lifetime. To do so, we adopt an incremental approach\nwhere for a given session, only one path is built at once. Additional paths are\nbuilt when required, typically in case of congestion or bandwidth shortage.\nInterference awareness and energy saving are achieved by switching a subset of\nsensor nodes in a {\\em passive state} in which they do not take part in the\nrouting process. Despite the routing overhead introduced by the incremental\napproach we adopt, our simulations show that this can be compensated by the\noverall achieved throughput and the amount of consumed energy per correctly\nreceived packet especially for relatively long sessions such as multimedia\nones. This is mainly due to the fact that a small number of non-interfering\npaths allows for better performances than a large number of interfering ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2008 09:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-08"}

It is known from electron scattering that such picture is valid\nonly when transferred momentum |q|>400 MeV/c. For lower |q|'s, the nucleus is\nprobed with a lower spatial resolution and a few nucleons are involved in the\nscattering, so the use of the impulse approximation is unjustified.

Over the last decade, the observational fundament to probe the\nstellar spindown has dramatically improved. Significant progress has been made\nin exploring the underlying physical causes of the rotational braking.\nParameterized models combining the effects of star-disk interaction, winds, and\npre-main sequence contraction are able to reproduce the main features of the\nrotational data for stars spanning more than 3 orders of magnitude in age.

Strong emission lines from highly ionized ions of C,\nO, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe are detected. The spectra are fitted by a\nmulti-temperature thin-thermal plasma model with an interstellar absorption N_H\n= 2--3*10**21 cm**-2.

The reddening strongly suggests that the\nemission lines originated from the wind-wind shock zone, where the average\nvelocity is ~600 km/s. The red-shift motion is inconsistent with a scenario in\nwhich the X-rays originate from the wind-wind collision zone in the\nshort-period binary, and would be evidence supporting the widely separated O\nsupergiant as a companion. This may make up the collision zone be lying behind\nthe short-period binary.

My thesis has considered problems of both aspects.\nFirst I studied the stochastic behavior of TCP, the primary algorithm governing\ntraffic in the current Internet, in an elementary network scenario consisting\nof a standalone infinite-sized buffer and an access link. The effect of the\nfast recovery and fast retransmission (FR/FR) algorithms is also considered. I\nshowed that my model can be extended further to involve the effect of link\npropagation delay, characteristic of WAN. I continued my thesis with the\ninvestigation of finite-sized semi-bottleneck buffers, where packets can be\ndropped not only at the link, but also at the buffer. I demonstrated that the\nbehavior of the system depends only on a certain combination of the parameters.\nMoreover, an analytic formula was derived that gives the ratio of packet loss\nrate at the buffer to the total packet loss rate. This formula makes it\npossible to treat buffer-losses as if they were link-losses. Finally, I studied\ncomputer networks from a structural perspective. I demonstrated through fluid\nsimulations that the distribution of resources, specifically the link\nbandwidth, has a serious impact on the global performance of the network. Then\nI analyzed the distribution of edge betweenness in a growing scale-free tree\nunder the condition that a local property, the in-degree of the \"younger\" node\nof an arbitrary edge, is known in order to find an optimum distribution of link\ncapacity. The derived formula is exact even for finite-sized networks. I also\ncalculated the conditional expectation of edge betweenness, rescaled for\ninfinite networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2008 15:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-08"}
