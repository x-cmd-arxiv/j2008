In this work we give a\ncomprehensive study for the full one-loop supersymmetric effects on the Zbb\ncoupling in both the MSSM and the NMSSM by considering all current constraints\nwhich are from the precision electroweak measurements, the direct search for\nsparticles and Higgs bosons, the stability of Higgs potential, the dark matter\nrelic density, and the muon g-2 measurement. We analyze the characters of each\ntype of the corrections and search for the SUSY parameter regions where the\ncorrections could be sizable. We find that the sizable corrections may come\nfrom the Higgs sector with light m_A and large tan-beta, which can reach -2%\nand -6% for rho_b and sin^2 \\theta_{eff}^b,respectively. However, such sizable\nnegative corrections are just opposite to what needed to solve the anomaly. We\nalso scan over the allowed parameter space and investigate to what extent\nsupersymmetry can narrow the discrepancy. We find that under all current\nconstraints, the supersymmetric effects are quite restrained and cannot\nsignificantly ameliorate the anomaly of Zbb coupling. Compared with \\chi^2/dof\n= 9.62/2 in the SM, the MSSM and NMSSM can only improve it to \\chi^2/dof =\n8.77/2 in the allowed parameter space. Therefore, if the anomaly of Zbb\ncoupling is not a statistical or systematic problem, it would suggest new\nphysics beyond the MSSM or NMSSM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 06:20:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2008 14:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-21"}

Imminent catastrophic shifts\n(like desertification) manifest themselves in a drastic change of the stability\nproperties of spatial colonies, as the chance of a cluster to disappear depends\nlogarithmically, rather than linearly, on its size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Oct 2008 18:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-07"}

In the limit case when the NDWP structure is induced by the\nlocal nonlinearity coefficient represented by a set of two delta-functions, a\nfully analytical solution is obtained for symmetric, antisymmetric and\nasymmetric states. In this solvable model, the SSB bifurcation has a fully\nsubcritical character. Numerical analysis, based on both direct simulations and\ncomputation of stability eigenvalues, demonstrates that, while the symmetric\nstates are stable up to the SSB bifurcation point, both symmetric and emerging\nasymmetric states, as well as all antisymmetric ones, are unstable in the model\nwith the delta-functions. In the general model with a finite width of the\nnonlinear-potential wells, the asymmetric states quickly become stable,\nsimultaneously with the switch of the SSB bifurcation from the subcritical to\nsupercritical type. Antisymmetric solutions may also get stabilized in the NDWP\nstructure of the general type, which gives rise to a bistability between them\nand asymmetric states. The symmetric states require a finite norm for their\nexistence, an explanation to which is given. A full diagram for the existence\nand stability of the trapped states in the model is produced.

Aims: The evolutionary status and GC origin of the\nHVS SDSS J113312.12+010824.9 (HVS7) is constrained from a detailed study of its\nstellar parameters and chemical composition. Methods: High-resolution spectra\nof HVS7 obtained with UVES on the ESO VLT were analysed using state-of-the-art\nNLTE/LTE modelling techniques that can account for a chemically-peculiar\ncomposition via opacity sampling. Results: Instead of the expected slight\nenrichments of alpha-elements and near-solar Fe, huge chemical peculiarities of\nall elements are apparent. The He abundance is very low (<1/100 solar), C, N\nand O are below the detection limit, i.e they are underabundant (<1/100, <1/3\nand <1/10 solar). Heavier elements, however, are overabundant: the iron group\nby a factor of ~10, P, Co and Cl by factors ~40, 80 and 440 and rare-earth\nelements and Hg even by ~10000. An additional finding, relevant also for other\nchemically peculiar stars are the large NLTE effects on abundances of TiII and\nFeII (~0.6-0.7dex). The derived abundance pattern of HVS7 is characteristic for\nthe class of chemical peculiar magnetic B stars on the main sequence. The\nchemical composition and high vsini=55+-2km/s render a low mass nature of HVS7\nas a blue horizontal branch star unlikely. Conclusions: Such a surface\nabundance pattern is caused by atomic diffusion in a possibly magnetically\nstabilised, non-convective atmosphere. Hence all chemical information on the\nstar's place of birth and its evolution has been washed out. High precision\nastrometry is the only means to validate a GC origin for HVS7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Oct 2008 23:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-07"}

In this paper we characterize\nthe information-theoretic performance of MIMO linear receivers in two different\nasymptotic regimes. For fixed number of antennas, we investigate the limit of\nerror probability in the high-SNR regime in terms of the Diversity-Multiplexing\nTradeoff (DMT). Following this, we characterize the error probability for fixed\nSNR in the regime of large (but finite) number of antennas.\n  As far as the DMT is concerned, we report a negative result: we show that\nboth linear Zero-Forcing (ZF) and linear Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE)\nreceivers achieve the same DMT, which is largely suboptimal even in the case\nwhere outer coding and decoding is performed across the antennas. We also\nprovide an approximate quantitative analysis of the markedly different behavior\nof the MMSE and ZF receivers at finite rate and non-asymptotic SNR, and show\nthat while the ZF receiver achieves poor diversity at any finite rate, the MMSE\nreceiver error curve slope flattens out progressively, as the coding rate\nincreases.\n  When SNR is fixed and the number of antennas becomes large, we show that the\nmutual information at the output of a MMSE or ZF linear receiver has\nfluctuations that converge in distribution to a Gaussian random variable, whose\nmean and variance can be characterized in closed form. This analysis extends to\nthe linear receiver case a well-known result previously obtained for the\noptimal receiver.

Namely, in our previous works\nwe demonstrated that all well-known important thermodynamical characteristics\nof the black hole (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, Bekenstein entropy/surface\nquantization and Hawking temperature) can be effectively reproduced starting by\nsimple supposition that black hole horizon circumference holds integer number\nof reduced Compton wave lengths corresponding to mass (energy) spectrum of a\nsmall quantum system. (Obviously it is conceptually analogous to Bohr\nquantization postulate interpreted by de Broglie relation in Old,\nBohr-Sommerfeld, quantum theory.) Especially, black hole entropy can be\npresented as the quotient of the black hole mass and the minimal mass of small\nquantum system in ground mass (energy) state. Now, we suppose that black hole\nmass correction is simply equivalent to negative classical potential energy of\nthe gravitational interaction between black hole and small quantum system in\nground mass (energy) state. As it is not hard to see absolute value of the\nclassical potential energy of gravitational interaction is identical to black\nhole temperature. All this, according to first thermodynamical law, implies\nthat first order entropy correction holds form of the logarithm of the surface\nwith coefficient -0.5.

The comparison of the two spectral\nstates shows that the flux transition is to be ascribed entirely to intervening\nline-of-sight clouds with high column density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 09:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The CoRoT space mission routinely provides high-precision\nphotometric measurements of thousands of stars that have been continuously\nobserved for months.\n  Aims. The discovery and characterization of the first very massive transiting\nplanetary companion with a short orbital period is reported.\n  Methods. A series of 34 transits was detected in the CoRoT light curve of an\nF3V star, observed from May to October 2007 for 152 days. The radius was\naccurately determined and the mass derived for this new transiting, thanks to\nthe combined analysis of the light curve and complementary ground-based\nobservations: high-precision radial-velocity measurements, on-off photometry,\nand high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations.\n  Results. CoRoT-Exo-3b has a radius of 1.01+-0.07 RJup and transits around its\nF3-type primary every 4.26 days in a synchronous orbit. Its mass of 21.66+-1.0\nMJup, density of 26.4+-5.6 g cm^-3, and surface gravity of log g = 4.72 clearly\ndistinguish it from the regular close-in planet population, making it the most\nintriguing transiting substellar object discovered so far.\n  Conclusions. With the current data, the nature of CoRoT-Exo-3b is ambiguous,\nas it could either be a low-mass brown-dwarf or a member of a new class of\n\"superplanets\". Its discovery may help constrain the evolution of close-in\nplanets and brown-dwarfs better. Finally, CoRoT-Exo-3b confirms the trend that\nmassive transiting giant planets (M >= 4 MJup) are found preferentially around\nmore massive stars than the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 10:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Based on our careful analysis and\nestimation of the possible systematic errors, the known X-shaped sources divide\ninto the following three categories: (i) the wings have flatter spectral\nindices than the active lobes, (ii) the wings and the active lobes have\ncomparable spectral indices, and (iii) the wings have steeper spectral indices\nthan the active lobes.

The spatial\nvelocities of both Clouds are unexpectedly higher than their previous values\nresulting from agreement between the available theoretical models of the\nMagellanic System and the observations of neutral hydrogen (HI) associated with\nthe LMC and the SMC. Such proper motion estimates are likely to be at odds with\nthe scenarios for creation of the large-scale structures in the Magellanic\nSystem suggested so far. We investigated this hypothesis for the pure tidal\nmodels, as they were the first ones devised to explain the evolution of the\nMagellanic System, and the tidal stripping is intrinsically involved in every\nmodel assuming the gravitational interaction. The parameter space for the Milky\nWay (MW)-LMC-SMC interaction was analyzed by a robust search algorithm (genetic\nalgorithm) combined with a fast restricted N-body model of the interaction. Our\nmethod extended the known variety of evolutionary scenarios satisfying the\nobserved kinematics and morphology of the Magellanic large-scale structures.\nNevertheless, assuming the tidal interaction, no satisfactory reproduction of\nthe HI data available for the Magellanic Clouds was achieved with the new\nproper motions. We conclude that for the proper motion data by Kallivayalil et\nal., within their 1-sigma errors, the dynamical evolution of the Magellanic\nSystem with the currently accepted total mass of the MW cannot be explained in\nthe framework of pure tidal models. The optimal value for the western component\nof the LMC proper motion was found to be pm_w(LMC) > -1.3 mas/yr in case of\ntidal models. It corresponds to the reduction of the Kallivayalil et al. value\nfor pm_w(LMC) by approx. 40% in its magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 14:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The induced\nauto-oscillations are observed even at zero applied field, which is believed to\nbe the acoustic mode of the synthetic antiferromagnet. While the phase\ncoherence of the auto-oscillation is of the order of microseconds, the power\nautocorrelation time is of the order of milliseconds and can be strongly\ninfluenced by the free layer dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 14:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The hadronic vs. leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission from the\nSupernova Remnant RX J1713.7-3946 is discussed both in the light of new\nobservations and from a theoretical point of view.\n  Methods. The existing good spatial correlation of the gamma-ray emission and\nthe nonthermal X-ray emission is analyzed theoretically. In addition, the\nrecently published new H.E.S.S. observations define the energy spectrum more\nprecisely, in particular at the high and low energy ends of the instrument's\ndynamical range. There now exist much more constraining X-ray observations from\nSuzaku that extend substantially beyond 10 keV. These new data are compared\nwith the authors' previous theoretical predictions, both for dominant hadronic\nand for simple inverse Compton models.\n  Results. Apart from the well-known MHD correlation between magnetic field\nstrength and plasma density variations, emphasized by the wind-bubble-structure\nof the remnant, it is argued that the regions of magnetic field amplification\nalso are correlated with enhanced densities of accelerated nuclear particles\nand the associated streaming instabilities. Therefore a correlation of\nnonthermal X-ray and \\gr emission is not only possible but even to be expected\nfor a hadronic emission scenario. A leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission\nwould require an implausibly uniform strength of the magnetic field. The\nobservational and theoretical inferences about substantial field amplification\nin this remnant agree very well with the recent X-ray and \\gr observations.\n  Conclusions. All this argues strongly for the dominance of hadronic \\grs in\nthe \\gr emission spectrum and a fortiori for an overwhelming contribution of\nnuclear cosmic ray particles to the nonthermal energy in this remnant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 15:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2008 11:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
