If the boundary period between BL Her and W Vir stars is adopted at 4\ndays, both groups differ significantly in (V-I) colors. We identify a group of\n16 peculiar W Vir stars with different appearance of the light curves, brighter\nand bluer than ordinary stars of that type. Four of these peculiar W Vir stars\nshow additional eclipsing modulation superimposed on the pulsation light\ncurves. Four other stars of that type show long-period secondary variations\nwhich may be ellipsoidal modulations. It suggests that peculiar W Vir subgroup\nmay be related to binarity. In total, we identified seven type II Cepheids\nsimultaneously exhibiting eclipsing variations which is a very large fraction\ncompared to classical Cepheids in the LMC. We discuss diagrams showing Fourier\nparameters of the light curve decomposition against periods. Three sharp\nfeatures interpreted as an effect of resonances between radial modes are\ndetectable in these diagrams for type II Cepheids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2008 21:43:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2009 13:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-07"}

The quantization map is\nmoreover required to be a linear bijection. It is known that there is in\ngeneral no natural quantization procedure. However, considering manifolds\nendowed with additional structures, such as projective or pseudo-conformal\nstructures, one can seek for quantizations that depend on this additional\nstructure and that are natural if the dependence with respect to the structure\nis taken into account.\n  The question of existence of such a quantization was addressed in a series of\npapers in the context of projective geometry, using the framework of\nThomas-Whitehead connections (see Bordemann, Hansoul and Fox). Recently, we\nrecovered these existence results, using the theory of Cartan projective\nconnections.\n  In the present work, we show that our method can be adapted to\npseudo-conformal geometry to yield the so-called natural and conformally\ninvariant quantization for arbitrary symbols, still outside some critical\nsituations.

Detailed analysis of the new and\nprevious data reveals subtle visible/near-infrared color variations across the\nsurface of Haumea. The color variations are spatially correlated with a\npreviously identified surface region, redder in B-R and darker than the mean\nsurface. Our photometry indicates that the J-H colors of Haumea\n(J-H=-0.057+/-0.016 mag) and its brightest satellite Hi'iaka\n(J-H=-0.399+/-0.034 mag) are significantly (>9 sigma) different. The satellite\nHi'iaka is unusually blue in J-H, consistent with strong 1.5 micron water-ice\nabsorption. The phase coefficient of Haumea in the J-band is found to increase\nmonotonically with wavelength in the range 0.4<lambda<1.3. We compare our\nfindings with other Solar system objects and discuss implications regarding the\nsurface of Haumea.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2008 07:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We perform a suite of vertically stratified local interstellar\nmedium (ISM) simulations in which supernova rates and vertical gas column\ndensities are systematically varied based on the Schmidt-Kennicutt law. Our\nsimulations have a sufficiently high spatial resolution (1.95 pc) to follow the\nhydrodynamic interactions among multiple supernovae that structure the ISM. At\na given supernova rate, we find that the mean mass-weighted sound speed and\nvelocity dispersion decrease as the inverse square root of gas density,\nindicating that both thermal and turbulent pressures are nearly constant in the\nmidplane, so the effective equation of state is isobaric. In contrast, across\nour four models having supernova rates that range from one to 512 times the\nGalactic supernova rate, the mass-weighted velocity dispersion remains in the\nrange 4-6 km/s. Hence, gas averaged over ~100 pc regions follows an effective\nequation of state that is close to isothermal. Simulated H I emission lines\nhave widths of 10-18 km/s, comparable to observed values. In our highest\nsupernova rate model, superbubble blow-outs occur, and the turbulent pressure\non large scales is >~4 times higher than the thermal pressure.
