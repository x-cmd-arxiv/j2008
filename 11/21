These constraints can also be\nderived with weaker assumptions, by demanding the existence of four-point\namplitudes that factorize properly in all unitarity limits with complex\nmomenta. From this starting point, we show that the BCFW prescription can be\ninterpreted as an algorithm for fully constructing a tree-level S-matrix, and\nthat complex factorization of general BCFW amplitudes follows from the\nfactorization of four-particle amplitudes. The allowed set of BCFW deformations\nis identified, formulated entirely as a statement on the three-particle sector,\nand using only complex factorization as a guide. Consequently, our analysis\nbased on the physical consistency of the S-matrix is entirely independent of\nfield theory. We analyze the case of pure Yang-Mills, and outline a proof for\ngravity. For Yang-Mills, we also show that the well-known scaling behavior of\nBCFW-deformed amplitudes at large z is a simple consequence of factorization.\nFor gravity, factorization in certain channels requires asymptotic behavior\n~1/z^2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 20:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

In agreement with the recent findings of Wapinski and collaborators\n(Nature 449, 2007), WGD paralogs often perform ``core'' cell functions, such as\ntranslation and DNA replication, while local duplications associate with\n``peripheral'' functions such as response to stress. Our results also support\nthe fact that domain architectures are a reliable tool to detect homology, as\nthe domains of duplicates are largely invariant with date and nature of the\nduplication, while their sequences and also their functions might migrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 18:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-21"}

This is technologically important; for example, the\nnanoscale structure of glassy polymers has a direct correlation with their\nmacroscopic physical properties. We have discovered how a local, high frequency\ndynamic process can be used to monitor and even predict macroscopic behavior in\nglassy polymers. Polyvinylethylenes vitrified by different chemical and\nthermodynamic pathways exhibit different densities in the glassy state. We find\nthat the rate and amplitude of a high frequency relaxation mode (the\nJohari-Goldstein process involving local motion of segments of the chain\nbackbone) can either correlate or anti-correlate with the density. This implies\nthat neither the unoccupied (free) volume nor the configurational entropy\ngoverns the local dynamics in any general sense. Rather it is the magnitude of\nthe fluctuations in local density that underlie these nm-scale motions. We show\nhow properties of the dynamics and the density fluctuations can both be\ninterpreted in terms of an asymmetric double well potential. Finally, since\nfluctuations underlie the macroscopic properties, we argue that information\nabout the latter should be obtainable from characterization of the local\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 19:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Formalizing the\nintuitive connection between the ground (minimal) energy of the Hamiltonian and\nthe minimum number of violated constraints is problematic, since the number of\nconstraints being violated is not well defined when the terms in the\nHamiltonian do not commute. The detectability lemma proved in this paper\nprovides precisely such a quantitative connection. We apply the lemma to derive\na quantum analogue of a basic primitive in classical complexity: amplification\nof probabilities by random walks on expander graphs. It holds under the\nrestriction that the interaction graph of the local Hamiltonian is an expander.\nOur proofs are based on a novel structure imposed on the Hilbert space that we\ncall the $XY$ decomposition, which enables a reduction from the quantum\nnon-commuting case to the commuting case (where many classical arguments go\nthrough).\n  The results may have several interesting implications. First, proving a\nquantum analogue to the PCP theorem is one of the most important challenges in\nquantum complexity theory. Our quantum gap amplification lemma may be viewed as\nthe quantum analogue of the first of the three main steps in Dinur's PCP proof.\nQuantum gap amplification may also be related to spectral gap amplification,\nand in particular, to fault tolerance of adiabatic computation.

A feature of this time-dependent,\ntwo-dimensional convection-diffusion-reaction equation is the presence of a\nmixed spatial-derivative term, which stems from the correlation between the two\nunderlying stochastic processes for the asset price and its variance.\n  Semi-discretization of the Heston PDE, using finite difference schemes on a\nnon-uniform grid, gives rise to large systems of stiff ordinary differential\nequations. For the effective numerical solution of these systems, standard\nimplicit time-stepping methods are often not suitable anymore, and tailored\ntime-discretization methods are required.

These\nyoung local associations offer insights into the star formation process in\nlow-density environments, shed light on the substellar domain, and could have\nplayed an important role in the recent history of the local interstellar\nmedium. Ages estimates for these associations have been derived in the\nliterature by several ways. In this work we have studied the kinematic\nevolution of young local associations and their relation to other young stellar\ngroups and structures in the local interstellar medium, thus casting new light\non recent star formation processes in the solar neighbourhood. We compiled the\ndata published in the literature for young local associations, including the\nastrometric data from the new Hipparcos reduction. Using a realistic Galactic\npotential we integrated the orbits for these associations and the Sco-Cen\ncomplex back in time. Combining these data with the spatial structure of the\nLocal Bubble and the spiral structure of the Galaxy, we propose a recent\nhistory of star formation in the solar neighbourhood. We suggest that both the\nSco-Cen complex and young local associations originated as a result of the\nimpact of the inner spiral arm shock wave against a giant molecular cloud. The\ncore of the giant molecular cloud formed the Sco-Cen complex, and some small\ncloudlets in a halo around the giant molecular cloud formed young local\nassociations several million years later. We also propose a supernova in young\nlocal associations a few million years ago as the most likely candidate to have\nreheated the Local Bubble to its present temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 21:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In particular, the differential rotation is\nnow well constrained by helioseismic observations. Helioseismology also gives\nus information about the depth-dependence of the meridional circulation in the\nnear-surface layers. The typical velocity inputs used in solar dynamo models,\nhowever, continue to be an analytic fit to the observed differential rotation\nand a theoretically constructed meridional flow profile that matches only the\npeak flow speed at the surface. Here we take the first steps towards realistic\nhelioseismic data assimilation, by presenting methodologies for constructing\ndifferential rotation and meridional circulation profiles that more closely\nconform to the observational constraints currently available. We also present\nsimulations driven by the assimilated rotation and four plausible profiles for\nthe internal meridional circulation -- all of which match the helioseismically\ninferred near-surface depth-dependence, but whose magnitudes are made to vary.\nWe discuss how the results compare with those that are driven by purely\nanalytic fits. Our results indicate that the latitudinal shear of the rotation\nin the bulk of the solar convection zone plays a more important role, than\neither the tachocline or surface radial shear, in the induction of toroidal\nfield. We also find that it is the speed of the equatorward counter-flow in the\nmeridional flow at the base of the convection zone, and not how far into the\nradiative interior it penetrates, that primarily determines the dynamo cycle\nperiod. Given that improved helioseismic constraints are expected to be\navailable in the future, our analysis lays the basis for assimilating these\ndata within dynamo models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 23:46:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2009 05:32:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 20:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-30"}

We identify a strong correlation between the mean time taken to\nacquire a spectroscopic redshift and the measured redshift. This correlation\nreveals that shorter response times favour smaller redshift bursts. This is\ncompelling evidence for a selection effect that biases longer response times\nwith relatively brighter high redshift bursts.

It is not\nsurprising that there exist a plethora of sorting algorithms. For all the\nsorting algorithms, it is an accepted performance limit that sorting algorithms\nare linearithmic or O(N lg N).

The sorting algorithm uses comparison by the ordering property to\narrange the data elements from an initial permutation into a sorted\npermutation.\n  Linear O(N) sorting algorithms exist, but use a priori knowledge of the data\nto use a specific property of the data and thus have greater performance. In\ncontrast, the linearithmic sorting algorithms are generalized by using a\nuniversal property of data-comparison, but have a linearithmic performance\nlower bound.

An analogy is that a deck of\ncards is ordered within the pack, but before a game of poker or solitaire the\ndeck is shuffled to create a random permutation. Shuffling is used to assure\nthat an aggregate of data elements for a sequence S is randomly arranged, but\navoids an ordered or partially ordered permutation.\n  Shuffling is the process of arranging data elements into a random\npermutation. The sequence S as an aggregation of N data elements, there are N!\npossible permutations. For the large number of possible permutations, two of\nthe possible permutations are for a sorted or ordered placement of data\nelements--both an ascending and descending sorted permutation. Shuffling must\navoid inadvertently creating either an ascending or descending permutation.\n  Shuffling is frequently coupled to another algorithmic function --\npseudo-random number generation. The efficiency and quality of the shuffle is\ndirectly dependent upon the random number generation algorithm utilized. A more\neffective and efficient method of shuffling is to use parameterization to\nconfigure the shuffle, and to shuffle into sub-arrays by utilizing the encoding\nof the data elements.

A cosmologically derived infall law with an inside-out\nprocess for the disk formation and a variable star formation efficiency can\nindeed well reproduce all the properties of the disk. However, the cosmological\nmodel presented here does not have sufficient resolution to capture the\nrequested inside-out formation for the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2008 10:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We examined whether there is\nless selection against exonization of transposed elements in duplicated genes\nthan in single-copy genes. Results: Genome-wide analysis of exonization of\ntransposed elements revealed a higher rate of exonization within duplicated\ngenes relative to single-copy genes. The gene for TIF-IA, an RNA polymerase I\ntranscription initiation factor, underwent a humanoid-specific triplication,\nall three copies of the gene are active transcriptionally, although only one\ncopy retains the ability to generate the TIF-IA protein. Prior to TIF-IA\ntriplication, an Alu element was inserted into the first intron. In one of the\nnon-protein coding copies, this Alu is exonized. We identified a single point\nmutation leading to exonization in one of the gene duplicates. When this\nmutation was introduced into the TIF-IA coding copy, exonization was activated\nand the level of the protein-coding mRNA was reduced substantially.

Our study aims to measure the slopes of the X-ray\nsurface brightness and of the gas density profiles in the outskirts of massive\nclusters. These constraints are compared to similar results obtained from\nobservations and numerical simulations of the temperature and dark matter\ndensity profiles with the intention of presenting a consistent picture of the\nouter regions of galaxy clusters. We extract the surface brightness profiles\nSb(r) of 52 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters at z>0.3 from X-ray exposures\nobtained with Chandra.
