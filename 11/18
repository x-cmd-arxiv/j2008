We analyse this problem in the simple setting of\nM-theory on K3xK3. Given a certain flux which is consistent with the F-theory\nlimit, we can explicitly derive the positions at which D7 branes or stacks of\nD7 branes are stabilised. The analysis is based on a parameterization of the\nmoduli space of type IIB string theory on T^2/Z_2 (including D7-brane\npositions) in terms of the periods of integral cycles of M-theory on K3. This\nallows us, in particular, to select a specific desired gauge group by the\nchoice of flux numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2008 18:35:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 15:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-17"}

Context. The metal content of dwarf galaxies and the metal\nenrichment of the intergalactic medium both suggest that mass loss from\ngalaxies is a significant factor for the chemical evolution history of\ngalaxies, in particular of dwarf galaxies. However, no clear evidence of a\nblow-away in local dwarf galaxies has been found so far.\n  Aims. We therefore performed a detailed kinematic analysis of the neutral and\nionised gas in the nearby star-forming irregular dwarf galaxy NGC 2366 in order\nto make predictions about the fate of the gas and to get a more complete\npicture of this galaxy.\n  Methods. A deep Halpha image and Fabry-Perot interferometric data of NGC 2366\nwere obtained. They were complemented by HI synthesis data from the THINGS\nsurvey. We searched for line-splitting both in Halpha and HI by performing a\nGaussian decomposition. To get an idea whether the expansion velocities are\nhigh enough for a gas blow-away, we used the pseudo-isothermal halo model,\nwhich gives us realistic values for the escape velocities of NGC 2366.

Galactic winds of this strength are incompatible with current\nisotropic models for Cosmic Ray transport. In order to reproduce our local CRs\nin the presence of Galactic winds, charged CRs are required to be much more\nlocalized than in the standard isotropic GALPROP models. This requires that\nanisotropic diffusion is the dominant diffusion mode in the interstellar\nmedium, particularly that the diffusion in the disk and in the halo are\ndifferent. In addition small scale phenomena such as trapping by molecular\ncloud complexes and the structure of our local environment might influence the\nsecondary CR production rate and our local CR density gradients. We introduce\nan anisotropic convection driven transport model (aCDM) which is consistent\nwith the Galactic wind observations by ROSAT. This also explains the large\nbulge/disk ratio as observed by INTEGRAL. Furthermore such models predict an\nincrease in the $e^+/(e^++e^-)$-fraction as observed by PAMELA and HEAT, if the\nsynchrotron constraints in the 408 MHz and WMAP range are taken into account.\nNo additional contribution from Dark Matter is required. The aCDM is able to\nexplain the absence of a positron annihilation signal from molecular clouds as\nobserved by INTEGRAL by virtue of a mechanism which confines and isotropizes\nCRs between MCs. We find that the EGRET excess of diffuse $\\gamma$-rays\ncurrently cannot be explained by astrophysical effects in this type of model\nand that the interpretation of the EGRET excess as Dark Matter annihilation is\nperfectly consistent with all observational constraints from local CR fluxes\nand synchrotron radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2008 18:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

This implies that Lyman\nalpha galaxies are not primordial, as has been thought in the past. However,\nthis dust has not been directly detected in emission; rather it has been\ninferred based on extinction estimates from rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and\noptical observations. This can be tricky, as both dust and old stars redden\ngalactic spectra at the wavelengths used to infer dust. Measuring dust emission\ndirectly from these galaxies is thus a more accurate way to estimate the total\ndust mass, giving us real physical information on the stellar populations and\ninterstellar medium (ISM) enrichment. New generation instruments such as the\nAtacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA), should be\nable to detect dust emission from some of these galaxies in the sub-mm.

Our focus is on the effect of nuclear dissociation below\nthe shock on the linear growth, and non-linear saturation, of non-radial\noscillations of the shocked fluid. We combine two-dimensional, time-dependent\nhydrodynamic simulations using FLASH2.5 with a solution to the linear\neigenvalue problem, and demonstrate the consistency of the two approaches.\nPrevious studies of this `Standing Accretion Shock Instability' (SASI) have\nfocused either on zero-energy accretion flows without nuclear dissociation, or\nmade use of a detailed finite-temperature nuclear equation of state and\nincluded strong neutrino heating. Our main goal in this and subsequent papers\nis to introduce equations of state of increasing complexity, in order to\nisolate the various competing effects. In this work we employ an ideal gas\nequation of state with a constant rate of nuclear dissociation below the shock,\nand do not include neutrino heating. We find that a negative Bernoulli\nparameter below the shock significantly lowers the real frequency, growth rate,\nand saturation amplitude of the SASI. A decrease in the adiabatic index has\nsimilar effects. The non-linear development of the instability is characterized\nby an expansion of the shock driven by turbulent kinetic energy at nearly\nconstant internal energy. Our results also provide further insight into the\ninstability mechanism: the rate of growth of a particular mode is fastest when\nthe radial advection time from the shock to the accretor overlaps with the\nperiod of a standing lateral sound wave. The fastest-growing mode can therefore\nbe modified by nuclear dissociation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2008 22:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2009 05:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}

(arxiv:0804.4142) that\nthere is `an unexpected brightness of the SnIa data at z>1'. We quantify this\nstatement by constructing a new statistic which is applicable directly on the\nType Ia Supernova (SnIa) distance moduli. This statistic is designed to pick up\nsystematic brightness trends of SnIa datapoints with respect to a best fit\ncosmological model at high redshifts. It is based on binning the normalized\ndifferences between the SnIa distance moduli and the corresponding best fit\nvalues in the context of a specific cosmological model (eg LCDM). We then focus\non the highest redshift bin and extend its size towards lower redshifts until\nthe Binned Normalized Difference (BND) changes sign (crosses 0) at a redshift\nz_c (bin size N_c). The bin size N_c of this crossing (the statistical\nvariable) is then compared with the corresponding crossing bin size N_{mc} for\nMonte Carlo data realizations based on the best fit model. We find that the\ncrossing bin size N_c obtained from the Union08 and Gold06 data with respect to\nthe best fit LCDM model is anomalously large compared to N_{mc} of the\ncorresponding Monte Carlo datasets obtained from the best fit LCDM in each\ncase. In particular, only 2.2% of the Monte Carlo LCDM datasets are consistent\nwith the Gold06 value of N_c while the corresponding probability for the\nUnion08 value of N_c is 5.3%. Thus, according to this statistic, the\nprobability that the high redshift brightness bias of the Union08 and Gold06\ndatasets is realized in the context of a (w_0,w_1)=(-1,0) model (LCDM\ncosmology) is less than 6%.

We present a detailed calculation of the spectral line\ndistortions on the CMB spectrum arising from the Lyman-alpha and the lowest\ntwo-photon transitions in the recombination of hydrogen (H), and the\ncorresponding lines from helium (He). The peak of these distortions mainly\ncomes from the Lyman-alpha transition and occurs at about 170 microns, which is\nthe Wien part of the CMB. The major theoretical limitation for extracting\ncosmological parameters from the CMB sky lies in the precision with which we\ncan calculate the cosmological recombination process. With this motivation, we\nperform a multi-level calculation of the recombination of H and He with the\naddition of the spin-forbidden transition for neutral helium (He I), plus the\nhigher order two-photon transitions for H and among singlet states of He I. We\nfind that the inclusion of the spin-forbidden transition results in more than a\npercent change in the ionization fraction, while the other transitions give\nmuch smaller effects.

The adversarial jammer can view\nthe transmitted symbols x_i one at a time, and can change up to a p-fraction of\nthem. However, the decisions of the jammer must be made in an online or causal\nmanner.

Binarity is also\na key ingredient in stellar population studies, and is a prerequisite to\ncalibrate the binary evolution channels. In this paper we present an overview\nof several commonly used methods to pair individual stars into binary systems,\nwhich we refer to as pairing functions. These pairing functions are frequently\nused by observers and computational astronomers, either for their mathematical\nconvenience, or because they roughly describe the expected outcome of the star\nforming process. We discuss the consequences of each pairing function for the\ninterpretation of observations and numerical simulations. The binary fraction\nand mass ratio distribution generally depend strongly on the selection of the\nrange in primary spectral type in a sample. The mass ratio distribution and\nbinary fraction derived from a binarity survey among a mass-limited sample of\ntargets is thus not representative for the population as a whole. Neither\ntheory nor observations indicate that random pairing of binary components from\nthe mass distribution, the simplest pairing function, is realistic. It is more\nlikely that companion stars are formed in a disk around a star, or that a\npre-binary core fragments into two binary components. The results of our\nanalysis are important for (i) the interpretation of the observed mass ratio\ndistribution and binary fraction for a sample of stars, (ii) a range of\npossible initial condition algorithms for star cluster simulations, and (iii)\nhow to discriminate between the different star formation scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2008 08:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\noscillations frequencies are closely related to stellar interior properties via\nthe density and sound speed profiles. Since these are tightly linked with the\nmass and evolutionary state, we can expect to determine the age and mass of a\nstar from the comparison of its oscillation spectrum with predictions of\nstellar models. Such a comparison suffers both from the problems we face when\nmodeling a particular star (as the uncertainties on global parameters and\nchemical composition) and from our misunderstanding of processes at work in\nstellar interiors (as the transport processes that may lead to core mixing and\naffect the model ages). For stars where observations have provided precise and\nnumerous oscillation frequencies together with accurate global parameters and\nadditional information (as the radius or the mass if the star is in a binary\nsystem, the interferometric radius or the mean density if the star is an\nexoplanet host), we can also expect to better constrain the physical\ndescription of the stellar structure and to get a more reliable age estimation.\nAfter a survey of stellar pulsations, we present some seismic diagnostics that\ncan be used to infer the age of a star as well as their limitations. We then\nillustrate the ability of asteroseismology to scrutinize stellar interiors on\nthe basis of a few exemples.

In the present paper, we revisit the\nparadigmatic model of non-signalling boxes and introduce the concept of a\ngenuine box. This will allow us to present the first generalized non-signalling\nmodel featuring quantum-like dynamics. In particular, we present the coupler, a\ndevice enabling non-locality swapping, the analogue of quantum entanglement\nswapping, as well as teleportation. Remarkably, part of the boundary between\nquantum and post-quantum correlations emerges in our study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2008 15:43:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2009 14:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-18"}

To make\ncomparisons with the experimental data at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider (RHIC), parton-hadron duality is assumed. We find that whereas the\nintegrated $v_2$ matches the experimental data, the gluon (or pion) $v_2(p_T)$\nis about 20-50% smaller than the experimental data. Hadronization via gluon\nfragmentation and quark recombination seems to be the key to explaining the\nnecessary jump of $v_2(p_T)$ from the partonic to the hadronic phase. We also\nshow that the elliptic flow values moderately depend on the chosen freezeout\ncondition, which will thus constrain the shear viscosity to the entropy density\nratio of the quark gluon plasma created at RHIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2008 15:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 16:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2009 17:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-18"}
