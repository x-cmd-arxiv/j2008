Our numerical experiments are\ndesigned to represent merger events occurring at various cosmic epochs. The\ninitial conditions of the encounters are consistent with the LambdaCDM paradigm\nof structure formation, and the simulations include the effects of radiative\ncooling, star formation, and supernovae feedback. We find that the pairing of\nSMBHs depends sensitively on the amount of baryonic mass preserved in the\ncenter of the companion galaxies during the last phases of the merger. In\nparticular, due to the combination of gasdynamics and star formation, we find\nthat a pair of SMBHs can form in 1:10 minor mergers provided that galaxies are\nrelatively gas-rich (gas fractions of 30% of the disk mass) and that the\nmergers occur at relatively high redshift (z~3), when dynamical friction\ntimescales are shorter. Since 1:10 mergers are most common events during the\nassembly of galaxies, and mergers are more frequent at high redshift when\ngalaxies are also more gas-rich, our results have positive implications for\nfuture gravitational wave experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2008 20:10:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 12:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We examine the corresponding\nsingular structures in the effective potentials of the relativistic\nSchroedinger equation obtained from the Pauli reduction of the TBDE.

We have\nrecently proposed a set of stabilising transformations which is constructed\nfrom a small set of already found UPOs (Crofts and Davidchack 2006). The main\nbenefit of using the proposed set is that its cardinality depends on the\ndimension of the unstable manifold at the UPO rather than the dimension of the\nsystem. In a typical situation the dimension of the unstable manifold is much\nsmaller than the dimension of the system so the number of transformations is\nmuch smaller. Here we extend this approach to high-dimensional systems of ODEs\nand apply it to the model example of a chaotic spatially extended system -- the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. A comparison is made between the performance of\nthis new method against the competing methods of Newton-Armijo (NA) and\nLevernberg-Marquardt (LM).

For a given $\\Phi_c$, the values of $<f_u(\\Phi_c)>$\nincrease as the diameter ($\\sigma_c$) of the crowding particles decreases.

Numerical modeling of specific solar\nregions is hampered by uncertain coronal-field reconstructions and by poorly\nunderstood magnetic re- connection; these limitations result in uncertain\nestimates of field topology, energy, and helicity. The primary advances in\nunderstanding field destabilizations therefore come from the combination of\ngeneric numerical experiments with interpretation of sets of observations.\nThese suggest a critical role for the emergence of twisted flux ropes into\npre-existing strong field for many, if not all, of the active regions that pro-\nduce M- or X-class flares. The flux and internal twist of the emerging ropes\nappear to play as important a role in determining whether an eruption will\ndevelop predom- inantly as flare, confined eruption, or CME, as do the\nproperties of the embedding field. Based on reviewed literature, I outline a\nscenario for major flares and erup- tions that combines flux-rope emergence,\nmass draining, near-surface reconnection, and the interaction with the\nsurrounding field. Whether deterministic forecasting is in principle possible\nremains to be seen: to date no reliable such forecasts can be made.\nLarge-sample studies based on long-duration, comprehensive observations of\nactive regions from their emergence through their flaring phase are needed to\nhelp us better understand these complex phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2008 18:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Thus,\nfrom the perspective of pilot-wave theory itself, many worlds are an illusion.\nIt is further argued that, even leaving pilot-wave theory aside, the theory of\nmany worlds is rooted in the intrinsically unlikely assumption that quantum\nmeasurements should be modelled on classical measurements, and is therefore\nunlikely to be true.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2008 20:34:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2008 21:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}

We show that the bispectra of the 3D stochastic density field\nand of column densities, available from observations, are similar.

Larger\nvalues of sonic Mach number result in increased correlations for modes with\ndifferent wavenumbers. This effect becomes more evident with increasing\nmagnetic field intensity. In addition to the bispectrum, we calculated the 3rd\nand 4th statistical moments of density and column density, namely, skewness and\nkurtosis, respectively. We found a strong dependence of skewness and kurtosis\nwith the sonic Mach number. In particular, as this number increases, so does\nthe asymmetry of the density distribution.

Because nitrogen is\nmore volatile and scarcer than methane, it sublimated from the sunlit\nhemisphere relatively early in the season, so the early summer atmosphere was\nnitrogen rich, and so was the ice deposited on the winter pole. Later in the\nseason, much of the nitrogen was exhausted from the summer pole, but there was\nplenty of methane, which continued to sublimate.

Both techniques have\nsolid theoretical foundations based on analytical calculations as well as on\nnumerical testings. Among the two the VCS, which has been developed quite\nrecently, has two unique features. First of all, it is applicable to turbulent\nvolumes that are not spatially resolved. Second, it can be used with absorption\nlines that do not provide good spatial sampling of different lags over the\nimage of the turbulent object. In fact, recent studies show that measurements\nof absorption line along less than 10 absorption directions are sufficient for\na reliable recovering of the underlying spectrum of the turbulence. Moreover,\nboth weak absorption lines and absorption lines in saturated regime can be\nused, which extends the applicability of the technique.

This production was also calculated, at the tree level, in some\nextensions of the SM such as the vector singlet, the fermion mirror fermion and\nthe vector doublet models by considering the contributions of new neutral gauge\nbosons and exotic fermions. The obtained results for $e^+ e^-$ and $pp$\ncollisions pointed out that the new physics contributions are quite important.\nThis motivates us to calculate the production of a more massive charged gauge\nboson predicted by the ${SU (3)_C \\times SU (3)_L \\times U (1)_X}$ model (3-3-1\nmodel). Thus, the aim of the present paper is to analyze the role played by of\nthe extra gauge boson ${Z^\\prime}$ and of the exotic quarks, predicted in the\nminimal version of the 3-3-1 model, by considering the inclusive production of\na pair of bileptons ($V^\\pm$) in the reaction $p + p \\longrightarrow V^+ + V^-\n+ X$, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies.\n  Our results show that the correct energy behavior of the elementary cross\nsection follows from the balance between the contributions of the extra neutral\ngauge boson with those from the exotic quarks. The extra neutral gauge boson\ninduces flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) at tree level, and we have\nintroduced the ordinary quark mixing matrices for the model when the first\nfamily transforms differently to the other two with respect to $SU(3)_L$. We\nobtain a huge number of heavy bilepton pairs produced for two different values\nof the center of mass energy of the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2008 00:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-30"}

In all cases, we show that at quadratic order in the\noscillation amplitude, the tethered flapping motion induces net forces but no\naverage flow. Our results demonstrate therefore that the scallop theorem is not\nvalid in polymeric fluids. The reciprocal component of the movement of\nbiological appendages such as cilia can thus generate nontrivial forces in\npolymeric fluid such as mucus, and normal-stress differences can be exploited\nas a pure viscoelastic force generation and propulsion method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2008 04:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

Furthermore, the second largest planet is just\nthe second farthest and it orbits very close to the star. Its orbit, the most\ncircular of all, appears to be nearly but not quite commensurable with the\norbit of the third planet, casting doubt that any migration or resonant capture\nof the inner planets has ever occurred and lending support to the idea of\n\"in--situ\" giant planet formation by the process of core accretion. All of the\nabove ideas will be tested in the coming years in this natural laboratory as\nmore observations will become available. This opportunity presents itself in\nconjunction with a physical model that relates the orbits of the observed\nplanets to the structure of the original protoplanetary disk that harbored\ntheir formation at the early stages of protostellar collapse. Using only the 5\nobserved planets of 55 Cnc, this model predicts that the surface density\nprofile of its protoplanetary disk varied with distance $R$ precisely as\n$\\Sigma (R)\\propto R^{-3/2}$, as was also found for the minimum--mass solar\nnebula. Despite this similarity, the disk of 55 Cnc was smaller, heavier, and\nless rotationally supported than the solar nebula, so this system represents a\ndifferent mode of multi--planet formation compared to our own solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2008 04:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-07"}

This problem has been\nparticularly challenging because biological systems typically contain large\nnumbers of interacting elements, which precludes the use of standard brute\nforce approaches. Recently, though, several groups have reported that there may\nbe an alternate strategy. The reports show that reliable statistical models can\nbe built without knowledge of all the interactions in a system; instead,\npairwise interactions can suffice. These findings, however, are based on the\nanalysis of small subsystems. Here we ask whether the observations will\ngeneralize to systems of realistic size, that is, whether pairwise models will\nprovide reliable descriptions of true biological systems. Our results show\nthat, in most cases, they will not. The reason is that there is a crossover in\nthe predictive power of pairwise models: If the size of the subsystem is below\nthe crossover point, then the results have no predictive power for large\nsystems. If the size is above the crossover point, the results do have\npredictive power. This work thus provides a general framework for determining\nthe extent to which pairwise models can be used to predict the behavior of\nwhole biological systems. Applied to neural data, the size of most systems\nstudied so far is below the crossover point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2008 09:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We also show that moderate\ngrain growth produces spectra with weak or no 1um feature, both for flaring\n(Group I) and non-flaring (Group II) sources.

The consequences of the apparent differences\nbetween quantum statistics and classical statistics range from the\nphilosophical interpretations to practical issues as quantum computing. In this\nnote we demonstrate how quantum mechanics can emerge from classical statistical\nsystems. We discuss conditions and circumstances for this to happen. Quantum\nsystems describe isolated subsystems of classical statistical systems with\ninfinitely many states. While infinitely many classical observables \"measure\"\nproperties of the subsystem and its environment, the state of the subsystem can\nbe characterized by the expectation values of only a few probabilistic\nobservables. They define a density matrix, and all the usual laws of quantum\nmechanics follow. No concepts beyond classical statistics are needed for\nquantum physics - the differences are only apparent and result from the\nparticularities of those classical statistical systems which admit a quantum\nmechanical description. In particular, we show how the non-commuting properties\nof quantum operators are associated to the use of conditional probabilities\nwithin the classical system, and how a unitary time evolution reflects the\nisolation of the subsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2008 12:26:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2008 11:13:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 14:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The orbital parameters of the system are\nmeasured and agree well with those found during the last known outburst of the\nsystem in 1995. Correcting the effects of the doppler shifting of the period,\ndue to the orbital motion of the pulsar, leads to the detection of an intrinsic\nspin-up that is well described by a simple model including Pdot and Pdotdot\nterms of -7.5E-10 ss^-1 and 1E-16 ss^-2 respectively. The model is then used to\ncompare the time-resolved variation of the X-ray flux and intrinsic spin-up\nagainst the accretion torque model of Ghosh & Lamb (1979); this finds that GRO\nJ1750-27 is likely located 12-22 kpc distant and that the surface magnetic\nfield of the neutron star is ~2E12 G. The shape of the pulse and the pulsed\nfraction shows different behaviour above and below 20 keV indicating that the\nobserved pulsations are the convolution of many complex components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2008 15:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

It is shown that these\nnonlinear QED processes are observable when a table-top source of intense xuv\nor x-ray laser radiation is operated in conjunction with the LHC.
