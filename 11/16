However, after the success of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe (WMAP) in determining the baryon density, OmegaBh^2, there was a\ndiscrepancy between observationally determined and theoretically determined\nabundances in the case of 7Li. One of the most important uncertain factors in\nthe calculation of the stellar 7Li abundance is the effective temperature,\nTeff. We use sixteen metal-poor halo dwarfs to calculate new Teff values using\nthe excitation energy method. With this temperature scale we then calculate new\nLi abundances for this group of stars in an attempt to resolve the 7Li\ndiscrepancy. Using high signal-to-noise (S/N ~ 100) spectra of 16 metal-poor\nhalo dwarfs, obtained with the UCLES spectrograph on the AAT, measurements of\nequivalent widths from a set of unblended FeI lines are made. These equivalent\nwidths are then used to calculate new Teff values with the use of the single\nline radiative transfer program WIDTH6, where we have constrained the gravity\nusing either theoretical isochrones or the Hipparcos parallax, rather than the\nionization balance. The lithium abundances of the stars are calculated with\nthese temperatures. The physical parameters are derived for the 16 programme\nstars, and two standards. These include Teff, log g, [Fe/H], microturbulence\nand 7Li abundances. A comparison between the temperature scale of this work and\nthose adopted by others has been undertaken.

The analysis in [1] is based on the following\nessential approximations: 1. The SNR was defined in terms of total\nafter-projection signal and noise powers, and the BER was analyzed based on\ntheir ratio. This corresponds to a non-coherent (power-wise) equal-gain\ncombining of both the signal and the noise, and it is not optimum since it does\nnot provide the maximum output SNR. 2. The definition of the total\nafter-projection noise power at each step ignored the fact that the\nafter-projection noise vector had correlated components. 3. The after-combining\nnoises at different steps (and hence the errors) were implicitly assumed to be\nindependent of each other. Under non-coherent equal-gain combining, that is not\nthe case. It turns out that the results in [1] hold also true without these\napproximations, subject to minor modifications only. The purpose of this note\nis to show this and also to extend the average BER results in [1] to the case\nof BPSK-modulated V-BLAST with more than two Rx antennas (eq. 18-20).\nAdditionally, we emphasize that the block error rate is dominated by the first\nstep BER at the high-SNR mode (eq. 14 and 21).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2008 20:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-18"}

This is relevant for various\nprocesses of partial state transfer (quantum communication, indirect\nmeasurement, polarization transfer, {\\it etc}). Given two systems A and B with\ninitial density operators $\\lambda$ and $r$, respectively, we consider most\ngeneral interactions, which lead to transferring certain matrix elements of\nunknown $\\lambda$ into those of the final state ${\\widetilde r}$ of B. We find\nthat this process leads to eliminating the memory on the transferred (or\ncertain other) matrix elements from the final state of A. If one diagonal\nmatrix element is transferred: ${\\widetilde r}_{aa}=\\lambda_{aa}$, the memory\non each non-diagonal element $\\lambda_{a\\not=b}$ is completely eliminated from\nthe final density operator of A. The transfer of a non-diagonal element:\n${\\widetilde r}_{ab}=\\lambda_{ab}$ eliminates the memory on the diagonal\nelements $\\lambda_{aa}$ and $\\lambda_{bb}$, while the memory about their sum\n$\\lambda_{aa}+\\lambda_{bb}$ is kept. Moreover, the memory about $\\lambda_{ab}$\nitself is completely eliminated from the final state of A.

Aims. We show that\nthe instability is a natural way to build nonspherical systems and thus can be\nconsidered as a new technique for constructing equilibrium $N$-body models.\nMethods. The dynamical evolution of the models was followed numerically by\nmeans of the Dehnen's public code gyrfacON. Results. We found that the shape of\nthe density profiles for various initial spherical models didn't change despite\nof the systems were drastically rearranged into triaxial configurations and had\ngot the new scale lengths. The cusp was found to be an invariant feature of\nsuch a rearranging. Starting from a certain unstable spherical $\\gamma$-model\nwe obtain a triaxial system with the same cusp. The end-products are\nanisotropic at large radii and have anisotropy profiles of the Osipkov-Merrit\ntype. The size of the isotropic core once rescaled corresponds to the value of\nmarginally stable $\\gamma$-progenitors and is almost independent of the\nunstable starting point. Conclusions. We conclude that the end-products reach a\nnew steady state and have quite predictable properties. They can be used as\nequilibrium models to describe the elliptical galaxies and bulges. They also\ncan be incorporated in $N$-body simulations deal with multicomponent systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2008 13:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-18"}

By studying the\ncharacteristics of the conservation of momentum for a dynamic jet, the boundary\nconditions for each flow regime are derived, and the flow regimes are\ncharacterized in terms of the process and material parameters.

We present further\ntheoretical analysis of the role of the random and coherent waves in the wave\nprobability density function (PDF) and the structure functions (SFs).
