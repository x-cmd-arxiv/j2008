We clarify the response of extrasolar planetary systems in a 2:1 mean\nmotion commensurability with masses ranging from the super Jovian range to the\nterrestrial range to stochastic forcing that could result from protoplanetary\ndisk turbulence. The behaviour of the different libration modes for a wide\nrange of system parameters and stochastic forcing magnitudes is investigated.\nThe growth of libration amplitudes is parameterized as a function of the\nrelevant physical parameters. The results are applied to provide an explanation\nof the configuration of the HD128311 system.\n  Methods. We first develop an analytic model from first principles without\nmaking the assumption that both eccentricities are small. We also perform\nnumerical N-body simulations with additional stochastic forcing terms to\nrepresent the effects of putative disk turbulence.\n  Results. Systems are quickly destabilized by large magnitudes of stochastic\nforcing but some stability is imparted should systems undergo a net orbital\nmigration. The slow mode, which mostly corresponds to motion of the angle\nbetween the apsidal lines of the two planets, is converted to circulation more\nreadily than the fast mode which is associated with oscillations of the\nsemi-major axes. This mode is also vulnerable to the attainment of small\neccentricities which causes oscillations between periods of libration and\ncirculation.\n  Conclusions. Stochastic forcing due to disk turbulence may have played a role\nin shaping the configurations of observed systems in mean motion resonance. It\nnaturally provides a mechanism for accounting for the HD128311 system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2008 16:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 09:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-14"}

Hence, the solution to the problem of nonuniqueness of\nminimal coupling procedure is argued to be necessary if EC theory is to be\nexperimentally verifiable. It could also enable experimental tests of theories\nbased on EC, such as loop approach to quantisation of gravitational field. Some\nideas of how the arbitrariness incorporated in EC theory could be restricted or\neven eliminated are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2008 17:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2008 13:34:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 20:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Here we generalize the step feature to include\nspace-dependence, allowing it also to model a breakdown of homogeneity and\nisotropy. The space-dependent inflaton potential generates a classical\ncurvature perturbation mode characterized by the wavenumber of the step\ninhomogeneity. For inhomogeneities small compared with the horizon at the step,\nspace-dependence has a small effect on the curvature perturbation. Therefore\nthe smoothly oscillating quantum power spectrum predicted by the homogeneous\nstep is robust with respect to sub-horizon space-dependence. For\ninhomogeneities equal to or greater than the horizon at the step, the\nspace-dependent classical mode can dominate, producing a curvature perturbation\nin which modes of wavenumber determined by the step inhomogeneity are\nsuperimposed on the oscillating power spectrum. Generation of a space-dependent\nstep feature may therefore provide a mechanism to introduce primordial\nanisotropy into the curvature perturbation. Space-dependence also modifies the\nquantum fluctuations, in particular via resonance-like features coming from\nmode coupling to amplified superhorizon modes.

It consists\nof a compact object in the mildly eccentric (e=0.35), 3.9-day orbit around a\nmassive O star. The nature of the compact object is not yet established. In\nthis paper, assuming that the compact object is a black hole, we study the\naccretion of O-star wind by the black hole, by performing three-dimensional\nSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. In order to roughly emulate\nthe effect of the stellar radiation effectively canceling the stellar gravity,\nwe assume that the O star's gravity does not exert on the wind. The wind\nparticles are ejected with half the observed terminal velocity in a narrow\nrange of azimuthal and vertical angles toward the black hole, in order to\nemulate the wind significantly slower than the terminal speed, and optimize the\nresolution and computational efficiency of simulations. We find that the\nmass-accretion rate closely follows the classical Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton\naccretion rate, which is of the order of 10^{16}g/s around periastron. The\naccretion rate at this level would provide jets enough power to produce the\ngamma-rays detected by HESS. Since the accretion peak occurs near the\nperiastron passage, we need a strong gamma-ray absorption around periastron in\norder for the microquasar scenario to be consistent with the observed orbital\nmodulation of the TeV gamma-ray flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2008 18:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-13"}

The radio emission brightened in about\none month, reaching a peak observed flux density of ~100 mJy on 2007 January\n28, and decaying to ~50 mJy by 2007 May when our last monitoring observation\nwas made. Two additional faint, isolated 235 MHz detections were made in\nmid-2006, also with the GMRT. GCRT J1742-3001 is unresolved at each epoch, with\ntypical resolutions of ~20 arcsec x 10 arcsec. No polarization information is\navailable from the observations. Based on nondetections in observations\nobtained simultaneously at 610 MHz, we deduce that the spectrum of GCRT\nJ1742-3001 is very steep, with a spectral index less than about -2. Follow-up\nradio observations in 2007 September at 330 MHz and 1.4 GHz, and in 2008\nFebruary at 235 MHz yielded no detections. No X-ray counterpart is detected in\na serendipitous observation obtained with the X-ray telescope aboard the Swift\nsatellite during the peak of the radio emission in early 2007. We consider the\npossibilities that GCRT J1742-3001 is either a new member of an existing class\nof radio transients, or is representative of a new class having no associated\nX-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2008 20:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The former is a\ntwo-dimensional extension of the traditional two-point correlation function and\nthe latter is related to the ellipticity correlation function used for cosmic\nshear measurements. Both are based on the cross correlation between a sample of\ngalaxies with orientations and a reference sample which represents the\nlarge-scale structure. Applied to the SDSS galaxy catalog the alignment\ncorrelation function reveals an overabundance of reference galaxies along the\nmajor axes of red, luminous (L > L*) galaxies out to projected separations of\n60 Mpc/h. No alignment signal is detected for blue galaxies. The\ncos(2\\theta)-statistic yields very similar results. Starting from a MS\nsemi-analytic galaxy catalog we assign an orientation to each red, luminous and\ncentral galaxy, based on the central region of the host halo. Alternatively, we\nuse the orientation of the host halo itself. We find a mean projected\nmisalignment between a halo and its central region of ~25 deg. Agreement with\nthe SDSS results is good if the central orientations are used. Using the halo\norientations overestimates the observed alignment by more than a factor of 2.\nThe large volume of the MS allows to generate two-dimensional maps of the\nalignment correlation function which show the reference galaxy distribution to\nbe flattened parallel to the orientations of red luminous galaxies with axis\nratios of ~0.5 and ~0.75 for halo and central orientations,respectively.

Our approach explicitly represents the dependency structure among the\nquantitative traits as a network, and leverages this trait network to encode\nstructured regularizations in a multivariate regression model over the\ngenotypes and traits, so that the genetic markers that jointly influence\nsubgroups of highly correlated traits can be detected with high sensitivity and\nspecificity.

We show that the intrinsic superconducting characteristics\ninherent to CePt3Si can be understood in terms of the unconventional\nstrong-coupling state with a line-node gap below T_c= 0.46 K. The mystery about\nthe sample dependence of T_c is explained by the fact that more or less\npolycrystals and single crystals inevitably contain some disordered domains,\nwhich exhibit a conventional BCS s-wave superconductivity (SC) below 0.8 K. In\ncontrast, the Neel temperature T_N= 2.2 K is present regardless of the quality\nof samples, revealing that the Fermi surface responsible for SC differ from\nthat for the antiferromagnetic order. These unusual characteristics of CePt3Si\ncan be also described by a multiband model; in the homogeneous domains, the\ncoherent HF bands are responsible for the unconventional SC, whereas in the\ndisordered domains the conduction bands existing commonly in LaPt3Si may be\nresponsible for the conventional s-wave SC.

We show that such a reduction of entanglement for a\nnon-commutative system arising from the modification of the variances of the\nphase space variables (uncertainty relations) is clearly manifested between two\nparticles that are separated by small distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2008 08:45:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2009 09:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We examine if and how the diversity can be\nexplained, by 1D spherical radiation transport calculations covering a wide\nrange of model parameters (e.g., WD mass).

We suggest that the problem is solved if the progenitor WD, and\nthus the SN explosion, is aspherical. This may reflect a rapid rotation of the\nprogenitor star, likely a consequence of the super-Chandrasekhar-mass WD\nprogenitor.

We consider agents which\ncan classify issues into for or against. The agents arrive at the opinions\nabout each issue in question using an adaptive algorithm. Adaptation comes from\nlearning and the information for the learning process comes from interacting\nwith other neighboring agents and trying to change the internal state in order\nto concur with their opinions. The change in the internal state is driven by\nthe information contained in the issue and in the opinion of the other agent.\nWe present results in a simple yet rich context where each agent uses a Boolean\nPerceptron to state its opinion. If there is no internal clock, so the update\noccurs with asynchronously exchanged information among pairs of agents, then\nthe typical case, if the number of issues is kept small, is the evolution into\na society thorn by the emergence of factions with extreme opposite beliefs.\nThis occurs even when seeking consensus with agents with opposite opinions. The\ncurious result is that it is learning from those that hold the same opinions\nthat drives the emergence of factions. This results follows from the fact that\nfactions are prevented by not learning at all from those agents that hold the\nsame opinion. If the number of issues is large, the dynamics becomes trapped\nand the society does not evolve into factions and a distribution of moderate\nopinions is observed.

Lorenz published his theory equating light vibrations with electric\ncurrents. Starting from Kirchhoff's Ohm's law expression, Lorenz introduces\nscalar potential retardation to obtain an expression for the electric field\nusing retarded potentials. In his theory Lorenz sets the vacuum light speed\nequal to \\sqrt{2}/2 times Weber's measured superluminal value for magnetic\ninduction speed. Using the wave equation Green's function paradigm Lorenz\nreduces his integral, retarded Ohm's law formulation to a differential\nformulation for current density. This represents his solution to the\nelectromagnetic action at a distance problem. During the reduction he presents\na light like, plane wave solution for current density that can not satisfy\ninitial conditions on the expanding wave front and, using a faulty by parts\nintegration that neglects retardation, he develops the eponymic Lorenz\ncondition. Although generally accepted, this condition relates vector and\nscalar potentials erroneously. A proper relation is given and major\nconsequences are developed in appendices. As a finale Lorenz suggests a light\nmodel that I interpret as magnetoinductive waves. Such waves are only now being\nstudied using Kirchhoff's laws without retardation. I redo this important paper\nusing modern day notation with critical annotations. This elevates the paper to\na teaching tool position in the millennial search to understand light's dual\nnature as wave and corpuscle and brings us full circle, back to Kirchhoff's\nlaws where Lorenz began.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2008 14:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-14"}

This variable is most\nappropriate for short symmetric cascade decays involving two-body decays and\non-shell intermediate states which end in standard-model particles and two\ndark-matter particles. An important feature of the constrained mass variables\nis that they do not rely simply on the position of the end point but use the\nadditional information contained in events which lie far from the end point. To\ndemonstrate our method we study the supersymmetric model SPS 1a. We select cuts\nto study events with two Neutralino_2 each of which decays to Neutralino_1, and\ntwo opposite-sign same-flavor (OSSF) charged leptons through an intermediate\non-shell slepton. We find that with 300 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity the\ninvisible-particle mass can be measured to M=96.4 +/- 2.4 GeV.
