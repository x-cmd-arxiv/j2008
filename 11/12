Previous studies found that (i) the spin susceptibility scales linearly\nwith either the temperature $T$ or magnetic field H in the weak-coupling\nregime; (ii) the interaction in the Cooper channel affects this scaling via\nlogarithmic renormalization of prefactors of the $T$, |H| terms, and may even\nreverse the signs of these terms at low enough energies. We show that Cooper\nrenormalization becomes effective only at very low energies, which get even\nsmaller near a QCP. However,even in the absence of such renormalization,\ngeneric (non-Cooper) higher-order processes may also inverse the sign of T,|H|\nscaling. We derive the thermodynamic potential as a function of magnetization\nand show that it contains, in addition to regular terms, a non-analytic |M|^3\nterm, which becomes M^4/T at finite $T$. We show that regular (M^2, M^4, ...)\nterms originate from fermions with energies of order of the bandwidth, while\nthe non-analytic term comes from low-energy fermions. We consider the vicinity\nof a ferromagnetic QCP by generalizing the Eliashberg treatment of the\nspin-fermion model to finite magnetic field, and show that the |M|^3 term\ncrosses over to a non-Fermi-liquid form |M|^{7/2} near a QCP. The prefactor of\nthe |M|^{7/2} term is negative, which indicates that the system undergoes a\nfirst-order rather than a continuous transition to ferromagnetism.

First, we attempt the description of\nthe evolving interface of the aggregates by applying the well-established\nFamily-Vicsek dynamic scaling approach. Systematic deviations from that\nstandard scaling law are observed, suggesting that significant scaling\ncorrections have to be introduced in order to achieve a more accurate\nunderstanding of the behavior of the interface. Subsequently, we study the\ninternal structure of the growing aggregates that can be rationalized in terms\nof the scaling behavior of frozen trees, i.e., structures inhibited for further\ngrowth, lying below the growing interface. It is shown that the rms height\n($h_{s}$) and width ($w_{s}$) of the trees of size $s$ obey power laws of the\nform $h_{s} \\propto s^{\\nu_{\\parallel}}$ and $w_{s} \\propto s^{\\nu_{\\perp}}$,\nrespectively.

The fundamental\nscaling ratios, characteristic of these oscillations, can be linked to the\n(spatial) fundamental scaling ratio of the underlying fractal by means of\nrelationships involving critical exponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2008 17:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It has been pointed out that thermal noise of a mirror with\nmulti-layer coatings can be reduced by mechanical separation of the layers. In\nthis paper, we introduce a way to further reduce thermal noise by locking the\nmechanically separated mirrors. The reduction is limited by the standard\nquantum limit of control noise, but it can be overcome with a\nquantum-non-demolition technique, which finally raises a possibility of\ncomplete elimination of coating thermal noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2008 21:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-31"}

It is shown in this paper that the\nsolution to Lasso, in addition to its sparsity, has robustness properties: it\nis the solution to a robust optimization problem. This has two important\nconsequences. First, robustness provides a connection of the regularizer to a\nphysical property, namely, protection from noise. This allows a principled\nselection of the regularizer, and in particular, generalizations of Lasso that\nalso yield convex optimization problems are obtained by considering different\nuncertainty sets.\n  Secondly, robustness can itself be used as an avenue to exploring different\nproperties of the solution. In particular, it is shown that robustness of the\nsolution explains why the solution is sparse. The analysis as well as the\nspecific results obtained differ from standard sparsity results, providing\ndifferent geometric intuition. Furthermore, it is shown that the robust\noptimization formulation is related to kernel density estimation, and based on\nthis approach, a proof that Lasso is consistent is given using robustness\ndirectly. Finally, a theorem saying that sparsity and algorithmic stability\ncontradict each other, and hence Lasso is not stable, is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2008 22:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-13"}

However, in previous models\nsuggested for grid cell activity, errors accumulate rapidly in the integration\nof velocity inputs. To produce grid-cell like responses, these models would\nrequire frequent resets triggered by external sensory cues, casting doubt on\nthe dead-reckoning potential of the grid cell system. Here we focus on the\naccuracy of path integration in continuous attractor models of grid cell\nactivity. We show, in contrast to previous models, that continuous attractor\nmodels can generate regular triangular grid responses, based on inputs that\nencode only the rat's velocity and heading. We consider the role of the network\nboundary in integration performance, and show that both periodic and aperiodic\nnetworks are capable of accurate path integration, despite important\ndifferences in their attractor manifolds. We show that the rate at which errors\naccumulate in the integration of velocity depends on the network's organization\nand size, and on the intrinsic noise within the network. With a plausible range\nof parameters and the inclusion of spike variability, our model can accurately\nintegrate velocity inputs over a maximum of ~10-100 m and ~1-10 minutes. These\nfindings form a proof-of-concept that continuous attractor dynamics may\nunderlie velocity integration in dMEC. The simulations also generate pertinent\nupper bounds on the accuracy of integration that may be achieved by continuous\nattractor dynamics in the grid cell network.

A recently\ndeveloped general systems theory visualises the eddy continuum underlying\nfractals to result from the growth of large eddies as the integrated mean of\nenclosed small scale eddies, thereby generating a hierarchy of eddy\ncirculations, or an inter-connected network with associated long-range\ncorrelations. The model predictions are as follows: (i) The probability\ndistribution and power spectrum of fractals follow the same inverse power law\nwhich is a function of the golden mean. The predicted inverse power law\ndistribution is very close to the statistical normal distribution for\nfluctuations within two standard deviations from the mean of the distribution.\n(ii) Fractals signify quantumlike chaos since variance spectrum represents\nprobability density distribution, a characteristic of quantum systems such as\nelectron or photon. (ii) Fractal fluctuations of frequency distribution of\nprime numbers signify spontaneous organisation of underlying continuum number\nfield into the ordered pattern of the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern.

The study was done for\na representative sample of radio sources: the nearby (redshift z < 0.5) 3CRR\nsources, and separately for samples of giant radio sources and X-shaped radio\nsources. We find that radio morphological features have a dependence on the\nradio-optical position angle offset and on whether the source is a major- or\nminor-axis source. The evidence indicates an anisotropic galaxy environment,\nrelated to the ellipticity of the host galaxy, that causes the source linear\nsize evolution, strength of backflow in the radio lobes, off-axis lobe\ndistortions and the formation of wings and X-shaped radio sources to depend on\nthe radio-optical position angle offset.
