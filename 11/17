New determinations of solar metal abundances lead SSM\ncalculations to conflict with helioseismological measurements, showing\ndiscrepancies that extend from the convection zone to the solar core and can\nnot be easily assigned to deficiencies in the modelling of the solar convection\nzone. We present updated solar neutrino fluxes and uncertainties for two SSM\nwith high (old) and low (new) solar metallicity determinations. The\nuncertainties in iron and carbon abundances are the largest contribution to the\nuncertainties of the solar neutrino fluxes. The uncertainty on the ^14N+p ->\n^15O+g rate is the largest of the non-composition uncertainties to the CNO\nneutrino fluxes. We propose an independent method to help identify which SSM is\nthe correct one. Present neutrino data can not distinguish the solar neutrino\npredictions of both models but ongoing measurements can help to solve the\npuzzle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2008 18:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-18"}

Stationary waves arise out of this\nregion, but under the additional condition that the relative velocity of the\ncomponents does not exceed some critical value. Under increase of the relative\nvelocity the spectrum of the excitations becomes complex valued and the\nstationary wave pattern is broken. In case of equal velocities two sets of\nstationary waves that correspond to the lower and the upper Bogolyubov mode can\narise.

For a\npassive scalar there is just turbulent diffusion, where the mean flux of\nconcentration depends on the gradient of the mean concentration. However, these\nproportionalities are approximations that are valid only if the mean field or\nthe mean concentration vary slowly in time. Examples are presented where\nturbulent transport possesses memory, i.e. where it depends crucially on the\npast history of the mean field.

The actual performance may depend upon various aspects of the data\nanalysis. In this paper we analyse the impact of specifics of the data analysis\non the actual final results. We also explore the synergies in combining Planck\nresults with future galaxy surveys. We find that Planck will improve\nconstraints on most cosmological parameters by a factor 3-4 and on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio r by a factor 9. Also inflationary parameters, like r,\nn_s and n_run, are no longer degenerate. The tensor spectral index, however, is\nlittle constrained. A combination of the 70 to 143 GHz channels will contain\n~90% of all possible information, with 143 GHz polarisation information\ncarrying about half of the constraining power on r. Also, the error on r\ndegrades by a factor 2 if no B modes are included in the analysis. High-l\ntemperature information is essential for determination of n_s and \\Omega_b,\nwhile improving noise properties increase the l-range where Planck would be\ncosmic variance limited in polarisation, with a significant improvement on the\ndetermination of r, \\tau and A_s. However, a sub-percent difference in the FWHM\nused in the data analysis with respect to the one in the map will result in a\nbias for several parameters. Finally, Planck will greatly help future missions\nlike LSST and CIP reach their potentials by providing tight constraints on\nparameters like n_s and n_run.

In this\nmodel, the observed single LMWDs are the remnants of giant-branch donor stars\nwhose envelopes have been stripped off by the supernova explosion. We\ninvestigate the likely remnants of SNe Ia, including the effects of the\nexplosion on the envelope of the donor star. We also use evolutionary arguments\nto examine alternative formation channels for single LMWDs. In addition, we\ncalculate the expected kinematics of the potential remnants of SNe Ia. SN Ia in\nsystems with giant-branch donor stars can naturally explain the production of\nsingle LMWDs.

Independent of those results, we find that the kinematics of one\npotentially useful population containing single LMWDs is consistent with our\nmodel.

The existence of single LMWDs appears to\nconstitute evidence for the production of SNe Ia in binary systems with a\nred-giant donor star.

We\nestimate the baryonic mass in the outskirts of galaxy clusters which is\ndifficult to observe because of low electron temperature and density in these\nregions.

During the Suzaku observation, IGR J17497-2821\nis very bright, 2 x 10^37 erg/s at 8 kpc in the 1-300 keV range, and shows a\nhard spectrum, typical of black hole candidates in the low-hard state. Despite\nthe multi-mission X-ray monitoring of the source, only with Suzaku is it\npossible to obtain a broad-band spectrum in the 1-300 keV range with a very\nhigh signal to noise ratio. A sum of a multi-color disc (DISKBB) and a thermal\nComptonization component (COMPPS) with mild reflection is a good representation\nof our IGR J17497-2821 Suzaku spectrum.

ELKO spinor fields are prime candidates for\ndescribing dark matter, and belong to a wider class of spinor fields, the\nso-called flagpole spinor fields, corresponding to the class-(5), according to\nLounesto spinor field classification, based on the relations and values taken\nby their associated bilinear covariants. Such a mapping between Dirac and ELKO\nspinor fields was obtained in an attempt to extend the Standard Model in order\nto encompass dark matter. Now we prove that such a mapping, analogous to the\ninstanton Hopf fibration map $S^3... S^7\\to S^4$, prevents ELKO to describe the\ninstanton, giving a suitable physical interpretation to ELKO. We review ELKO\nspinor fields as type-(5) spinor fields under the Lounesto spinor field\nclassification, explicitly computing the associated bilinear covariants.

Employing the Lagrangian models of the nonlinear-$\\sigma$ model\n(NL$\\sigma$), the scalar-vector interaction model (SVI) and the\n$\\sigma$-$\\omega$ coupling model (SIGO), we show that each Lagrangian model\nexhibits a distinctly different GMR response. Consequently, Lagrangian models\nyield a different value of the GMR energy for a given value of the nuclear\nmatter incompressibility $K_\\infty$. It is shown that this effect arises\nlargely from a different value of the surface incompressibility $K_{surf}$\ninherent to each Lagrangian model, thus giving rise to the ratio\n$K_{surf}/K_\\infty$ which depends upon the Lagrangian model used. This is\nattributed to a difference in the density dependence of the meson masses and\nhence to the density dependence of the nuclear interaction amongst various\nLagrangian models. The sensitivity of the GMR energy to the Lagrangian model\nused and thus emergence of a multitude of GMR energies for a given value of\n$K_\\infty$ renders the method of extracting $K_\\infty$ on the basis of\ninterpolation amongst forces as inappropriate. As a remedy, the need to\n'calibrate' the density dependence of the nuclear interaction in the RMF theory\nis proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2008 15:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-23"}
