Much of the emission from any star-forming region will\noriginate from such interfaces, so the Bar serves as a foundation test of any\nemission model. Here we combine X-ray, optical, IR and radio data sets to\nderive emission spectra along the transition from H+ to H0 to H2 regions. We\nthen reproduce the spectra of these layers with a simulation that\nsimultaneously accounts for the detailed microphysics of the gas, the grains,\nand molecules, especially H2 and CO. The magnetic field, observed to be the\ndominant pressure in another region of the Orion Nebula, is treated as a free\nparameter, along with the density of cosmic rays. Our model successfully\naccounts for the optical, IR and radio observations across the Bar by including\na significant magnetic pressure and also heating by an excess density of cosmic\nrays, which we suggest is due to cosmic rays being trapped in the compressed\nmagnetic field. In the Orion Bar, as we had previously found in M17, momentum\ncarried by radiation and winds from the newly formed stars pushes back and\ncompresses the surrounding gas. There is a rough balance between outward\nmomentum in starlight and the total pressure in atomic and molecular gas\nsurrounding the H+ region. If the gas starts out with a weak magnetic field,\nthe starlight from a newly formed cluster will push back the gas and compress\nthe gas, magnetic field, and cosmic rays until magnetic pressure becomes an\nimportant factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2008 16:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2008 17:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

A recently developed microeconomic model for the\npersonal income distribution and its evolution and a simple functional\nrelationship between the rate of the per capita GDP growth and the attained\nlevel of the per capita GDP are used to describe the transition process. The\ndeveloped transition model contains only three defining parameters and\ndescribes the process of real GDP per capita evolution during the last 15\nyears. It is found that the transition process finished in the Central European\ncountries several years ago and their economic evolution is defined by pure\ncapitalist rules. In the long run, this means that the future of these\ncountries has to follow the same path, i.e. dependence on the per capita GDP\ngrowth rate of the per capita GDP itself, as the developed countries have had\nin the past. If the best GDP evolution scenario occurs for the studied\ncountries, they will be able to maintain the absolute lag in per capita GDP\nrelative to most developed countries including the USA. But they will never\ncatch the advanced countries if they follow the same rules of development. In\nRussia and some countries of the Former Soviet Union the transition process is\nstill far from complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2008 17:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

In this contribution, we show that the\ngeometry of topographic isolines is an appropriate observable to help\ndisentangle such a relationship.

We present steady-state solutions in the radiative\ndiffusion approximation for the radiation field trapped in a clump of gas and\nshow that this may result in an enhancement, by a factor of up to 10^6, of the\nstrength of the Wouthuysen-Field effect over that obtained from the\nfree-streaming limit. Solutions to the time-dependent diffusion equation,\nhowever, suggest that the timescales required to reach such a steady state will\ngenerally exceed the source lifetimes. In the presence of internal expansion, a\nsteady state may be established as photons are redshifted into the red wing,\nand significant enhancement in the scattering rate may again be produced.\nAlternatively, a substantial scattering rate may arise in systems with a\npeculiar motion away from the source that redshifts the received radiation into\nthe resonance line centre. As a consequence, at epochs z<30, when collisional\ndecoupling is small except in dense regions, and prior to the establishment of\nany large-scale diffuse radiation field of resonance line photons, the 21cm\nsignature from the Intergalactic Medium produced by the Wouthuysen-Field effect\nwill in general trace the peculiar velocity field of the gas in addition to its\ndensity structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2008 17:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The edges are sharp, and the axes of symmetry of the edges\nare roughly anti-parallel, suggesting that these galaxies are falling towards\none another in the plane of the sky. The detection of merger cold fronts\nimplies a merging subgroup scenario, since the alternative is that the galaxies\nare falling into a pre-existing $\\sim1$ keV halo without a dominant galaxy of\nits own, and such objects are not observed.

One existing algorithm will\npartition a typical active region into a number of unipolar regions ranging\nfrom a few dozen to a few hundred, depending on algorithmic parameters. This\nwork explores how the properties of the partitions depend on some algorithmic\nparameters, and how connectivity depends on the coarseness of partitioning for\none particular active region magnetogram. We find the number of connections\namong them scales with the number of regions even as the number of possible\nconnections scales with its square.\n  There are several methods of generating a coronal field, even a potential\nfield. The field may be computed inside conducting boundaries or over an\ninfinite half-space. For computation of connectivity, the unipolar regions may\nbe replaced by point sources or the exact magnetogram may be used as a lower\nboundary condition. Our investigation shows that the connectivities from these\nvarious fields differ only slightly -- no more than 15%. The greatest\ndifference is between fields within conducting walls and those in the\nhalf-space. Their connectivities grow more different as finer partitioning\ncreates more source regions. This also gives a quantitative means of\nestablishing how far away conducting boundaries must be placed in order not to\nsignificantly affect the extrapolation. For identical outer boundaries, the use\nof point sources instead of the exact magnetogram makes a smaller difference in\nconnectivity: typically 6% independent of the number of source regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Nov 2008 00:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

EDSR is\nmediated by spin-orbit interaction (SOI), which couples the spin degree of\nfreedom and the momentum vector.

We investigate the dependence of the\ngas accretion rate upon the planetary core mass, and the surface density and\nopacity of the encompassing protoplanetary disc. Accretion of planetesimals is\nneglected.\n  We find that high-mass protoplanets are surrounded by thick circumplanetary\ndiscs during their gas accretion phase but, contrary to locally-isothermal\ncalculations, discs do not form around accreting protoplanets with masses ~<\n50M_Earth when radiation hydrodynamical simulations are performed, even if the\ngrain opacity is reduced from interstellar values by a factor of 100. We find\nthat the opacity of the gas plays a large role in determining the accretion\nrates for low-mass planetary cores. For example, reducing the opacities from\ninterstellar values by a factor of 100 leads to roughly an order of magnitude\nincrease in the accretion rates for 10-20M_Earth protoplanets. The dependence\non opacity becomes less important in determining the accretion rate for more\nmassive cores where gravity dominates the effects of thermal support and the\nprotoplanet is essentially accreting at the runaway rate. Finally, for low-mass\nplanetary cores (~< 20M_Earth), we obtain accretion rates that are in agreement\nwith previous one-dimensional quasi-static models.

Although\nthe spacetime with base space $S^{2}\\times S^{2}$ has curvature singularity at\n$r=N$, which does not admit NUT solutions, we may proceed with the same\ncomputations as in the $\\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ case. The investigation of\nthermodynamics of NUT/Bolt solutions in six dimensions is carried out. We\ncompute the finite action, mass, entropy, and temperature of the black hole.\nThen the validity of the first law of thermodynamics is demonstrated. It is\nshown that in NUT solutions all thermodynamic quantities for both base spaces\nare related to each other by substituting\n$\\alpha^{\\mathbb{CP}^{k}}=[(k+1)/k]\\alpha^{S^{2} \\times S^{2}\\times\n>...S_{k}^{2}}$. So no further information is given by investigating NUT\nsolution in the $S^{2}\\times S^{2}$ case. This relation is not true for bolt\nsolutions. A generalization of the thermodynamics of black holes to arbitrary\neven dimensions is made using a new method based on the Gibbs-Duhem relation\nand Gibbs free energy for NUT solutions. According to this method, the finite\naction in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet is obtained by considering the generalized\nfinite action in Einstein gravity with an additional term as a function of\n$\\alpha$. Stability analysis is done by investigating the heat capacity and\nentropy in the allowed range of $\\alpha$, $\\Lambda$ and $N$. For NUT solutions\nin $d$ dimensions, there exist a stable phase at a narrow range of $\\alpha$. In\nsix-dimensional Bolt solutions, metric is completely stable for\n$\\mathcal{B}=S^{2}\\times S^{2}$, and is completely unstable for\n$\\mathcal{B}=\\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Nov 2008 15:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 10:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-20"}

We calculate geometrical and\nenergetic characteristics of the localized state of a gas confined in a large\nbox or in a harmonic trap. Different regimes of the localized state are found\ndepending on the ratio of two characteristic length scales of the disorder, the\nLarkin length and the disorder correlation length. Repulsing bosons confined in\na large box with average density $n$ well below a critical value $n_c$ are\ntrapped in deep potential wells of extension much smaller than distance between\nthem. Tunneling between these wells is exponentially small. The ground state of\nsuch a gas is a random singlet with no long-range phase correlation For $n>n_c$\nrepulsion between particles overcomes the disorder and the gas transits from\nthe localized to a coherent superfluid state. The critical density $n_c$ is\ncalculated in terms of the disorder parameters and the interaction strength.\nFor atoms in traps four different regimes are found, only one of it is\nsuperfluid. The theory is extended to lower (1 and 2) dimensions. Its\nquantitative predictions can be checked in experiments with ultracold atomic\ngases and other Bose-systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Nov 2008 15:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
