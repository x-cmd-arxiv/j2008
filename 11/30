In the\nstandard picture, all gas is initially heated to the virial temperature of the\ngalaxy as it enters the virial radius. Low mass galaxies are instead dominated\nby accretion of gas that stays well below the virial temperature, and even when\na hot halo is able to develop in more massive galaxies there exist dense\nfilaments that penetrate inside of the virial radius and deliver cold gas to\nthe central galaxy. For galaxies up to ~L*, this cold accretion gas is\nresponsible for the star formation in the disk at all times to the present.\nEven for galaxies at higher masses, cold flows dominate the growth of the disk\nat early times. Within this modified picture, galaxies are able to accrete a\nlarge mass of cold gas, with lower initial gas temperatures leading to shorter\ncooling times to reach the disk. Although star formation in the disk is\nmitigated by supernovae feedback, the short cooling times allow for the growth\nof stellar disks at higher redshifts than predicted by the standard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2008 18:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The validation is lastly performed in the case\nof a water hammer in a uniform pipe: we compare the numerical results provided\nby an industrial code used at EDF-CIH (France), which solves the Allievi\nequation (the commonly used equation for pressurised flows in pipes) by the\nmethod of characteristics, with those of the kinetic scheme.

In this paper\nwe present results from our photometric campaign dedicated to studying the\nchanging morphology of the optical light curves. We find that the optical light\ncurves show remarkable evidence for strongly evolving light curve shapes. In\naddition we find that these changes show a modulation at a period of $\\sim$ 5\ndays. We interpret these changes as either due to strong periodic accretion\ndisc warping or other geometrical changes due to disc precession at a period of\n5 days. Finally, we have detected 11 new optical bursts, the phase distribution\nof which supports the idea of a vertically extended asymmetric accretion disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 2008 10:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The classical vC-Z theorem is the theoretical\nfoundation of radio astronomical interferometry, and its application is the\nbasis of interferometric imaging. Existing generalised vC-Z theorems in radio\nastronomy assume, however, either paraxiality (narrow FoV) or scalar\n(unpolarized) sources. Our theorem uses neither of these assumptions, which are\nseldom fulfilled in practice in radio astronomy, and treats the full\nelectromagnetic field. To handle wide, partially polarized fields, we extend\nthe two-dimensional electric field (Jones vector) formalism of the standard\n\"Measurement Equation\" of radio astronomical interferometry to the full\nthree-dimensional formalism developed in optical coherence theory. The\nresulting vC-Z theorem enables all-sky imaging in a single telescope pointing,\nand imaging using not only standard dual-polarized interferometers (that\nmeasure 2-D electric fields), but also electric tripoles and electromagnetic\nvector-sensor interferometers. We show that the standard 2-D Measurement\nEquation is easily obtained from our formalism in the case of dual-polarized\nantenna element interferometers. We find, however, that such dual-polarized\ninterferometers can have polarimetric aberrations at the edges of the FoV that\nare often correctable.
