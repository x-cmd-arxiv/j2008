The universal synchronization primitives that have been deployed\nwidely in conventional architectures like CAS and LL/SC are expected to reach\ntheir scalability limits in the evolution to many-core architectures with\nthousands of cores. We introduce a non-blocking full/empty bit primitive, or\nNB-FEB for short, as a promising synchronization primitive for parallel\nprogramming on may-core architectures. We show that the NB-FEB primitive is\nuniversal, scalable, feasible and convenient to use. NB-FEB, together with\nregisters, can solve the consensus problem for an arbitrary number of processes\n(universality). NB-FEB is combinable, namely its memory requests to the same\nmemory location can be combined into only one memory request, which\nconsequently mitigates performance degradation due to synchronization \"hot\nspots\" (scalability). Since NB-FEB is a variant of the original full/empty bit\nthat always returns a value instead of waiting for a conditional flag, it is as\nfeasible as the original full/empty bit, which has been implemented in many\ncomputer systems (feasibility). The original full/empty bit is well-known as a\nspecial-purpose primitive for fast producer-consumer synchronization and has\nbeen used extensively in the specific domain of applications. In this paper, we\nshow that NB-FEB can be deployed easily as a general-purpose primitive.

To this aim, we\npresent an adaptive strategy that, based on a potential that the network\nsystems seek to minimize in order to maintain synchronization, can be\nsuccessfully applied to identify the time evolution of the network from limited\ninformation. This strategy takes advantage of the properties of synchronism of\nchaos and of the presence of different communication delays over the network\nlinks. As a motivating example we consider a network of sensors surveying an\narea, in which information regarding the time evolution of the network\nconnections can be used, e.g., to detect changes taking place within the area.\nWe propose two different setups for our strategy. In the first one,\nsynchronization has to be achieved at each node (as well as the identification\nof the couplings over the network links), based solely on a single scalar\nsignal representing a superposition of signals from the other nodes in the\nnetwork. In the second one, we incorporate an additional node, termed the\nmaestro, having the function of maintaining network synchronization. We will\nsee that when such an arrangement is realized, it will become possible to\neffectively identify the time evolution of networks that are much larger than\nwould be possible in the absence of a maestro.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2008 12:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, the readout achieved using a single\ntransverse cavity mode is not sensitive enough to observe quantum jumps between\nphonon Fock states.\n  Here we demonstrate an $x^2$-sensitivity that is orders of magnitude stronger\nusing two transverse cavity modes that are nearly degenerate. We derive a\nfirst-order perturbation theory to describe the interactions between\nnearly-degenerate cavity modes and achieve good agreement with our measurements\nusing realistic parameters.
