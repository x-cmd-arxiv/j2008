The spectral estimate, which assumes\nthat the extrapolated field is random, homogeneous and has Gaussian statistics,\nis found here to be relatively accurate for quiet Sun magnetograms from SOHO's\nMDI. The majority of null points occur at low altitudes, and their distribution\nis dictated by high wavenumbers in the Fourier spectrum. This portion of the\nspectrum is affected by Poisson noise, and as many as five-sixths of null\npoints identified from a direct extrapolation can be attributed to noise. The\nnull distribution above 1500 km is found to depend on wavelengths that are\nreliably measured by MDI in either its low-resolution or high-resolution mode.\nAfter correcting the spectrum to remove white noise and compensate for the\nmodulation transfer function we find that a potential field extrapolation\ncontains, on average, one magnetic null point, with altitude greater than 1.5\nMm, above every 322 square Mm patch of quiet Sun.

Five different time reversal mirrors (TRM) are introduced and their\nrelations are analyzed. For the boundary behavior, it is shown that for\nparaxial wave only the monopole TR scheme satisfies the exact boundary\ncondition while for spherical wave only one of the mixed mode TR scheme, after\nmultiplication by two, satisfies the exact boundary condition. The asymptotic\nanalysis of the near-field focusing property is presented. It is shown that to\nhave a subwavelength focal spot the TRM should involve dipole fields. The\nmonopole TR is extremely ineffective to focus below wavelength as the focal\nspot size decreases logarithmically with the distance between the source and\nTRM. Contrary to the matched field processing and the phase processor, both of\nwhich resemble TR, TR in a weak- or non-scattering medium is usually biased in\nthe longitudinal direction, especially when TR is carried out on a {\\em single}\nplane with a {finite} aperture. This is true for all five TR schemes. On the\nother hand, the TR focal spot has been shown repeatedly in the literature, both\ntheoretically and experimentally, to be centered at the source point when the\nmedium is multiply scattering. A reconciliation of the two seemingly\nconflicting results is found in the random fluctuations in the intensity of the\nGreen function for a multiply scattering medium and the notion of\nscattering-enlarged effective aperture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2008 06:11:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 15:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Indeed, a finite\nfamily of linear forms is naturally identified to a locally geodesic ray in a\nspace $T_n$ and the way this family is approximated is reflected by the heights\nat which the ray rises in the cuspidal end. The only difference between the two\ntypes of approximation appearing in a Transference Theorem is that the height\nis measured with respect to different rays in $W$, a Weyl chamber in $T_n$.\nThus the Transference Theorem is equivalent to a relation between the Busemann\nfunctions of two rays in $W$. This relation is easy to establish on $W$,\nbecause restricted to it the two Busemann functions become two linear forms.\nSince $T_n$ is at finite Hausdorff distance from $W$, the same relation is\nsatisfied up to a bounded perturbation on the whole of $T_n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2008 14:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-04"}

Here we present high angular resolution observations of the emission\nof $^{12}$CO and its isotopomer $^{13}$CO J=2--1 line from the circumstellar\nenvelope around the binary post-AGB star IRAS 08544$-$4431, which is one of the\nmost prominent members of this class of objects. We find that the envelope is\nresolved in our observations and two separate components can be identified: (a)\na central extended and strong component with very narrow linewidth between 2 -\n6 \\kms; (b) a weak bipolar outflow with expansion velocity up to 8 \\kms. The\ncentral compact component possesses low and variable $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO J=2--1\nline ratio, indicating optically thick emission of the main isotope. We\nestimate a molecular gas mass of 0.0047 M$_\\odot$ for this component based on\nthe optically thinner $^{13}$CO J=2--1 line.
