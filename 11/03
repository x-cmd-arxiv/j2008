This is clearly too long to be\nassociated with radiative cooling. Here we propose that this may be the\nsignature of deceleration of the synchrotron emitting jet component. We develop\na model analogous to the relativistic blast wave model for GRBs, including\nradiative energy losses and radiation drag, to simulate the deceleration of a\nrelativistically moving plasmoid in the moderately dense AGN environment.\nSynchrotron, SSC and external Compton emission are evaluated self-consistently.\nWe show that the observed optical light curve decay can be successfully\nreproduced with this model. The decelerating plasmoid model predicts a delayed\nX-ray flare, about 2 - 3 weeks after the onset of the quasi-exponential light\ncurve decay in the optical. A robust prediction of this model, which can be\ntested with Fermi and simultaneous optical monitoring, is that the peak in the\ngamma-ray light curve at ~ 100 MeV is expected to be delayed by a few days with\nrespect to the onset of the optical decay, while the VHE gamma-rays are\nexpected to track the optical light curve closely with a delay of at most a few\nhours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 15:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Unlike previous work, our\nprimary interest is in the possible many-body structures that may be generated,\nsome of which may include interesting but known structures, while others may\nrepresent entirely new structural motifs. Soft matter systems, such as colloids\nand polymers, offer a versatile means of realizing the optimized interactions.\nIt is shown that these inverse approaches hold great promise for controlling\nself-assembly to a degree that surpasses the less-than-optimal path that nature\nhas provided.

The expected physical properties of outer solar\nsystem materials (high porosity, mixed ice-rock composition, and low material\nstrength) pose significant computational challenges. We present results from\ncatastrophic small body collisions using a new hybrid hydrocode to $N$-body\ncode computational technique. This method allows detailed modeling of shock\npropagation and material modification as well as gravitational reaccumulation.\nHere, we consider a wide range of material strengths to span the possible range\nof Kuiper belt objects. We find that the shear strength of the target is\nimportant in determining the collision outcome for 2 to 50-km radius bodies,\nwhich are traditionally thought to be in a pure gravity regime. The\ncatastrophic disruption and dispersal criteria, $Q_D^*$, can vary by up to a\nfactor of three between strong crystalline and weak aggregate materials. The\nmaterial within the largest reaccumulated remnants experiences a wide range of\nshock pressures. The dispersal and reaccumulation process results in the\nmaterial on the surfaces of the largest remnants having experienced a wider\nrange of shock pressures compared to material in the interior. Hence, depending\non the initial structure and composition, the surface materials on large,\nreaccumulated bodies in the outer solar system may exhibit complex spectral and\nalbedo variations. Finally, we present revised catastrophic disruption criteria\nfor a range of impact velocities and material strengths for outer solar system\nbodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2008 16:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-04"}

With simplifications we are led to a hybrid\nSDE mixing both arithmetic and geometric Brownian motions, whose solution is\ngiven by a class of integrals of exponentials of one Brownian motion against\nanother, in forms considered by Yor and collaborators.

The effect of the\nincreased energy generation is to reduce the evolution time to the peak of the\nTNR and, thereby, the accreted mass as compared to the evolutionary sequences\ndone without this reaction included.

We\nconsider a non-stationary random signal, where samples can be classified into\nseveral different classes, and samples in each class are identically\nindependently distributed with an unknown probability distribution. The problem\nto be solved is to estimate the probability distributions of the classes and\nthe correct membership of the samples to the classes. We propose a signal\nclassification method based on the data compression principle that the accurate\nestimation in the classification problems induces the optimal signal models for\ndata compression. The method formulates the classification problem as an\noptimization problem, where a so called {\"classification gain\"} is maximized.\nIn order to circumvent the difficulties in integer optimization, we propose a\ncontinuous relaxation based algorithm. It is proven in this paper that\nasymptotically vanishing optimality loss is incurred by the continuous\nrelaxation. We show by simulation results that the proposed algorithm is\neffective, robust and has low computational complexity. The proposed algorithm\ncan be applied to solve various multimedia signal segmentation, analysis, and\npattern recognition problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 02:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 20:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-02"}

One of the key\nscience objectives of the SKA is to provide exquisite strong-field tests of\ngravitational physics by finding and timing pulsars in extreme binary systems\nsuch as a pulsar-black hole binary. To find out how three preliminary SKA\nconfigurations will affect a pulsar survey, we have simulated SKA pulsar\nsurveys for each configuration. We estimate that the total number of normal\npulsars the SKA will detect, using only the 1-km core and 30 minutes\nintegration time, is around 14000 normal pulsar and 6000 millisecond pulsars.\nWe describe a simple strategy for follow-up timing observations and find that,\ndepending on the configuration, it would take 1-6 days to obtain a single\ntiming point for 14000 pulsars. Obtaining a single timing point for the\nhigh-precision timing projects of the SKA, will take less than 14 hours, 2\ndays, or 3 days, depending on the configuration. The presence of aperture\narrays will be of great benefit here. We also study the computational\nrequirements for beam forming and data analysis for a pulsar survey. Beam\nforming of the full field of view of the single-pixel feed 15-m dishes using\nthe 1-km core of the SKA requires about 2.2*10^15 operations per second. The\ncorresponding data rate from such a pulsar survey is about 4.7*10^11 bytes per\nsecond. The required computational power for a deep real time analysis is\nestimated to be 1.2*10^16 operations per second. For an aperture array or\ndishes equipped with phased array feeds, the survey can be performed faster,\nbut the computational requirements and data rates will go up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 03:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This population is\ndescribed by a stochastic Lotka-Volterra system, obtained as limit of\nrenormalized interacting birth and death processes. The weak cooperation\nassumption allows the system not to blow up. We study the existence and\nuniqueness of a quasi-stationary distribution, that is convergence to\nequilibrium conditioned to non extinction. To this aim we generalize in\ntwo-dimensions spectral tools developed for one-dimensional generalized Feller\ndiffusion processes. The existence proof of a quasi-stationary distribution is\nreduced to the one for a $d$-dimensional Kolmogorov diffusion process under a\nsymmetry assumption. The symmetry we need is satisfied under a local balance\ncondition relying the ecological rates. A novelty is the outlined relation\nbetween the uniqueness of the quasi-stationary distribution and the\nultracontractivity of the killed semi-group. By a comparison between the\nkilling rates for the populations of each type and the one of the global\npopulation, we show that the quasi-stationary distribution can be either\nsupported by individuals of one (the strongest one) type or supported by\nindividuals of the two types. We thus highlight two different long time\nbehaviors depending on the parameters of the model: either the model exhibits\nan intermediary time scale for which only one type (the dominant trait) is\nsurviving, or there is a positive probability to have coexistence of the two\nspecies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 08:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-04"}

In addition to this, a fluid model is presented that is\ncapable of capturing both of these features that are missing in the\napproximative kinetic description, i.e., two (fast and slow) ion acoustic\nmodes, and the corresponding Landau damping of both modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 09:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In\ncases with enough supersymmetry it has been possible to explicitly construct\nthese microstates in spacetime, and understand how coarse-graining of\nnon-singular, horizon-free objects can lead to an effective description as an\nextremal black hole.

The static distribution\nof tagged molecule potential energies shows a clear multimodal structure with\nthree distinct peaks, similar to those observed previously in water and liquid\nsilica. The multimodality is shown to originate from electrostatic effects, but\nnot from local, hydrogen-bond interactions. An interesting outcome of this\nstudy is the remarkable similarity in the tagged potential energy power spectra\nof methanol, water and silica, despite the differences in the underlying\ninteractions and the dimensionality of the network. All three liquids show a\ndistinct multiple time scale (MTS) regime with a 1/f dependence with a clear\npositive correlation between the scaling exponent alpha and the diffusivity.\nThe low-frequency limit of the MTS regime is determined by the frequency of\ncrossover to white noise behaviour which occurs at approximately 0.1 cm{-1} in\nthe case of methanol under standard temperature and pressure conditions. The\npower spectral regime above 200 cm{-1} in all three systems is dominated by\nresonances due to localised vibrations, such as librations. The correlation\nbetween $\\alpha$ and the diffusivity in all three liquids appears to be related\nto the strength of the coupling between the localised motions and the larger\nlength/time-scale network reorganizations.

On the contrary the condensate Jacobi-type internal density matrix\ngives complete condensation into a single state. The internal one-particle\ndensity matrix is, therefore, shown to be different in general for different\nchoices of the internal coordinate system. We propose two physically motivated\ncriteria for the choice of the adequate coordinate systems which give us a\nunique answer for the internal one-particle density matrix. One criterion is\nthat in the infinite particle number limit ($N=\\infty$) the internal\none-particle density matrix should have the same eigenvalues and eigenfunctions\nas those of the corresponding ideal Bose-Einstein condensate in the laboratory\nframe. The other criterion is that the coordinate of the internal one-particle\ndensity matrix should be orthogonal to the remaining $(N - 2)$ internal\ncoordinates. This second criterion is shown to imply the first criterion. It is\nshown that the internal Jacobi coordinate system satisfies these two criteria\nwhile the internal coordinate system adopted by Pethick and Pitaevskii for the\nconstruction of the internal one-particle density matrix does not. It is\ndemonstrated that these two criteria uniquely determine the internal\none-particle density matrix which is identical to that calculated with the\nJacobi coordinates.

This method relies on a Taylor expansion of the\ntrigonometric functions. It yields the Fourier modes from a number of FFTs,\nwhich is controlled by the order N of the expansion and by the dimension D of\nthe system. In three dimensions, for the practical value N=3, the number of\nFFTs required is 20. We apply the method to the measurement of the power\nspectrum of a periodic point distribution that is a local Poisson realization\nof an underlying stationary field. We derive explicit analytic expression for\nthe spectrum, which allows us to quantify--and correct for--the biases induced\nby discreteness and by the truncation of the Taylor expansion, and to bound the\nunknown effects of aliasing of the power spectrum. We show that these aliasing\neffects decrease rapidly with the order N. The only remaining significant\nsource of errors is reduced to the unavoidable cosmic/sample variance due to\nthe finite size of the sample. The analytical calculations are successfully\nchecked against a cosmological N-body experiment. We also consider the initial\nconditions of this simulation, which correspond to a perturbed grid. This\nallows us to test a case where the local Poisson assumption is incorrect. Even\nin that extreme situation, the third-order Fourier-Taylor estimator behaves\nwell. We also show how to reach arbitrarily large dynamic range in Fourier\nspace (i.e., high wavenumber), while keeping statistical errors in control, by\nappropriately \"folding\" the particle distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 15:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This calls for a\nstronger need to improve on the accuracy of interatomic potentials, and in\nparticular the usually rather inaccurate inner-range potentials. A boundary\ncondition for this inner range can be conveniently given via the accumulated\nphase method. However, in this approach one should satisfy two conditions,\nwhich are in principle conflicting, and the validity of these approximations\ncomes under stress when higher precision is required. We show that a better\ncompromise between the two is possible by allowing for an adiabatic change of\nthe hyperfine mixing of singlet and triplet states for interatomic distances\nsmaller than the separation radius. A mass scaling approach to relate\naccumulated phase parameters in a combined analysis of isotopically related\natom pairs is described in detail and its accuracy is estimated, taking into\naccount both Born-Oppenheimer and WKB breakdown.
