As\nhas been shown before, the 1D VM equilibrium equations are equivalent to the\nmotion of a pseudo-particle in a conservative pseudo-potential, with the\npseudo-potential being proportional to one of the diagonal components of the\nplasma pressure tensor. The basic equations are here derived in a different way\nto previous work. Based on this theoretical framework, a necessary condition on\nthe pseudo-potential (plasma pressure) to allow for force-free 1D VM equilibria\nis formulated. It is shown that linear force-free 1D VM solutions, which so far\nare the only force-free 1D VM solutions known, correspond to the case where the\npseudo-potential is an attractive central potential. A general class of\ndistribution functions leading to central pseudo-potentials is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2008 18:57:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 15:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-25"}

Gas disc dispersal is simulated in a\nsimple manner by assuming global exponential decay of the disc mass, leading to\nthe stalling of migration after semi-major axes have approximately halved from\ntheir initial values. We consider Trojan pairs with different initial masses\nand gas accretion rates and gas disc models with different masses and\nviscosities. An N-body code, adapted to model disc forces, is used to examine\nlarge-scale migration and the formation of very short period Trojan planets.\nFor each combination of planetary pair and disc model that we consider in our\nhydrodynamic simulations, each Trojan system remains stable before, during, and\nafter disc dispersal. The long-term stability of these systems in the absence\nof gas is tested using N-body simulations, and all systems remain stable for\nthose evolution times equal to 10^9 years. Eccentricities remain low (e<0.02)\nin all cases. Increases in the amplitude of libration about the L4/L5 Lagrange\npoints accompany the inward migration, and during very large-scale migration\nTrojan systems may be disrupted prior to the onset of disc dispersal. The\nstability of Trojan pairs during rapid type I migration, during the transition\nto type II migration with the accompanying gap formation in the gas disc, and\nduring gas loss when the disc disperses, indicates that isolated Trojan planet\nsystems are very stable.

A\ncomplete and abrupt loss of the entanglement, called the entanglement sudden\ndeath, can be found to occur for the spin correlated states, but the\nentanglement evolves without any discontinuity or decays asymptotically for the\nspin anti-correlated states. We consider the evolution of an initial\nentanglement encoded in the spin anti-correlated states and demonstrate that\nthe asymptotic behavior predicted before occurs only in the weak coupling limit\nor equivalently when the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is made on the\ninteraction Hamiltonian of the qubits with the field. If we do not restrict\nourselves to the RWA, we find that the entanglement undergoes a discontinuity,\nthe sudden death phenomenon. We illustrate this behavior by employing an\nefficient scheme for entanglement evolution between two cold-trapped atoms\nlocated inside a single-mode cavity. Although only a single excitation is\ninitially present in the system, we find that the two-photon excited state,\nwhich plays the key role for the discontinuity in the behavior of the\nentanglement, gains a population over a short time of the evolution. When the\nRWA is made on the interaction, the two-photon excited state remains\nunpopulated for all times and the discontinuity is absent. We attribute this\nphenomenon to the principle of complementarity between the evolution time and\nenergy, and the presence of the counter-rotating terms in the interaction\nHamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2008 00:24:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2009 03:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Observations and analysis of solar-type oscillations in red-giant\nstars is an emerging aspect of asteroseismic analysis with a number of open\nquestions yet to be explored. Although stochastic oscillations have previously\nbeen detected in red giants from both radial velocity and photometric\nmeasurements, those data were either too short or had sampling that was not\ncomplete enough to perform a detailed data analysis of the variability. The\nquality and quantity of photometric data as provided by the CoRoT satellite is\nnecessary to provide a breakthrough in observing p-mode oscillations in red\ngiants. We have analyzed continuous photometric time-series of about 11 400\nrelatively faint stars obtained in the exofield of CoRoT during the first 150\ndays long-run campaign from May to October 2007. We find several hundred stars\nshowing a clear power excess in a frequency and amplitude range expected for\nred-giant pulsators. In this paper we present first results on a sub-sample of\nthese stars. Aims. Knowing reliable fundamental parameters like mass and radius\nis essential for detailed asteroseismic studies of red-giant stars. As the\nCoRoT exofield targets are relatively faint (11-16 mag) there are no (or only\nweak) constraints on the star's location in the H-R diagram. We therefore aim\nto extract information about such fundamental parameters solely from the\navailable time series. Methods. We model the convective background noise and\nthe power excess hump due to pulsation with a global model fit and deduce\nreliable estimates for the stellar mass and radius from scaling relations for\nthe frequency of maximum oscillation power and the characteristic frequency\nseparation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2008 09:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 23:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-24"}

This fusion operates before the query processing (retrieval) and\nworks at an UMLS-compliant conceptual indexing level. Our purpose is to study\nvarious techniques related to semantic data alignment, preprocessing, fusion,\nclustering and retrieval, by evaluating the various techniques and highlighting\nfuture research directions.

In particular, solar-wind sputtering is one\nof the most important agents for the surface erosion of a Near-Earth Object\n(NEO), acting together with other surface release processes, such as Photon\nStimulated Desorption (PSD), Thermal Desorption (TD) and Micrometeoroid Impact\nVaporization (MIV). The energy distribution of the IS-released neutrals peaks\nat a few eVs and extends up to hundreds of eVs. Since all other release\nprocesses produce particles of lower energies, the presence of neutral atoms in\nthe energy range above 10 eV and below a few keVs (Sputtered High-Energy Atoms\n- SHEA) identifies the IS process. SHEA easily escape from the NEO, due to\nNEO's extremely weak gravity.

The investigation of the active release processes, as a function\nof the external conditions and the NEO surface properties, is crucial for\nobtaining a clear view of the body's present loss rate as well as for getting\nclues on its evolution, which depends significantly on space weather.

To solve\nthe equations governing the dynamics of electromagnetic fields the method of\neigen-mode separation is applied previously developed with reference to\ninhomogeneous systems subject to arbitrary external static potential. We prove\ntheoretically that it is the gradient mechanism of wave-surface scattering\nwhich is the highly responsible for non-dissipative loss in the resonator. The\ninfluence of side-boundary inhomogeneities on the resonator spectrum is shown\nto be described in terms of effective renormalization of mode wave numbers\njointly with azimuth indices in the characteristic equation. To study\nexperimentally the effect of inhomogeneities on the resonator spectrum, the\nmethod of modeling in the millimeter wave range is applied. As a model object\nwe use dielectric disc resonator (DDR) fitted with external inhomogeneities\nrandomly arranged at its side boundary. Experimental results show good\nagreement with theoretical predictions as regards the predominance of the\ngradient scattering mechanism. It is shown theoretically and confirmed in the\nexperiment that TM oscillations in the DDR are less affected by surface\ninhomogeneities than TE oscillations with the same azimuth indices. The DDR\nmodel chosen for our study as well as characteristic equations obtained\nthereupon enable one to calculate both the eigen-frequencies and the Q-factors\nof resonance spectral lines to fairly good accuracy. The results of\ncalculations agree well with obtained experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2008 15:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-28"}

According to\nband structure calculations, its Fermi surface can be regarded as a network of\ncompensated orbits. The SdH spectra exhibit many Fourier components typical of\nsuch a network, most of them being forbidden in the framework of the\nsemiclassical model. Their amplitude remains large in all the pressure range\nstudied which likely rules out chemical potential oscillation as a dominant\ncontribution to their origin, in agreement with recent calculations relevant to\ncompensated Fermi liquids. In addition to a strong decrease of the magnetic\nbreakdown field and effective masses, the latter being likely due to a\nreduction of the strength of electron correlations, a sizeable increase of the\nscattering rate is observed as the applied pressure increases. This latter\npoint, which is at variance with data of most charge transfer salts is\ndiscussed in connection with pressure-induced features of the temperature\ndependence of the zero-field interlayer resistance\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2008 15:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Such a sequence is called zero-sum free, if no subsequence has sum\nzero. It is known that the maximal length of such a zero-sum free sequence is\n2n-2, and Gao and Geroldinger conjectured that every zero-sum free sequence of\nthis length contains an element with multiplicity at least n-2. By recent\nresults of Gao, Geroldinger and Grynkiewicz, it essentially suffices to verify\nthe conjecture for n prime. Now fix a sequence (a_i) of length 2n-2 with\nmaximal multiplicity of elements at most n-3. There are different approeaches\nto show that (a_i) contains a zero-sum; some work well when (a_i) does contain\nelements with high multiplicity, others work well when all multiplicities are\nsmall. The aim of this article is to initiate a systematic approach to property\nB via the highest occurring multiplicities. Our main results are the following:\ndenote by m_1 >= m_2 the two maximal multiplicities of (a_i), and suppose that\nn is sufficiently big and prime. Then (a_i) contains a zero-sum in any of the\nfollowing cases: when m_2 >= 2/3n, when m_1 > (1-c)n, and when m_2 < cn, for\nsome constant c > 0 not depending on anything.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2008 15:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-26"}
