We find instead that when one of the two orbital flavors is immobile,\nas in the Falicov-Kimball model, trapped orbital polarons coexist with free\nhole propagation emerging from the effective three-site hopping in the regime\nof large on-site Coulomb interaction U. The spectral functions are found\nanalytically in this case within the retraceable path approximation in one and\ntwo dimensions. On the contrary, when both of the orbitals are active, as in\nthe model for $t_{2g}$ electrons in two dimensions, we find propagating\npolarons with incoherent scattering dressing the moving hole and renormalizing\nthe quasiparticle dispersion. Here, the spectral functions, calculated using\nthe self-consistent Born approximation, are anisotropic and depend on the\norbital flavor. Unbiased conclusions concerning the spectral properties are\nestablished by comparing the above results for the orbital t-J models with\nthose obtained using the variational cluster approximation or exact\ndiagonalization for the corresponding Hubbard models.

The effect of change in density during the\nsolid-liquid transition as well as in the solid and the liquid phase itself\nhave been studied through two sets of simulations one at fixed density(NVE)and\nanother at variable density(NPT). A size dependent diffusivity maximum is seen\nin both solid and liquid phases at most densities except at low liquid\ndensities. Two distinct regimes may be identified : linear and anomalous\nregimes. It is seen that the effect of solid to liquid transition is to shift\nthe diffusivity maximum to smaller sizes of the solutes and decrease the height\nof the maximum. This is attributed to the predominant influence of disorder and\nrelatively weaker influence of density. The latter shifts the diffusivity\nmaximum towards larger solute size while the former does exactly the opposite.\nInterestingly, we find that lower densities lead to weaker diffusivity maximum.\nWe report for the first time for systems with large solute-solvent interaction\nstrength, $\\epsilon_{uv}$, multiple diffusivity maximum is seen as a function\nof the solute size. The origin of this is not clear. A remarkable difference in\nthe ballistic-diffusive transition is seen between solutes from the linear\nregime and anomalous regime. It is found that this transition is sharp for\nsolutes from anomalous regime. This provides interesting insight into motion of\nanomalous regime solutes. Apart from these, we report several properties which\nare different for the linear and anomalous regime solutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2008 07:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-25"}

An universal behavior\nobserved is that self diffusivity exhibits a maximum as a function of the size\nof the diffusant when the diffusant is confined to a medium, as a result of\nwhat is known as the Levitation Effect. Such a maximum in self diffusivity has\nbeen seen in widely differing medium : microporous solids, dense liquids and\nclose-packed solids, ions in polar solvents, etc. The effect arises because the\nforces exerted on the diffusant by the medium in which it is confined is a\nminimum for the size of the diffusant for which self diffusivity is a maximum.\nWe report here simulations on a diatomic species confined to the cages of\nzeolite Y. Several different simulations in which the two atoms of the model\ndiatomic species interact with equal strength(example, $O_2$, the symmetric\ncase) and with unequal interaction strengths (example, $CO$, asymmetric case)\nare modeled here.

For weakly asymmetric case, a weak maximum is seen as a function of the bond\nlength of the diatomic species.

It is shown that the concept of\nquantum entanglement between gauge fields in two complementary regions of space\ncan only be introduced if the Hilbert space of physical states is extended in a\ncertain way. In the extended Hilbert space, the entanglement entropy can be\npartially interpreted as the classical Shannon entropy of the flux of the gauge\nfields through the boundary between the two regions. Such an extension leads to\na reduction procedure which can be easily implemented in lattice simulations by\nconstructing lattices with special topology. This enables us to measure the\nentanglement entropy in lattice Monte-Carlo simulations. On the simplest\nexample of Z2 lattice gauge theory in (2 + 1) dimensions we demonstrate the\nrelation between entanglement entropy and the classical entropy of the field\nflux. For SU(2) lattice gauge theory in four dimensions, we find a signature of\nnon-analytic dependence of the entanglement entropy on the size of the region.\nWe also comment on the holographic interpretation of the entanglement entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2008 09:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

J033241.88-274853.9 is found to be a blue, young (~320Myr)\nstellar disk embedded in a very gas-rich (fgas=73-82% with\nlog(Mstellar/Mo)=9.45) and turbulent phase that is found to be rotating on\nlarge spatial scales. We identified two unusual properties of\nJ033241.88-274853.9. (1) The spatial distributions of the ionized gaseous and\nyoung stars show a strong decoupling; while almost no stars can be detected in\nthe southern part down to the very deep detection limit of ACS/UDF images,\nsignificant emission from the [OII] ionized gas is detected. (2) We detect an\nexcess of velocity dispersion in the southern part of J033241.88-274853.9 in\ncomparison to expectations from a rotating disk model. We considered two disk\nformation scenarios, depending on the gaseous phase geometry. In the first one,\nwe examined whether J033241.88-274853.9 could be a young rotating disk that has\nbeen recently collapsed from a pre-existing, very gas-rich rotating disk. This\nscenario requires two (unknown) additional assumptions to explain the\ndecoupling between the distribution of stars and gas and the excess of velocity\ndispersion in the same region. In a second scenario, we examine whether\nJ033241.88-274853.9 could be a merger remnant of two gas-rich disks. In this\ncase, the asymmetry observed between the gas and star distributions, as well as\nthe excess of velocity dispersion, find a common explanation. Shocks produced\nduring the merger in this region can be ionized easily and heat the gas while\npreventing star formation. This makes this scenario more satisfactory than the\ncollapse of a pre-existing, gas-rich rotating disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2008 15:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The Earth's inner core is weakly coupled\nto the rest part of the Earth by mainly gravitational forces. If there were a\nviolation of the universality of free-fall, because of their different chemical\ncompositions and/or of different mass fractions of binding energies, the inner\ncore and the rest part of the Earth would fall at different rates towards the\nSun and other sources of gravitational fields. The differential acceleration\ncould be observed as surface-gravity effects. By assuming a simple Earth model,\nwe discuss the expected surface-gravity effects of violations of the\nuniversality and experiments to search for such effects by using\nsuperconducting gravimeters. It is shown that the universality can be tested to\na level of 10$^{-9}$ using currently operating superconducting gravimeters.\nSome improvements can be expected from combinations of global measurements and\napplications of advanced data analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2008 07:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
