The models where initial masses are\nderived from the luminosity and colour of unresolved multiple systems show that\neven under extreme circumstances (100% binaries or higher order multiples) the\ndifference between the power-law index of the mass function of all stars and\nthe observed mass function is small (~0.1).

The aim of these observations was to study the disk-outflow\nrelation in this 1Myr old low-mass young stellar object. The IRAM PdBI array\nwas used to observe 12CO(2-1) at 1.3mm in two configurations, resulting in\nspectral line maps with 1.5 arcsec resolution.

We use existing data and our understanding of the physical behavior\nof the sources of foreground emission to generate sky templates, and start to\nassess how well primordial gravitational wave signals can be separated from\nforeground contaminants for a CMBPol mission. At the estimated foreground\nminimum of ~100 GHz, the polarized foregrounds are expected to be lower than a\nprimordial polarization signal with tensor-to-scalar ratio r=0.01, in a small\npatch (~1%) of the sky known to have low Galactic emission.

The radiation can thus be accurately\nregarded as an ideal fluid, i.e., radiative diffusion can be neglected along\nwith other forms of dissipation. This viewpoint is applied here to an analysis\nof simple waves in an ideal radiating fluid. It is shown that much of the\nhydrodynamic analysis carries over by simply replacing the material sound\nspeed, pressure and index with the values appropriate for a radiating fluid. A\ncomplete analysis is performed for a centered rarefaction wave, and expressions\nare provided for the Riemann invariants and characteristic curves of the\none-dimensional system of equations. The analytical solution is checked for\nconsistency against a finite difference numerical integration, and the validity\nof neglecting the diffusion operator is demonstrated. An interesting physical\nresult is that for a material component with a large number of internal degrees\nof freedom and an internal energy greater than that of the radiation, the sound\nspeed increases as the fluid is rarefied. These solutions are an excellent test\nfor radiation hydrodynamic codes operating in the dynamic diffusion regime. The\ngeneral approach may be useful in the development of Godunov numerical schemes\nfor radiation hydrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2008 18:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We use a semi-analytical galaxy catalogue constructed from the\nMillennium Simulation to study redshift asymmetries in spiral-dominated groups\nin the Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology. We show that discordant\nredshifts in small galaxy groups arise when these groups are gravitationally\nunbound and the dominant galaxy of the group is misidentified. The redshift\nexcess is especially significant when the apparently brightest galaxy can be\nidentified as a spiral, in full agreement with observations. On the other hand,\nthe groups that are gravitationally bound do not show a significant redshift\nasymmetry. When the dominant members of groups in mock catalogues are\nidentified by using the absolute B-band magnitudes, our results show a small\nblueshift excess. This result is due to the magnitude limited observations that\nmiss the faint background galaxies in groups. When the group centre is not\ncorrectly identified it may cause the major part of the observed redshift\nexcess. If the group is also gravitationally unbound, the level of the redshift\nexcess becomes as high as in observations. There is no need to introduce any\n\"anomalous\" redshift mechanism to explain the observed redshift excess.\nFurther, as the Friends-of-Friends percolation algorithm picks out the\nexpanding parts of groups, in addition to the gravitationally bound group\ncores, group catalogues constructed in this way cannot be used as if the groups\nare purely bound systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2008 21:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 14:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We also recompute stellar ages from the Padova\nstellar evolution models used in GCS I-II, using the new values of M_V, and\ncompare them with ages from the Yale-Yonsei and Victoria-Regina models.\nFinally, we compare the observed age-velocity relation in W with three\nsimulated disk heating scenarios to show the potential of the data.

Further improvement must await consolidation\nof the T_eff scale from angular diameters and fluxes, and the Gaia\ntrigonometric parallaxes.

Firstly, the analytic $C_l^{TT}$ and $C_l^{TE}$ are given; especially the\nlatter can be useful to extract signal of RGWs from the observed data in the\nzero multipole method. Secondly, a fitting formula of the decaying factor on\nsmall scales is given, coming from the visibility function around the photon\ndecoupling. Thirdly, the impacts by the neutrino free-streaming (NFS) is\nexamined, a process that occurred in the early universe and leaves observable\nimprints on CMB via RGWs.\n  It is found that the analytic $C_l^{TT}$ and $C_l^{TE}$ have profiles\nagreeing with the numeric ones, except that $C^{TT}_l$ in a range $l \\le 10$\nand the $1^{st}$ trough of $C_l^{TE}$ around $l \\sim 75$ have some deviations.\nWith the new damping factor, the analytic $C^{EE}_l$ and $C^{BB}_l$ match with\nthe numeric ones with the maximum errors only $\\sim 3%$ up to the first three\npeaks for $l\\le 600$, improving the previous studies substantially. The\ncorrespondence of the positions of peaks of $C^{XX}_l$ and those of RGWs are\nalso demonstrated explicitly.

Detailed analyses show that the zero multipoles\n$l_0$, where $C_l^{TE}$ crosses 0, are shifted to larger values by NFS.

Thrombin is a pro-coagulant serine\nprotease, which causes the local loss of endothelial barrier integrity thereby\nenabling the rapid extravasation of plasma proteins and the local formation of\nfibrin-containing clots. Available information suggests that thrombin induces\nendothelial permeability by promoting actomyosin contractility through the\nRho/ROCK signaling pathway. Here we took advantage of pharmacological\ninhibitors, knockdown approaches, and the emerging knowledge on how\npermeability factors affect endothelial junctions to investigate in detail the\nmechanism underlying thrombin-induced endothelial permeability. We show that\nthrombin signals through PAR-1 and its coupled G proteins G(12/13) and G(11/q)\nto induce RhoA activation and intracellular calcium elevation, and that these\nevents are interrelated. In turn, this leads to the stimulation of ROCK, which\ncauses actin stress-fiber formation. However, this alone is not sufficient to\naccount for thrombin-induced permeability. Instead, we found that protein\nkinase C-related kinase, a Rho-dependent S/T kinase, is activated in\nendothelial cells upon thrombin stimulation and that its expression is required\nfor endothelial permeability and remodeling of cell-extracellular matrix and\ncell-cell adhesions. Our results demonstrate that the signal initiated by\nthrombin bifurcates at the level of RhoA to promote changes in the cytoskeletal\narchitecture through ROCK and the remodeling of focal adhesion components\nthrough PRK. Ultimately, both pathways converge to cause cell-cell junction\ndisruption and provoke vascular leakage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2008 09:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\npaper is organized in two parts. The first one analyzes the dependence of the\nM/L ratios and of the k-corrections in different bands on model parameters\n(IMF, metallicity, star formation history, age), assuming some among the most\npopular spectrophotometric codes usually adopted to study the evolutionary\nstatus of galaxies [...]. The second part of our work is dedicated to quantify\nthe reliability and systematics affecting the mass and luminosity estimates\nobtained by means of the best fitting technique applied to the photometric SEDs\nof early-type galaxies at $1<z<2$. To this end, we apply the best fitting\ntechnique to some mock catalogs built on the basis of a wide set of models of\nearly-type galaxies. We then compare the luminosity and the stellar mass\nestimated from the SED fitting with the true known input values. The goodness\nof the mass estimate is found to be dependent on the mass estimator adopted to\nderive it, but masses cannot anyhow be retrieved better than within a factor\n2-3, depending on the quality of the available photometric data and/or on the\ndistance of the galaxies since more distant galaxies are fainter on average and\nthus affected by larger photometric errors. Finally, we present a new empirical\nmass estimator based on the K band apparent magnitude and on the observed (V-K)\ncolour. We show that the reliability of the stellar mass content derived with\nthis new estimator for early-type galaxies and its stability are even higher\nthan those achievable with the best classic estimators, with the not negligible\nadvantage that it does not need any multi-wavelength data fitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2008 10:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The two ways of counting the 35 day cycles\nare generally in synchronization. This synchronization did apparently break\ndown temporarily during the long Anomalous Low (AL3) which Her X-1 experienced\nin 1999/2000, in the sense that there must have been one extra Turn-On cycle.\nOur working hypothesis is that there are two clocks in the system, both with a\nperiod of about ~35 days: precession of the accretion disk (the less stable\n\"Turn-On clock\") and free precession of the neutron star (the more stable\n\"Pulse profile clock\"). We suggest that free precession of the neutron star is\nthe master clock, and that the precession of the accretion disk is basically\nsynchronized to that of the neutron star through a feed-back mechanism in the\nbinary system. However, the Turn-On clock can slip against its master when the\naccretion disk has a very low inclination, as is observed to be the case during\nAL3. We take the apparent correlation between the histories of the Turn-Ons, of\nthe Anomalous Lows and of the pulse period evolution, with a 5 yr\nquasi-periodicity, as evidence for strong physical interaction and feed-back\nbetween the major components in the system. We speculate that the 5 yr (10 yr)\nperiod is either due to a corresponding activity cycle of HZ Her or a natural\nringing period of the physical system of coupled components.

We\nfirst briefly summarise the main results of the full theoretical description we\nhave given elsewhere, presenting them in a more physical way, aimed to an\nunderstanding without the requirement of extended knowledge of dynamical\nsystems or of orbital structure. We introduce in this manner the notion of\nmanifolds, which can be thought of as tubes guiding the orbits. The dynamics of\nthese manifolds can govern the properties of spirals and of inner and outer\nrings in barred galaxies. We find that the bar strength affects how unstable\nthe L1 and L2 Lagrangian points are, the motion within the 5A5A5Amanifold tubes\nand the time necessary for particles in a manifold to make a complete turn\naround the galactic centre. We also show that the strength of the bar, or, to\nbe more precise, of the non-axisymmetric forcing at and somewhat beyond the\ncorotation region, determines the resulting morphology. Thus, less strong bars\ngive rise to R1 rings or pseudorings, while stronger bars drive R2, R1R2 and\nspiral morphologies. We examine the morphology as a function of the main\nparameters of the bar and present descriptive two dimensional plots to that\navail. We also derive how the manifold morphologies and properties are modified\nif the L1 and L2 Lagrangian points become stable. Finally, we discuss how\ndissipation affects the manifold properties and compare the manifolds in\ngas-like and in stellar cases.

Depending on the parameters of NS and the wind,\nthe matter can penetrate the inner NS magnetosphere. At some distance from the\nNS a very turbulent and magnetized transition region is formed due to the\nbalance between the magnetic pressure and the pressure inserted by accreting\nmatter. This region provides good conditions for acceleration of particles to\nrelativistic energies. The matter at the transition region can farther accrete\nonto the NS surface (the accretor phase) or is expelled from the NS vicinity\n(the propeller phase). We consider the consequences of acceleration of\nelectrons at the transition region concentrating on the situation in which at\nleast part of the matter falls onto the NS surface. This matter creates a hot\nspot on the NS surface which emits thermal radiation.

The\ncases where G is bipartite, triangle-free, well-covered, while the family of\nall local maximum stable sets is a greedoid, were analyzed in 2004, 2007, and\n2008, respectively.\n  In this paper we demonstrate that if the family of all local maximum stable\nsets of the graph satisfies the accessibility property, then it is an interval\ngreedoid. We also characterize those graphs whose families of local maximum\nstable sets are either antimatroids or matroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2008 14:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-25"}

The core is modeled as an infalling envelope onto a massive star that is\nundergoing an intense accretion phase. We assume an envelope with a density and\nvelocity structure resulting from the dynamical collapse of a singular\nlogatropic sphere. The stellar and envelope physical properties are determined\nby fitting the SED. From these physical conditions, the ammonia line emission\nis calculated and compared with subarcsecond resolution VLA data of the (4,4)\ntransition. The only free parameter in this line fitting is the ammonia\nabundance. The observed properties of the NH3(4,4) lines and their spatial\ndistribution can be well reproduced provided it is taken into account the steep\nincrease of the abundance in the hotter (> 100 K), inner regions of the core\nproduced by the sublimation of icy mantles where ammonia molecules are trapped.\nThe model predictions for the (2,2), (4,4), and (5,5) transitions are also in\nreasonably agreement with the single-dish spectra available in the literature.\nThe best fit is obtained for a model with a star of 25 Msun, a mass accretion\nrate of 0.003 Msun/yr, and a total luminosity of 200,000 Lsun.

For inhomogeneous AC fields we find strong deviations from\nreciprocity relations and show that their origin can be understood from the the\nbilliard model of a Hall junction.

In this article however we show, through an enforcement of\nthe Hamiltonian and momentum constraints to the needed order in a Taylor\nexpansion, that these apparently singular terms are not only regular at the\nboundary but can in fact be explicitly evaluated there in terms of conformally\nregular geometric data. Though we employ a rather rigidly constrained and gauge\nfixed formulation of the field equations, we discuss the extent to which we\nexpect our results to have a more 'universal' significance and, in particular,\nto be applicable, after minor modifications, to alternative formulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2008 15:25:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 15:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-01"}

We study a minimal model composed of\ncoupled itinerant electrons and local moments to illustrate how a consistent\nexplanation of the experimental measurements can be obtained in the leading\norder approximation. In this mean-field approach, the spin-density-wave (SDW)\norder and superconducting pairing of the itinerant electrons are not directly\ndriven by the Fermi surface nesting, but are mainly induced by their coupling\nto the local moments. The presence of the local moments as independent degrees\nof freedom naturally provides strong pairing strength for superconductivity and\nalso explains the normal-state linear-temperature magnetic susceptibility above\nthe SDW transition temperature. We show that this simple model is supported by\nvarious anomalous magnetic properties and isotope effect which are in\nquantitative agreement with experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2008 15:37:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2008 00:55:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2008 12:48:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2010 03:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}
