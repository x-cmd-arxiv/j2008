After a long period of little interest due to the lack of\nexperimental evidence, it has attracted strong experimental and theoretical\nattention in the last few years since Kim and Chan (Penn State, USA) reported\nevidence for nonclassical rotational inertia effects, a typical signature of\nsuperfluidity, in samples of solid 4He. Since this \"first observation\", other\nexperimental groups have observed such effects in the response to the rotation\nof samples of crystalline helium, and it has become clear that the response of\nthe solid is extremely sensitive to growth conditions, annealing processes, and\n3He impurities. A peak in the specific heat in the same range of temperatures\nhas been reported as well as anomalies in the elastic behaviour of solid 4He\nwith a strong resemblance to the phenomena revealed by torsional oscillator\nexperiments. Very recently, the observation of unusual mass transport in hcp\nsolid 4He has also been reported, suggesting superflow. From the theoretical\npoint of view, powerful simulation methods have been used to study solid 4He,\nbut the interpretation of the data is still rather difficult; dealing with the\nquestion of supersolidity means that one has to face not only the problem of\nthe coexistence of quantum coherence phenomena and crystalline order, exploring\nthe realm of spontaneous symmetry breaking and quantum field theory, but also\nthe problem of the role of disorder, i.e., how defects, such as vacancies,\nimpurities, dislocations, and grain boundaries, participate in the phase\ntransition mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2008 18:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

First, basing on the\nfact that any positive map $\\Lambda:M_{d}(\\mathbb{C})\\to M_{d}(\\mathbb{C})$ can\nbe written as the difference between two completely positive maps\n$\\Lambda=\\Lambda_{1}-\\Lambda_{2}$, we propose a possible way to generalize the\nNielsen--Kempe majorization criterion.

While the first one follows from the aforementioned\ngeneralized majorization relation and the concept of the Schur--concave\ndecreasing functions, the second is based on some functional inequalities. What\nis important is that, contrary to the Nielsen--Kempe majorization criterion and\nentropic inequalities, our criteria allow for the detection of entangled states\nwith positive partial transposition when using indecomposable positive maps. We\nalso point out that if a state with at least one maximally mixed subsystem is\ndetected by some necessary criterion based on the positive map $\\Lambda$, then\nthere exist entropic inequalities derived from $\\Lambda$ (by both procedures)\nthat also detect this state. In this sense, they are equivalent to the\nnecessary criterion $[I\\ot\\Lambda](\\varrho_{AB})\\geq 0$. Moreover, our\ninequalities provide a way of constructing multi--copy entanglement witnesses\nand therefore are promising from the experimental point of view.

One-dimensional calculations using the\nLinear Eddy Model of Kerstein (1991) elucidate three regimes of turbulent\nburning. In the simplest case, large scale turbulence folds and deforms thin\nlaminar flamelets to produce a flame brush with a total burning rate given\napproximately by the speed of turbulent fluctuations on the integral scale,\nU_L. This is the regime where the supernova explosion begins and where most of\nits pre-detonation burning occurs. As the density declines, turbulence starts\nto tear the individual flamelets, making broader structures that move faster.\nFor a brief time, these turbulent flamelets are still narrow compared to their\nspacing and the concept of a flame brush moving with an overall speed of U_L\nremains valid. However, the typical width of the individual flamelets, which is\ngiven by the condition that their turnover time equals their burning time,\ncontinues to increase as the density declines. Eventually, mixed regions almost\nas large as the integral scale itself are transiently formed. At that point, a\ntransition to detonation can occur. The conditions for such a transition are\nexplored numerically and it is estimated that the transition will occur for\ndensities near 1 x 10**7 g/cm**3, provided the turbulent speed on the integral\nscale exceeds about 15% sonic.

The Landauer formalism\napplies from the ballistic to diffusive limits and provides a clear way to\ncompare performance in different dimensions. It also provides a physical\ninterpretation of the \"transport distribution,\" a quantity that arises in the\nBoltzmann transport equation approach. Quantitative comparison of\nthermoelectric coefficients in one, two, and three dimension shows that the\nchannels may be utilized more effectively in lower-dimensions. To realize the\nadvantage of lower dimensionality, however, the packing density must be very\nhigh, so the thicknesses of the quantum wells or wires must be small. The\npotential benefits of engineering M(E) into a delta-function are also\ninvestigated. When compared to a bulk semiconductor, we find the potential for\n~50 % improvement in performance. The shape of M(E) improves as dimensionality\ndecreases, but lower dimensionality itself does not guarantee better\nperformance because it is controlled by both the shape and the magnitude of\nM(E). The benefits of engineering the shape of M(E) appear to be modest, but\napproaches to increase the magnitude of M(E) could pay large dividends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2008 20:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-15"}

Understanding the underlying mechanisms which produce\ninverted biomass pyramids provides new ecological insights, and for coral\nreefs, may help mitigate or restore damaged reefs. We present three classes of\npredator-prey models which elucidate mechanisms that generate robust inverted\nbiomass pyramids. The first class of models exploits well-mixing of predators\nand prey, the second class has a refuge (with explicit size) for the prey to\nhide, and the third class incorporates the immigration of prey. Our models\nindicate that inverted biomass pyramids occur when the prey growth rate, prey\ncarrying capacity, biomass conversion efficiency, the predator life span, or\nthe immigration rate of prey fish is sufficiently large. In the second class,\nwe discuss three hypotheses on how refuge size can impact the amount of prey\navailable to predators. By explicitly incorporating a refuge size, these can\nmore realistically model predator-prey interactions than refgue models with\nimplicit refuge size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2008 06:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-25"}

It is clear that this is\nthe result of an anomalous contraction upon heating which counteracts the\nnormal thermal expansion arising from the anharmonicity of lattice vibrations.\nThis anomalous contraction seems to be related to the alloys' magnetic\nproperties, since the effect vanishes at a temperature close to the Curie\ntemperature. However, despite many years of intensive research, a widely\naccepted microscopic theory of the Invar effect in face-centered-cubic Fe-Ni\nalloys is still lacking.

Languages based on regular expressions (RE) have been\nproposed to restrict frequent sequences to the ones that satisfy user-specified\nconstraints. Although the support of a sequence is computed as the number of\ndata-sequences satisfying a pattern with respect to the total number of\ndata-sequences in the database, once regular expressions come into play, new\napproaches to the concept of support are needed. For example, users may be\ninterested in computing the support of the RE as a whole, in addition to the\none of a particular pattern. Also, when the items are frequently updated, the\ntraditional way of counting support in sequential pattern mining may lead to\nincorrect (or, at least incomplete), conclusions. The problem gets more\ninvolved if we are interested in categorical sequential patterns. In light of\nthe above, in this paper we propose to revise the classic notion of support in\nsequential pattern mining, introducing the concept of temporal support of\nregular expressions, intuitively defined as the number of sequences satisfying\na target pattern, out of the total number of sequences that could have possibly\nmatched such pattern, where the pattern is defined as a RE over complex items\n(i.e., not only item identifiers, but also attributes and functions).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2008 15:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-25"}
