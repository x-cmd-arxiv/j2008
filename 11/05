Other than the standard model fields\npropagating in the bulk of a 5-dimensional space, one fermion field and one\nscalar field are introduced and both are standard model singlets. The zero mode\nof the new fermion is identified as the right-handed neutrino, while its first\nKK mode is the lightest KK-odd particle and the dark matter candidate. The\ncosmic ray spectra from ATIC and PPB-BETS determine the dark matter particle\nmass and hence the fifth dimension compactification scale to be 1.0-1.6 TeV.\nThe zero mode of the singlet scalar field with a mass below 1 GeV provides an\nattractive force between dark matter particles, which allows a Sommerfeld\nenhancement to boost the annihilation cross section in the Galactic halo to\nexplain the PAMELA data. The DAMA annual modulation results are explained by\ncoupling the same scalar field to the electron via a higher-dimensional\noperator. We analyze the model parameter space that can satisfy the dark matter\nrelic abundance and accommodate all the dark matter detection experiments. We\nalso consider constraints from the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background,\nwhich can be satisfied if the dark matter particle and the first KK-mode of the\nscalar field have highly degenerate masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2008 19:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 17:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-21"}

A formulation is employed in which the binary\nclassifier is constructed as a thresholded linear superposition of a set of\nweak classifiers. The weights in the superposition are optimized in a learning\nprocess that strives to minimize the training error as well as the number of\nweak classifiers used. No efficient solution to this problem is known. To bring\nit into a format that allows the application of adiabatic quantum computing\n(AQC), we first show that the bit-precision with which the weights need to be\nrepresented only grows logarithmically with the ratio of the number of training\nexamples to the number of weak classifiers. This allows to effectively\nformulate the training process as a binary optimization problem. Solving it\nwith heuristic solvers such as tabu search, we find that the resulting\nclassifier outperforms a widely used state-of-the-art method, AdaBoost, on a\nvariety of benchmark problems. Moreover, we discovered the interesting fact\nthat bit-constrained learning machines often exhibit lower generalization error\nrates. Changing the loss function that measures the training error from 0-1\nloss to least squares maps the training to quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization. This corresponds to the format required by D-Wave's\nimplementation of AQC. Simulations with heuristic solvers again yield results\nbetter than those obtained with boosting approaches. Since the resulting\nquadratic binary program is NP-hard, additional gains can be expected from\napplying the actual quantum processor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2008 20:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-05"}

The astrometric measurements enable us to compute the orbital\nparameters and result in the first dynamical mass estimate for the system. We\nobtained resolved high angular resolution, near-IR images with HST and the\nVLT/NACO adaptive optics instrument in the J, H and Ks bands. In addition we\nused NACO to achieve the first spatially resolved mid-resolution spectra in the\nH- and K-band for a precise spectral type determination. The near-IR spectrum\nof Kelu-1A reveals a distinct dip in the H-band providing evidence that Kelu-1\nA itself is a spectroscopic binary. We derive spectral types of L0.5+- 0.5 for\nKelu- 1 Aa and T7.5+-1 for Kelu-1 Ab. Kelu-1B is classified as spectral type\nL3pec +-1.5. From the relative orbit, we derive an orbital period of 38 +8 -6\nyears and a semi-major axis of 6.4+2.4 -1.3 AU. This yields the first\ndynamically determined total system mass of 177 +113 -55 Mjup for the Kelu-1AB\nsystem, with the uncertainties mainly attributed to the error of the system\ndistance measurement and the yet missing apastron passage. The derived\nproperties of Kelu-1AB allow us to test common theoretical models. The\ncomparison of our results with color-magnitude diagrams based on evolutionary\nmodels yields a slightly revised age estimate (0.3 - 0.5 Gyr) and a discrepancy\nbetween dynamically and theoretically derived masses, stressing the importance\nfor further dynamical mass determinations of brown dwarf binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2008 19:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-05"}

This is the first\nobservational campaign including gamma-ray data, after the last EGRET\nobservations, more than 8 years ago. Our study was carried out using\nsimultaneous light curves of the source flux from all the involved instruments,\nin the different energy ranges, in search for correlated variability. Then a\ntime-resolved SED was used for a detailed physical modelling of the emission\nmechanisms. The source was detected in gamma-rays only in the second week of\nour campaign. We found indication of a possible anti-correlation between the\nemission at gamma-rays and at soft and hard X-rays, supported by the complete\nset of instruments. Instead, optical data do not show short term variability.\nOnly in two EGRET observations (in 1993 and 1997) 3C 273 showed\nintra-observation variability in gamma-rays. The SED with almost simultaneous\ndata, partially covers the regions of the synchrotron emission, the big blue\nbump, and the inverse-Compton. The soft X-ray emission is consistent with\ncombined SSC and EC mechanisms, while hard X and gamma-ray emissions are\ncompatible with EC from thermal photons of the disk. The time evolution of the\nSED is well interpreted and modelled in terms of an acceleration episode of the\nelectrons population, leading to a shift in the IC peak towards higher\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2008 20:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

In their analysis, however, the\nfull structure of the initial value problem for the nonlocal dynamical\nequations was not considered. In this paper, therefore, we reexamine the\nnonlinear dynamics of light-like tachyon condensation using a combination of\nnumerical and analytical techniques. We find that for the p-adic string the\nmonotonic behaviour obtained previously relied on a special choice of initial\nconditions near the unstable maximum.

Interestingly, we find an \"island of\nstability\" in initial condition space that leads to sensible evolution at late\ntimes.

The\nexact symmetry of the Lagrangian with local quartic terms for the Dirac field\ndictated by the lattice is D_2 x U_c(1) x (time reversal), where D_2 is the\ndihedral group, and U_c(1) is a subgroup of the SU_c(2) \"chiral\" group of the\nnon-interacting Lagrangian, that represents translations in Dirac language. The\nLagrangian describing spinless particles respecting this symmetry is\nparameterized by six independent coupling constants. We show how first imposing\nthe rotational, then Lorentz, and finally chiral symmetry to the quartic terms,\nin conjunction with the Fierz transformations, eventually reduces the set of\ncouplings to just two, in the \"maximally symmetric\" local interacting theory.\nWe identify the two critical points in such a Lorentz and chirally symmetric\ntheory as describing metal-insulator transitions into the states with either\ntime-reversal or chiral symmetry being broken. In the site-localized limit of\nthe interacting Hamiltonian the low-energy theory describes the continuous\ntransitions into the insulator with either a finite Haldane's (circulating\ncurrents) or Semenoff's (staggered density) masses, both in the universality\nclass of the Gross-Neveu model. The picture of the metal-insulator transition\non a honeycomb lattice emerges at which the residue of the quasiparticle pole\nat the metallic and the mass-gap in the insulating phase both vanish\ncontinuously as the critical point is approached.

Stellar absorption lines in the optical have been extensively\nstudied and constitute an important stellar population diagnostic for galaxies\nin the local universe and up to moderate redshifts. Proceeding towards higher\nlook-back times, galaxies are younger and the ultraviolet becomes the relevant\nspectral region where the dominant stellar populations shine.

We study here if\nsuch habitable planets can form, by numerically investigating the\nplanet-formation stage which is probably the most sensitive to binarity\neffects: the mutual accretion of km-sized planetesimals. Using a\nstate-of-the-art algorithm for computing the impact velocities within a test\nplanetesimal population, we find that planetesimal growth is only possible,\nalthough marginally, in the innermost part of the HZ around 0.5AU. Beyond this\npoint, the combination of secular perturbations by the binary companion and gas\ndrag drive the mutual velocities beyond the erosion limit. Impact velocities\nmight later decrease during the gas removal phase, but this probably happens\ntoo late for preventing most km-sized objects to be removed by inward drift,\nthus preventing accretion from starting anew. A more promising hypothesis is\nthat the binary formed in a crowded cluster, where it might have been wider in\nits initial stages, when planetary formation was ongoing.

The X-ray spectrum hardens when the source\nflux becomes lower, confirming the trend of spectral variability known for many\nSeyfert 1 galaxies. The broad-band averaged spectrum and spectra in high and\nlow flux intervals are analyzed. The spectra are first fitted with a model\nconsisting of a power-law component, a reflection continuum originating in cold\nmatter, a blackbody component, two zones of ionized absorber, and several\nGaussian emission lines. The amount of reflection is rather large (R ~ 7, where\nR=1 corresponds to reflection by an infinite slab), while the equivalent width\nof the Fe-K line at 6.4 keV is modest (140 eV) for the averaged spectrum. We\nthen model the overall spectra by introducing partial covering for the\npower-law component and reflection continuum independently. The column density\nfor the former is 1x10^23 cm^-2, while it is fixed at 1x10^24 cm-2 for the\nlatter.

In high-mobility\ntwo-dimensional electron systems (2DES), the spin lifetime strongly depends on\nthe initial degree of spin polarization due to the electron-electron\ninteraction. The Hartree-Fock (HF) term of the Coulomb interaction acts like an\neffective out-of-plane magnetic field and thus reduces the spin-flip rate. By\ntime-resolved Faraday rotation (TRFR) techniques, we demonstrate that the spin\nlifetime is increased by an order of magnitude as the initial spin polarization\ndegree is raised from the low-polarization limit to several percent. We perform\ncontrol experiments to decouple the excitation density in the sample from the\nspin polarization degree and investigate the interplay of the internal HF field\nand an external perpendicular magnetic field. The lifetime of spins oriented in\nthe plane of a [001]-grown 2DES is strongly anisotropic if the Rashba and\nDresselhaus spin-orbit fields are of the same order of magnitude. This\nanisotropy, which stems from the interference of the Rashba and the Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit fields, is highly density-dependent: as the electron density is\nincreased, the kubic Dresselhaus term becomes dominant and reduces the\nanisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2008 13:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In particular, it has been predicted on the\nbasis of the Harris criterion that disorder is relevant (annealed and quenched\nmodel have different critical points and critical exponents) if the return\nprobability exponent alpha, a positive number that characterizes the model, is\nlarger than 1/2. Weak disorder has been predicted to be irrelevant (i.e.\ncoinciding critical points and exponents) if alpha < 1/2. Recent mathematical\nwork has put these predictions on firm grounds. In renormalization group terms,\nthe case alpha = 1/2 is a 'marginal case' and there is no agreement in the\nliterature as to whether one should expect disorder relevance or irrelevance at\nmarginality. The question is particularly intriguing also because the case\nalpha = 1/2 includes the classical models of two-dimensional wetting of a rough\nsubstrate, of pinning of directed polymers on a defect line in dimension (3+1)\nor (1+1) and of pinning of an heteropolymer by a point potential in\nthree-dimensional space.

The infrastructure uses multi-antenna base stations (BSs), in which the\nnumber of BSs and the number of antennas at each BS can scale at arbitrary\nrates relative to $n$. Under the model, capacity scaling laws are analyzed for\nboth dense and extended networks. Two BS-based routing schemes are first\nintroduced in this study: an infrastructure-supported single-hop (ISH) routing\nprotocol with multiple-access uplink and broadcast downlink and an\ninfrastructure-supported multi-hop (IMH) routing protocol. Then, their\nachievable throughput scalings are analyzed. These schemes are compared against\ntwo conventional schemes without BSs: the multi-hop (MH) transmission and\nhierarchical cooperation (HC) schemes. It is shown that a linear throughput\nscaling is achieved in dense networks, as in the case without help of BSs. In\ncontrast, the proposed BS-based routing schemes can, under realistic network\nconditions, improve the throughput scaling significantly in extended networks.\nThe gain comes from the following advantages of these BS-based protocols.\nFirst, more nodes can transmit simultaneously in the proposed scheme than in\nthe MH scheme if the number of BSs and the number of antennas are large enough.\nSecond, by improving the long-distance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nreceived signal power can be larger than that of the HC, enabling a better\nthroughput scaling under extended networks. Furthermore, by deriving the\ncorresponding information-theoretic cut-set upper bounds, it is shown under\nextended networks that a combination of four schemes IMH, ISH, MH, and HC is\norder-optimal in all operating regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2008 13:56:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2010 04:36:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 02:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Their\nmorphology is similar to the cavities observed in cluster cores, but they have\nradii of 240 kpc and 160 kpc and have a total enthalpy of 2x10^62 erg. If they\nare fossil radio bubbles, their buoyancy timescales imply a total mechanical\nheating power of 5x10^46 erg/s, the largest such bubble heating power known.\nMore likely, they result from the accumulation of many past bubbles.\nEnergetically this is more feasible, as the enthalpy of these regions could\ncombat X-ray cooling in this cluster to 500 kpc radius for around 2 Gyr. The\ncore of the cluster also contains five to seven ~4 kpc radius surface\nbrightness depressions that are not associated with the observed radio\nemission. If they are bubbles generated by the nucleus, they are too small to\nbalance cooling in the core by an order of magnitude. However if the radio axis\nis close to the line of sight, projection effects may mask more normal bubbles.\nUsing RGS spectra we detect a FeXVII line. Spectral fitting reveals\ntemperatures down to ~0.7 keV; the cluster therefore shows a range in X-ray\ntemperature of at least a factor of 15. The quantity of low temperature gas is\nconsistent with a mass deposition rate of 65 Msun/yr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2008 15:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nAuger hybrid detector combines fluorescence observations of the longitudinal\nprofiles of extended air showers, initiated by these extremely energetic\nparticles, with measures of the shower secondaries at the ground level by its\nlarge array of Cherenkov water tanks. The complementariness of the two\ntechniques provides important cross-checks at the energies unreachable with\naccelerator experiments. The Pierre Auger experiment has observed a strong\nsteepening of the cosmic ray flux above 40 EeV. A significant anisotropy in the\narrival directions of cosmic rays has been established for events above $\\simeq\n60$ EeV. These events correlate over angular scales of less than 6$^\\circ$ with\nthe directions towards nearby ($D < 100$ Mpc) active galactic nuclei. Both\nobservations are consistent with the standard scenarios of the UHECR production\nin the extragalactic astrophysical acceleration sites. The derived stringent\nupper limits on the photon and neutrino contents in the UHECR are additional\nimportant arguments in support of these scenarios. The measurements of the\nvariation of the depth of shower maximum with energy, interpreted with the\ncurrent hadronic interaction models, favour the mixed cosmic ray composition at\nenergies above 0.4 EeV. We describe the plans and prospects for the future,\nthat will further help to solve the 50 years old UHECR puzzle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2008 15:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

In\nthe present paper we show how one can develop a consistent framework for\nstudying the non-equilibrium Kondo model within a scaling picture of\ninfinitesimal unitary transformations (flow equations). Decoherence effects\nappear naturally in third order of the beta-function and dominate the\nHamiltonian flow for sufficiently large voltage bias.
