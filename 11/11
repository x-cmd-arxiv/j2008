Both a simple Gaussian curve and\nan evolved Schechter function fit the bright half of the GCLF equally well,\nthough the Coma GCLF is broader and has a higher ``cutoff mass'' (M_c ~ 3 x\n10^6 M_Sun) than in any of the Virgo giants.

The summed spectral energy\ndistribution of all the ten knots in 3C 273 jet can be well fitted by two\ncomponents, low-energy (radio to optical) component dominated by the\nsynchrotron radiation and high-energy component (UV, X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray)\ndominated by the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background.\nThis gives a consistent spectral index of $\\alpha=0.88$ ($S_\\nu \\propto\n\\nu^{-\\alpha}$) and a characteristic Doppler factor of 7.4.

The spectroscopic sample includes 60 of the\n100 sources in these combined catalogs having fv(24um) > 10 mJy. New spectra\nfrom the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph are presented for 25 FLS sources and for\n11 Bootes AGN; these are combined with 24 Bootes starburst galaxies previously\npublished to determine the distribution of mid-infrared spectral\ncharacteristics for the total 10 mJy sample. Sources have 0.01 < z < 2.4 and\n41.8 < log vLv(15um) < 46.2 (ergs/s). Average spectra are determined as a\nfunction of luminosity; lower luminosity sources (log vLv(15um) < 44.0) are\ndominated by PAH features and higher luminosity sources (log vLv(15um) > 44.0)\nare dominated by silicate absorption or emission. We find that a rest frame\nequivalent width of 0.4um for the 6.2um PAH emission feature provides a well\ndefined division between lower luminosity, \"pure\" starbursts and higher\nluminosity AGN or composite sources. Using the average spectra, fluxes fv(24um)\nwhich would be observed with the Spitzer MIPS are predicted as a function of\nredshift for sources with luminosities that correspond to the average spectra.\nAGN identical to those in this 10 mJy sample could be seen to z = 3 with\nfv(24um) > 1 mJy, but starbursts fall to fv(24um) < 1 mJy by z ~ 0.5.

Optical and near-IR spectroscopic studies\nshow no evidence for similarly high velocity gas components in forbidden lines\nat shorter wavelengths.

In the phase space, the debris assemble in a\nhierarchy which is truncated by the primordial temperature of dark matter.\nUnderstanding this phase structure can be of significant importance for the\ninterpretation of many astrophysical observations and in particular dark matter\ndetection experiments. With this purpose in mind, we develop a general\ntheoretical framework to describe the hierarchical structure of the phase space\nof cold dark matter haloes.

The latter is dominated by the regions beyond 20%\nof the virial radius, and is largest for the recently formed haloes with the\nleast degree of phase mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2008 21:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

Exactly speaking, due to the net energy flow, the\nblack hole evaporation is a nonequilibrium process. To study details of\nevaporation process, nonequilibrium effects of the net energy flow should be\ntaken into account. In this article we simplify the situation so that the\nHawking radiation consists of non-self-interacting massless matter fields and\nalso the energy accretion onto the black hole consists of the same fields. Then\nwe find that the nonequilibrium nature of black hole evaporation is described\nby a nonequilibrium state of that field, and we formulate nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics of non-self-interacting massless fields. By applying it to black\nhole evaporation, followings are shown: (1) Nonequilibrium effects of the\nenergy flow tends to accelerate the black hole evaporation, and, consequently,\na specific nonequilibrium phenomenon of semi-classical black hole evaporation\nis suggested. Furthermore a suggestion about the end state of quantum size\nblack hole evaporation is proposed in the context of information loss paradox.\n(2) Negative heat capacity of black hole is the physical essence of the\ngeneralized second law of black hole thermodynamics, and self-entropy\nproduction inside the matter around black hole is not necessary to ensure the\ngeneralized second law. Furthermore a lower bound for total entropy at the end\nof black hole evaporation is given.

In\ncontrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight\ngeneralization bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms by\nexploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory,\nexisting stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the\nsamples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning\napplications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received\nby the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence.\n  This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a\nstationary phi-mixing or beta-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in\nthe study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between\nobservations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based\ngeneralization bounds for stationary phi-mixing and beta-mixing sequences.\nThese bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply\nto all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of\nstability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios.\n  We also illustrate the application of our phi-mixing generalization bounds to\ngeneral classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression,\nKernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel\nregularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms.\nThese novel bounds can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for the\nuse of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2008 05:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-12"}

It has been suggested\nthat the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) leads to rapid field growth.\nAlthough MRI studies exist for accretion discs, the application of their\nresults to core collapse supernovae is inhibited as the physics of supernova\ncores is substantially different from that of accretion discs. We address the\nproblem of growth and saturation of the MRI by means of semi-global\nsimulations, which combine elements of global and local simulations by taking\nthe presence of global background gradients into account and using a local\ncomputational grid. We analyze the dispersion relation of the MRI to identify\ndifferent regimes of the instability. This analysis is complemented by\nsimulations, where we consider a local computational box rotating at\nsub-Keplerian velocity, and where we allow for a radial entropy gradient. We\nidentify six regimes of the MRI depending on the ratio of the entropy and\nangular velocity gradient. Our numerical models confirm the instability\ncriteria and growth rates for all relevant regimes. The MRI grows exponentially\nwithin milliseconds the flow and magnetic field geometries being dominated by\nchannel flows. The MRI growth ceases once the channels are disrupted by\nresistive instabilities (due to finite numerical conductivity), and MHD\nturbulence sets in. From an analysis of the growth rates of the resistive\ninstabilities, we deduce scaling laws for the termination amplitude of the MRI\nwhich agree well with our numerical models.

A large infrared bow\nshock has been discovered using Spitzer/MIPS observations. Although it appears\nas a significant contributor to the measured IR excess, the possibility exists\nthat a circumstellar IR excess is present around the stars of the system. -\nAims: The objective of the present VISIR and NACO observations is to identify\nwhether one of the stars of the delta Vel system presents a circumstellar\nphotometric excess in the thermal IR domain and to quantify it. - Methods: We\nobserved delta Vel using the imaging modes of the ESO/VLT instruments VISIR (in\nBURST mode) and NACO to resolve the A-B system (0.6\" separation) and obtain the\nphotometry of each star. We also obtained one NACO photometry epoch precisely\nat the primary (annular) eclipse of delta Vel Aa by Ab. - Results: Our\nphotometric measurements with NACO (2.17 mic), complemented by the existing\nvisible photometry allowed us to reconstruct the spectral energy distribution\nof the three stars. We then compared the VISIR photometry (8.6-12.8 mic) to the\nexpected photospheric emission from the three stars at the corresponding\nwavelengths. - Conclusions: We can exclude the presence of a circumstellar\nthermal infrared excess around delta Vel A or B down to a few percent level.\nThis supports the conclusions of Gaspar et al. (2008) that the IR excess of\ndelta Vel has an interstellar origin, although a cold circumstellar disk could\nstill be present. In addition, we derive the spectral types of the three stars\nAa, Ab, and B (respectively A2IV, A4V and F8V), and we estimate the age of the\nsystem around 400-500 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2008 10:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
