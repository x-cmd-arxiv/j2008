We construct a model of escape that\nincludes realistic heating and cooling, ionization balance, tidal gravity, and\npressure confinement by the host star wind. We show that mass loss takes the\nform of a hydrodynamic (\"Parker\") wind, emitted from the planet's dayside\nduring lulls in the stellar wind. When dayside winds are suppressed by the\nconfining action of the stellar wind, nightside winds might pick up if there is\nsufficient horizontal transport of heat. A hot Jupiter loses mass at maximum\nrates of ~2 x 10^12 g/s during its host star's pre-main-sequence phase and ~2\nx10^10 g/s during the star's main sequence lifetime, for total maximum losses\nof ~0.06% and ~0.6% of the planet's mass, respectively. For UV fluxes F_UV <\n10^4 erg/cm^2/s, the mass loss rate is approximately energy-limited and is\nproportional to F_UV^0.9. For larger UV fluxes, such as those typical of T\nTauri stars, radiative losses and plasma recombination force the mass loss rate\nto increase more slowly as F_UV^0.6. Dayside winds are quenched during the T\nTauri phase because of confinement by overwhelming stellar wind pressure. We\nconclude that while UV radiation can indeed drive winds from hot Jupiters, such\nwinds cannot significantly alter planetary masses during any evolutionary\nstage. They can, however, produce observable signatures.

With the recent availability of large-scale\nmulti-epoch photometric datasets we were able to study eclipsing binary stars\nen masse. In this thesis, we analyzed 185,445 light curves from ten TrES\nfields, and 218,699 light curves from the OGLE II bulge fields. In order to\nmanage such large quantities of data, we developed a pipeline with which we\nsystematically identified eclipsing binaries, solved for their geometric\norientations, and then found their components' absolute properties. Following\nthis analysis we assembled catalogs of eclipsing binaries with their models,\ncomputed statistical distributions of their properties, and located rare cases\nfor further follow-up, including T-Cyg1-03378, which has unusual eclipse timing\nvariations. Of particular importance are low-mass eclipsing binaries, which are\nrare yet critical for resolving the ongoing mass-radius discrepancy between\ntheoretical models and observations. To this end, we have discovered over a\ndozen new low-mass eclipsing binary candidates and spectroscopically confirmed\nthe masses of five of them. One of these confirmed candidates, T-Lyr1-17236, is\nespecially interesting because of its long orbital period.

The analysis is carried out by using two-component (n-gamma,gamma_1)\nspherical self-consistent galaxy models, in which one density distribution\nfollows a generalized gamma profile with external logarithmic slope n, and the\nother a standard gamma_1 profile (with external slope 4). The necessary and\nsufficient conditions for phase-space consistency are determined analytically,\nalso in presence of a dominant massive central black hole, and the analytical\nphase-space distribution function of (n-gamma,1) models, and of n-gamma models\nwith a central black hole, is derived for gamma=0,1,2.

In these cases the asymptotic expansions of the free\nenergies given by the logarithm of the partition functions lead to the\ndispersionless (i.e. continuous) limits for the Toda and Pfaff lattice\nhierarchies. There is a universality between all three ensembles of random\nmatrices, one consequence of which is that the leading orders of the free\nenergy for large matrices agree. In this paper, this universality, in the case\nof Gaussian ensembles, is explicitly demonstrated by computing the leading\norders of the free energies in the expansions. We also show that the free\nenergy as the solution of the dispersionless Toda lattice hierarchy gives a\nsolution of the dispersionless Pfaff lattice hierarchy, which implies that this\nuniversality holds in general for the leading orders of the unitary,\northogonal, and symplectic ensembles.\n  We also find an explicit formula for the two point function $F_{nm}$ which\nrepresents the number of connected ribbon graphs with two vertices of degrees n\nand m on a sphere. The derivation is based on the Faber polynomials defined on\nthe spectral curve of the dispersionless Toda lattice hierarchy, and\n$\\frac{1}{nm} F_{nm}$ are the Grunsky coefficients of the Faber polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 17:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Interest in this\nproblem stems from its relationship to the non-linear stability of the black\nhole spacetimes themselves as solutions to the Einstein equations, one of the\ncentral open problems of general relativity. After an introductory discussion\nof the Schwarzschild geometry and the black hole concept, the classical theorem\nof Kay and Wald on the boundedness of scalar waves on the exterior region of\nSchwarzschild is reviewed. The original proof is presented, followed by a new\nmore robust proof of a stronger boundedness statement. The problem of decay of\nscalar waves on Schwarzschild is then addressed, and a theorem proving\nquantitative decay is stated and its proof sketched. This decay statement is\ncarefully contrasted with the type of statements derived heuristically in the\nphysics literature for the asymptotic tails of individual spherical harmonics.\nFollowing this, our recent proof of the boundedness of solutions to the wave\nequation on axisymmetric stationary backgrounds (including slowly-rotating Kerr\nand Kerr-Newman) is reviewed and a new decay result for slowly-rotating Kerr\nspacetimes is stated and proved. This last result was announced at the summer\nschool and appears in print here for the first time. A discussion of the\nanalogue of these problems for spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant\nfollows. Finally, a general framework is given for capturing the red-shift\neffect for non-extremal black holes. This unifies and extends some of the\nanalysis of the previous sections.

There are several versions of personal\nincome distribution (PID) provided by the US Census Bureau (US CB) for this\nperiod with various levels of resolution. Effectively, these PIDs result in\ndifferent Gini coefficients due to the differences between discrete and\ncontinuous representations. When all persons of 15 years of age and over are\nincluded in the PIDs, Gini coefficient drops from 0.64 in 1947 to 0.54 in 1990.\nThis effect is observed due to a significant decrease in the portion of people\nwithout income. For the PIDs not including persons without income, Gini\ncoefficient is varying around 0.51 between 1960 and 2005 with standard\ndeviation of 0.004, i.e. is in fact constant. This Gini coefficient is\npractically independent on the portion of population included in the PIDs\naccording to any revision of income definitions. The driving force of the model\ndescribing the evolution of individual incomes (microeconomic level) and their\naggregate value (macroeconomic level) is the change in nominal GDP per capita.\nThe model accurately predicts the evolution of Gini coefficient for the PIDs\nfor people with income. The model gives practically unchanged (normalized) PIDs\nand Gini coefficient between 1947 and 2005. The empirical Gini curves converge\nto the predicted one when the number of people without income decreases.\nAsymptotically, the empirical curves should collapse to the theoretical one\nwhen all the working age population obtains an appropriate definition of\nincome. Therefore the model Gini coefficient potentially better describes true\nbehavior of inequality in the USA because the definitions of income used by the\nUS Census Bureau apparently fail to describe true income distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 18:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

In his lecture at\nthe 1994 International Congress of Mathematicians, Pomerance observed that the\nfollowing problem encapsulates all of the key issues: Select integers a_1, a_2,\n>... at random from the interval [1,x], until some (non-empty) subsequence has\nproduct equal to a square. Find good estimate for the expected stopping time of\nthis process. A good solution to this problem should help one to determine the\noptimal choice of parameters for one's factoring algorithm, and therefore this\nis a central question.\n  Pomerance (1994), using an idea of Schroeppel (1985), showed that with\nprobability 1-o(1) the first subsequence whose product equals a square occurs\nafter at least J_0^{1-o(1)} integers have been selected, but no more than J_0,\nfor an appropriate (explicitly determined) J_0=J_0(x). Herein we determine this\nexpected stopping time up to a constant factor, tightening Pomerance's interval\nto $$[ (\\pi/4)(e^{-\\gamma} - o(1))J_0, (e^{-\\gamma} + o(1)) J_0],$$ where\n$\\gamma = 0.577...$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

We use the extraordinary depth of this dataset to test whether\nthe colors and magnitudes show evidence for a mass-metallicity relation in\nglobular cluster populations. We find only a weak or absent relation between\nthe colors and magnitudes of the metal poor subpopulation of globular clusters.\nThe weakness or absence of a color-magnitude relation is established over a\nwide range in luminosity from $M_V=-11$ to $M_V=-6$, encompassing most of the\nM87 globular clusters. The constancy of the colors of the metal-poor\nsubpopulation seen in our 50 orbit observation is in contrast to suggestions\nfrom single orbit ACS data that the metal-poor globular clusters in M87 and\nseveral other galaxies show a \"blue tilt.\" The formal best fit for the\nmass-metallicity relation for the metal-poor subpopulation in our much deeper\ndata is $Z\\propto M^{0.08\\pm0.05}$. Our analysis of these data also shows a\npossible small \"red tilt\" in the metal-rich globular cluster subpopulation.\nWhile either of these small tilts may be real, they may also illustrate the\nlimit to which mass-metallicity relations can be determined, even in such\nextraordinarily deep data. We specifically test for a wide range of systematic\neffects and find that while small tilts cannot be confirmed or rejected, the\ndata place a strong upper limit to any tilt of $|0.20|\\pm0.05$. This upper\nlimit is much smaller than some earlier claims from single orbit data, and\nstrongly limits self-enrichment within globular clusters. This mass-metallicity\nrelation for globular clusters is also shallower than the relation for\ngalaxies, suggesting that the formation mechanisms for these two types of\nobjects are different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2008 21:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Correspondingly, film density varies with respect to bulk TiO2\nanatase, with a degree of porosity going from 48% to over 90%. These structures\nare stable with respect to heat treatment at 400 centigrade degrees, which\nresults in crystalline ordering but not in morphological changes down to the\nnanoscale.

In this review, we discuss various aspects of radiation driven\nmass loss, both from the theoretical and the observational side. We focus on\nwinds from OB-stars, with some excursions to the Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf-\nRayet stars, A-supergiants and Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae. After reca-\npitulating the 1-D, stationary standard model of line-driven wind, extensions\naccounting for rotation and magnetic fields are discussed. The relevance of the\nso-called bi-stability jump is outlined. We summarize diagnostical methods to\ninfer wind properties from observations, and compare the results with theore-\ntical predictions, featuring the massloss-metallicity dependence. Subsequently,\nwe concentrate on two urgent problems which challenge our present understanding\nof radiation driven winds: weak winds and wind- clumping. We discuss problems\nof measuring mass-loss rates from weak winds and the potential of NIR-\nspectroscopy. Wind-clumping has severe implications for the interpretation of\nobservational diagnostics, as derived mass-loss rates can be overestimated by\nfactors of 2 to 10 if clumping is ignored, and we describe ongoing attempts to\nallow for more uniform results. We point out that independent arguments from\nstellar evolution favor a moderate reduction of present- day mass-loss rates.\nWe also consider larger scale wind structure, interpreted in terms of\nco-rotating interacting regions, and complete this review with a discussion of\nrecent progress on the X-ray line emission from massive stars, highlighting as\nto how far the analysis of such X-ray line emission can give further clues\nregarding an adequate description of wind clumping.

The second\ncomponent is responsible for fluctuations around the economic trend and is\ndefined as a half of the growth rate of the number of 9-year-olds. This\nnonlinear relationship between the growth rate of real GDP per capita and the\nnumber of 9-year-olds in the USA is tested for cointegration.

In this\nformalism, the system's dynamics is parametrized along a system evolution\nparameter $s$, and the physical time $t$ is treated as a dependent variable\n$t(s)$ on equal footing with all other configuration space variables\n$q^{i}(s)$. In the action principle, the conventional classical action $L dt$\nis then replaced by the generalized action $L_{e}ds$, with $L$ and $L_{e}$\ndenoting the conventional and the extended Lagrangian, respectively. It is\nshown that a class of extended Lagrangians $L_{e}$ exists that are correlated\nto corresponding conventional Lagrangians $L$ without being homogeneous\nfunctions in the velocities. Then the Legendre transformation of $L_{e}$ to an\nextended Hamiltonian $H_{e}$ exists. With this class of extended Hamiltonians,\nan extended canonical formalism is presented that is completely analogous to\nthe conventional Hamiltonian formalism. The physical time $t$ and the negative\nvalue of the conventional Hamiltonian then constitute and an additional pair of\nconjugate canonical variables. The extended formalism also includes a theory of\nextended canonical transformations, where the time variable $t(s)$ is also\nsubject to transformation. In the extended formalism, the system's dynamics is\ndescribed as a motion on a hypersurface within an extended phase space of even\ndimension. With the extended Lagrangian $L_{e}$, it is shown that the\ngeneralized path integral approach yields the Klein-Gordon equation as the\ncorresponding quantum description. Moreover, the space-time propagator for a\nfree relativistic particle will be derived. These results can be regarded as\nthe proof of principle of the relativistic generalization of Feynman's path\nintegral approach to quantum physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2008 13:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 07:56:50 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 13:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 16:38:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 16:43:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 14:12:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 16:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 14:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 08:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 10:21:27 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 14:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

We show that such\ndepolarization can be explained quite naturally by the presence of an\nunresolved, highly entangled magnetic field, which averages to give the ordered\nfield inferred from spectro-polarimetric data, over the typical temporal and\nspatial scales of the observations. We present a modeling of the polarized HeI\n10830 in this scenario, and discuss its implications for the magnetic\ndiagnostics of prominences and spicules, and for the general study of\nunresolved magnetic field distributions in the solar atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2008 14:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

A State Transition between levels entails\nchanges of scale of observables and, concurrently, new formats of description\nat reduced dimensionality. It is here suggested that this principle can be\napplied to the hierarchic structure of the Nervous system, whereby the\nrelations between different levels of its functional organization can be viewed\nas successions of State Transitions. Upon State Transition, the lower level\npresents to the higher level an abstraction of itself, at reduced\ndimensionality and at a coarser scale. The re-scaling in the State Transitions\nis associated with new objects of description, displays new properties and\nobeys new laws, commensurate to the new scale. To illustrate this process, some\naspects of the neural events thought to be associated with Cognition and\nConsciousness are discussed.
