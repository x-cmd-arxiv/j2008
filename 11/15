We define a basis made of three mid-IR template spectra\nPAH$^0$, PAH$^+$ and VSGs that were derived from the analysis of reflection\nnebulae, and an additional PAH$^x$ spectrum that was introduced by Joblin et\nal. (2008) for the analysis of the spectra of planetary nebulae.

We find that the fraction of VSG\nemission in disks decreases with increasing stellar temperature. VSGs appear to\nbe destroyed by UV photons at the surface of disks, thus releasing free PAH\nmolecules, which are eventually ionized as it is observed in photodissociation\nregions. On the opposite, we observe that the fraction of PAH$^x$ increases\nwith increasing star temperature except in the case of B stars where they are\nabsent. We argue that this is compatible with the identification of PAH$^x$ as\nlarge ionized PAHs, most likely emitting in regions of the disk that are close\nto the star. Finally, we provide a UV-dependant scheme to explain the evolution\nof PAHs and VSGs in protoplanetary disks. We show that A stars modify the size\nspectrum of PAHs and VSGs in favor of large PAHs while B stars destroy even the\nlargest PAHs up to large radii in the disk.

Extending the theoretical formulation\ndeveloped earlier we present recombination rate coefficients for the 22\nsatellite lines of KLL complexes of helium-like Fe XXV and Ni XXVII. The\nisolated resonance approximation, commonly used throughout plasma modeling,\ntreats these resonances essentially as bound features except for dielectronic\ncapture into, and autoionization out of, these levels.

The\nobserved PNLF for the PN [O III] 5007 magnitudes and the cumulative PNLF were\ncalculated. We confirm that the PNLF presents a dip similar to the one detected\nfor the SMC at 2.5 mag down the maximum. The cumulative PNLF returns a value\nM^\\star_{5007}=-3.71^{+0.21}_{-0.42} for the peak absolute magnitude of the\nPNLF which is faint compared to the value expected for galaxies with\nmetallicity similar to the one of NGC 6822 but similar within uncertainties.\n  From our best fit to the observed PNLF we obtained a rough distance modulus\nm-M = 23.64 ^{+0.23}_{-0.43} mag, which agrees within uncertainties with recent\nvalues reported in the literature. The number of PN in the brightest 0.5 mag\nnormalized to the galactic bolometric luminosity, alpha_{0.5} was estimated to\nbe (3.8^{+0.90}_{-0.71}) E-9, which is similar to the values derived for\ngalaxies with recent star formation and small galaxies (M_B fainter than - 18\nmag).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2008 18:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

While the\nswitching dynamics are one of the most important characteristics of flagellar\nmotors, the mechanisms that control switching are poorly understood. We present\na statistical-mechanical model of the flagellar rotary motor, which consists of\na number of stator proteins that drive the rotation of a ring of rotor\nproteins, which in turn drives the rotation of a flagellar filament. At the\nheart of our model is the assumption that the rotor protein complex can exist\nin two conformational states corresponding to the two respective rotation\ndirections, and that switching between these states depends on interactions\nwith the stator proteins. This naturally couples the switching dynamics to the\nrotation dynamics, making the switch sensitive to torque and speed. Another key\nelement of our model is that after a switching event, it takes time for the\nload to build up, due to polymorphic transitions of the filament.

We reexamine the renormalisation group equations\n(RGEs) with a view to investigating flavour effects in a supersymmetric theory\nwith an arbitrary flavour structure at some high scale. To incorporate\n(two-loop sized) threshold effects in the one-loop RGEs, we calculate the\nbeta-functions using a sequence of (non-supersymmetric) effective theories with\nheavy particles decoupled at the scale of their mass, keeping track of the fact\nthat many couplings (such as gauge and gaugino couplings) which are equal in an\nexact supersymmetric theory may no longer be equal once the supersymmetry\n(SUSY) is broken. We find that this splitting, which is ignored in the\nliterature, may be larger than two-loop terms that are included. In addition,\ngaugino couplings develop flavour structure that is absent without including\ndecoupling effects. A program (to be incorporated into ISAJET) has been\ndeveloped, which includes flavour-violating couplings of superparticles and\nsolves the two-loop threshold RGEs subject to specified high scale inputs. The\nweak scale flavour structure derived in this way can be applied to the study of\nflavour-changing decays of SUSY particles. As an illustration, we revisit the\nbranching ratio of the flavour-violating decay of the top squark.

Using time-dependent calculations\nof the WD envelope, we investigate the sensitivity of the quiescent Teff to\nlong term variations in the accretion rate. We find that the quiescent Teff\nprovides one of the best available tests of predictions for the angular\nmomentum loss and resultant mass transfer rates which govern the evolution of\nCVs. While gravitational radiation is sufficient to explain the <Mdot> of\nstrongly magnetic CVs at all Porb, faster angular momentum loss is required by\nthe temperatures of dwarf nova primaries (non-magnetic systems). This provides\nevidence that a normal stellar magnetic field structure near the secondary is\nessential for the enhanced braking mechanism to work, supporting the well-known\nstellar wind braking hypothesis.

The first non-trivial algorithm,\nwith running time $O(mn)$, dates back to K\\\"{o}nig's work in 1916 (here $m=nd$\nis the number of edges in the graph, $2n$ is the number of vertices, and $d$ is\nthe degree of each node). The currently most efficient algorithm takes time\n$O(m)$, and is due to Cole, Ost, and Schirra. We improve this running time to\n$O(\\min\\{m, \\frac{n^{2.5}\\ln n}{d}\\})$; this minimum can never be larger than\n$O(n^{1.75}\\sqrt{\\ln n})$. We obtain this improvement by proving a uniform\nsampling theorem: if we sample each edge in a $d$-regular bipartite graph\nindependently with a probability $p = O(\\frac{n\\ln n}{d^2})$ then the resulting\ngraph has a perfect matching with high probability. The proof involves a\ndecomposition of the graph into pieces which are guaranteed to have many\nperfect matchings but do not have any small cuts. We then establish a\ncorrespondence between potential witnesses to non-existence of a matching\n(after sampling) in any piece and cuts of comparable size in that same piece.\nKarger's sampling theorem for preserving cuts in a graph can now be adapted to\nprove our uniform sampling theorem for preserving perfect matchings. Using the\n$O(m\\sqrt{n})$ algorithm (due to Hopcroft and Karp) for finding maximum\nmatchings in bipartite graphs on the sampled graph then yields the stated\nrunning time. We also provide an infinite family of instances to show that our\nuniform sampling result is tight up to poly-logarithmic factors (in fact, up to\n$\\ln^2 n$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2008 05:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-18"}

For more than a decade, the source\nof the bright H-alpha emission (up to 750 mR) along the Magellanic Stream has\nremained a mystery. We present a hydrodynamical model that explains the known\nproperties of the H-alpha emission and provides new insights on the lifetime of\nthe Stream clouds. The upstream clouds are gradually disrupted due to their\ninteraction with the hot halo gas. The clouds that follow plough into gas\nablated from the upstream clouds, leading to shock ionisation at the leading\nedges of the downstream clouds. Since the following clouds also experience\nablation, and weaker H-alpha (100-200 mR) is quite extensive, a disruptive\ncascade must be operating along much of the Stream. In order to light up much\nof the Stream as observed, it must have a small angle of attack (~20 deg) to\nthe halo, and this may already find support in new HI observations. Another\nprediction is that the Balmer ratio will be substantially enhanced due to the\nslow shock. We find that the clouds are evolving on timescales of 100-200 Myr,\nsuch that the Stream must be replenished by the Magellanic Clouds at a fairly\nconstant rate (>0.1 Msun/yr). The ablated material falls onto the Galaxy as a\nwarm drizzle; diffuse ionized gas at 10^4 K is an important constituent of\ngalactic accretion. We consider the stability of HI clouds falling towards the\nGalactic disk and show that most of these must break down into smaller\nfragments that become partially ionized. The Galactic halo is expected to have\nhuge numbers of smaller neutral and ionized fragments.

For that purpose, a direct imaging capability is\nnecessary. Direct imaging requires an efficient stellar suppression mechanism,\nassociated with an ultrasmooth telescope. We show that before future large\nspace missions (interferometer, 4-8 m class coronograph, external occulter or\nFresnel imager), direct imaging of giant planets and close-by super-Earth are\nat the cross-road of a high scientific interest and a reasonable feasibility.\nThe scientific interest lies in the fact that super-Earths share common\ngeophysical attributes with Earths. They already begin to be detected by radial\nvelocity (RV) and, together with giant planets, they have a larger area than\nEarths, making them detectable with a 1.5-2 m class telescope in reflected\nlight.

The Banzhaf index is a measure of voting power of an agent in\na weighted voting game. It depends on the number of coalitions in which the\nagent is the difference in the coalition winning or losing. It is well known\nthat computing Banzhaf indices in a weighted voting game is NP-hard. We give a\ncomprehensive classification of weighted voting games which can be solved in\npolynomial time.

We address the effect of a random magnetic field on synchrotron\nemission images and spectra. A random magnetic field is simulated to construct\nsynchrotron emission maps of a source with a steady distribution of\nultra-relativistic electrons. Non-steady localized structures (dots, clumps and\nfilaments), in which the magnetic field reaches exceptionally high values,\ntypically arise in the random field sample. These magnetic field concentrations\ndominate the synchrotron emission (integrated along the line of sight) from the\nhighest energy electrons in the cut-off regime of the distribution, resulting\nin an evolving, intermittent, clumpy appearance. The simulated structures\nresemble those observed in X-ray images of some young supernova remnants. The\nlifetime of X-ray clumps can be short enough to be consistent with that\nobserved even in the case of a steady particle distribution. The efficiency of\nsynchrotron radiation from the cut-off regime in the electron spectrum is\nstrongly enhanced in a turbulent field compared to emission from a uniform\nfield of the same magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2008 14:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-22"}
