We provide a simple\n'universal' fitting formula that describes our derived merger rates for dark\nmatter halos a function of dark halo mass, merger mass ratio, and redshift, and\ngo on to predict galaxy merger rates using number density-matching to associate\nhalos with galaxies. For example, we find that the instantaneous merger rate of\nm/M>0.3 mass ratio events into typical L > f L* galaxies follows the simple\nrelation dN/dt=0.03(1+f)(1+z)^2.1 Gyr^-1. Despite the rapid increase in merger\nrate with redshift, only a small fraction of >0.4 L* high-redshift galaxies\n(~3% at z=2) should have experienced a major merger (m/M >0.3) in the very\nrecent past (t< 100 Myr).

The motion of fibres\nis described using the Jeffery equation and the contribution of fibres to the\nflow is accounted for by the configuration field method. The governing\nNavier-Stokes equation for the fluid flow is solved using the projection method\nwith finite difference scheme, while the fibre-related equations are directly\nsolved with the Runge-Kutta method. Our findings indicate that the fibre motion\nhas strong influence on the distributions of the streamwise and transverse\nvelocities in the fountain flow. Fibre motion produces strong normal stress\nnear the wall which leads to the reduction of transversal velocity as compared\nto the Newtonian flow without fibres and in turn the streamwise velocity near\nthe wall is increased. Thus, the fibre addition to the flow weakens the\nstrength of the fountain flow. It is also found that the fibre orientation is\nnot always along the direction of velocity vector in the process of mold\nfilling. In the region of the fountain flow, the fibre near the centerline is\nmore oriented cross the streamwise direction comparing to that in the region\nfar behind the flow front. This leads to that the fibre near the centreline in\nthe region of fountain flow is more extended along the transverse direction.\nSince fibre orientation in the suspension flow and the shape of the flow front\nhave great bearing on the quality of the product made from injection molding,\nthis study has much implications for engineering applications.

It is based on a microscopic model for pion production\noff the nucleon that, besides the dominant Delta pole contribution, takes into\naccount the effect of background terms required by chiral symmetry. Moreover,\nthe model uses a reduced nucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads\nto coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than\nmost of the previous theoretical estimates. In the coherent production, the\nmain nuclear effects, namely medium corrections on the Delta propagator and the\nfinal pion distortion, are included. We have improved on previous similar\nmodels by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more\nsophisticated optical potential. As found in previous calculations the\nmodification of the Delta self-energy inside the nuclear medium strongly\nreduces the cross section, while the final pion distortion mainly shifts the\npeak position to lower pion energies. The angular distribution profiles are not\nmuch affected by nuclear effects. Nucleon motion increases the cross section by\n15% at neutrino energies of 650 MeV, while Coulomb effects on charged pions are\nestimated to be small. Finally, we discuss at length the deficiencies of the\nRein-Sehgal pion coherent production model for neutrino energies below 2 GeV,\nand in particular for the MiniBooNE and T2K experiments.

On the other hand, we found the distribution of\nthe HCN(J=1-0) line emission which traces dense molecular gas (nH2 > a few x\n10^4 cm^-3) shows nuclear single peak structure and coincides well with that of\nthe 95 GHz continuum emission which traces massive starburst. The peaks of the\nHCN(J=1-0) line and the 95 GHz continuum emission are not spatially coincident\nwith the optical starburst regions traced by the HST V-band image. This\nsuggests the existence of deeply buried ongoing starburst due to strong\nextinction (A_v ~ 5 mag) near the peaks of the HCN(J=1-0) line and the 95 GHz\ncontinuum emission. We found that the HCN(J=1-0)/CO(J=1-0) intensity ratio\nR_HCN/CO correlates well with extinction-corrected SFE in the central region of\nM 83 at a resolution of 7.5\" (~ 160 pc). This suggests that SFE is controlled\nby dense gas fraction traced by R_HCN/CO even on a Giant Molecular cloud\nAssociation (GMA) scale. Moreover, the correlation between R_HCN/CO and the SFE\nin the central region of M 83 seems to be almost coincident with that of the\nGao & Solomon (2004a) sample. This suggests that the correlation between\nR_HCN/CO and the SFE on a GMA (~ 160 pc) scale found in M 83 is the origin of\nthe global correlation on a few kpc scale shown by Gao & Solomon (2004a).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2008 09:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2008 01:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We have used the XMS\nsurvey along with other highly complete flux-limited deeper and shallower\nsurveys for a total of 1009, 435 and 119 sources in the Soft, Hard and\nUltrahard bands, respectively. We have modeled the intrinsic absorption of the\nHard and Ultrahard sources (NH function) and computed the intrinsic X-ray\nluminosity function in all bands using a Maximum Likelihood fit technique to an\nanalytical model. We find that the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) is best\ndescribed by a Luminosity-Dependent Density Evolution (LDDE) model. Our results\nshow a good overall agreement with previous results in the Hard band, although\nwith slightly weaker evolution. Our model in the Soft band present slight\ndiscrepancies with other works in this band, the shape of our present day XLF\nbeing significantly flatter. We find faster evolution in the AGN detected in\nthe Ultrahard band than those in the Hard band. The fraction of absorbed AGN in\nthe Hard and Ultrahard bands is dependent on the X-ray luminosity. We find\nevidence of evolution of this fraction with redshift in the Hard band but not\nin the Ultrahard band, possibly due to the low statistics. Our best-fit XLF\nshows that the high-luminosity AGN are fully formed earlier than the less\nluminous AGN. The latter sources account for the vast majority of the accretion\nrate and mass density of the Universe, according to an anti-hierarchical black\nhole growth scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2008 11:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Assuming the two lighter heavy Majorana neutrinos are degenerate\nat the GUT scale, it is shown that the renormalization group (RG) evolution\nfrom the GUT scale to the seesaw scale gives rise to breaking of the mu-tau\nsymmetry and a tiny splitting between two degenerate heavy Majorana neutrino\nmasses as well as small variations of the CP phases in Y_nu, which are\nessential to achieve a successful leptogenesis. Such small RG effects lead to\ntiny deviations of theta_{23} from the maximal value and the CP phase\ndelta_{CP} from pi/2 imposed at the GUT scale due to mu-tau reflection\nsymmetry. In our scenario, the required amount of the baryon asymmetry eta_B\ncan be generated via so-called resonant e-leptogenesis, in which the wash-out\nfactor concerned with electron flavor plays a crucial role in reproducing a\nsuccessful leptogenesis.

Bright formyl radical emission\ndelineates the illuminated edge of the nebula, with a faint emission remaining\ntowards the shielded molecular core. Viewed from the illuminated star, the HCO\nemission almost coincides with the PAH and CCH emission. HCO reaches a similar\nabundance than HCO+ in the PDR (~1-2 x10^{-9} with respect to H2). Pure\ngas-phase chemistry models fail to reproduce the observed HCO abundance by ~2\norders of magnitude, except if reactions of OI with carbon radicals abundant in\nthe PDR (i.e., CH2) play a significant role in the HCO formation.\nAlternatively, HCO could be produced in the PDR by non-thermal processes such\nas photo-processing of ice mantles and subsequent photo-desorption of either\nHCO or H2CO, and further gas phase photodissociation. The measured HCO/H13CO+\nabundance ratio is large towards the PDR (~50), and much lower toward the gas\nshielded from FUV radiation (<1). We propose that high HCO abundances\n(>10^{-10}) together with large HCO/H13CO+ abundance ratios (>1) are sensitive\ndiagnostics of the presence of active photochemistry induced by FUV radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2008 13:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
