The\nmesons in the small lambda limit should have a Regge spectrum in order to agree\nwith perturbation theory, while generically the large lambda theories with\ngravity duals produce spectra reminiscent of KK modes. We argue that these\nKK-like states are qualitatively different from QCD modes: they are deeply\nbound states which are sensitive to short distance interactions rather than the\nflux tube-like states expected in asymptotically free, confining gauge\ntheories. In addition, we also find that the characteristic event shapes for\nthe large lambda theories with gravity duals are close to spherical, very\ndifferent from QCD-like (small lambda, small N) and Nambu-Goto-like (small\nlambda, large N) theories which have jets. This observation is in agreement\nwith the conjecture of Strassler on event shapes in large 't Hooft coupling\ntheories, which was recently proved by Hofman and Maldacena for the conformal\ncase. This conclusion does not change even when considering soft-wall\nbackgrounds in the gravity dual. The picture that emerges is the following:\ntheories with small and large lambda are qualitatively different, while\ntheories with small and large N are qualitatively similar. Thus it seems that\nit is the relative smallness of the 't Hooft coupling in QCD that prevents a\nreliable AdS/QCD correspondence from emerging, and that reproducing\ncharacteristic QCD-like behavior will require genuine stringy dynamics to be\nincorporated into any putative dual theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 20:43:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 16:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-29"}

This\nconclusion is drawn by comparing molecular dynamics simulations at constant\ntemperature with the dynamics on the graph, defined by a temperature dependent\nMarkov process. The main advantage of the graph representation is that its\ndynamics can be naturally renormalized by collecting nodes into \"hubs\", while\nredefining their connectivity.

A standard way of probing such heterogeneities is by\nmonitoring the fluctuations of correlation and susceptibility, coarse-grained\nover mesoscopic regions. We discuss how to define fluctuating coarse-grained\ncorrelations (C) and susceptibilities (Chi) in models where no quenched\ndisorder is present. Our focus for the spherical model is on coarse-graining\nover the whole volume of $N$ spins, which requires accounting for N^{-1/2}\nnon-Gaussian fluctuations of the spin. The latter are treated as a perturbation\nabout the leading order Gaussian statistics. We obtain exact results for these\nquantities, which enable us to characterise the joint distribution of C and Chi\nfluctuations. We find that this distribution is qualitatively different, even\nfor equilibrium above criticality, from the spin-glass scenario where C and Chi\nfluctuations are linked in a manner akin to the fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation between the average C and Chi. Our results show that coarsening at\ncriticality is clearly heterogeneous for d>4 and suggest that, as in other\nglassy systems, there is a well-defined timescale on which fluctuations across\nthermal histories are largest. Surprisingly, however, neither this timescale\nnor the amplitude of the heterogeneities increase with the age of the system,\nas would be expected from the growing correlation length.

We show, that handling the space-time\ncoordinates as implicit variables in the gauge field, reproduces the same\nresults that have been derived in the configuration space (i.e., we do not lose\ninformation), while the proposed new treatment gives additional information\nextending those. The result is an extra conserved Noether current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 20:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In addition, the polarization position angle (PA)\nobtained using the line effect can constrain the symmetry axis of the disk.\nResults: RY Tau shown a variable Halpha double peak on 2004-2005 data.\nPolarization line effect is evident on the Q-U diagram for both epochs\nconfirming a clockwise rotating disk. A single loop is evident on 2004 changing\nto a linear excursion plus a loop on 2005. Interestingly, the intrinsic PA\ncalculated using the line effect is consistent between our two epochs\n(~167deg). An alternative intrinsic PA computed from the interstellar\npolarization corrected continuum and averaged between 2001-2005 yielded a PA\n137deg. This last value is closer to be perpendicular to the observed disk\ndirection (~25deg) as expected by single scattering in an optically thin disk.\nFor PX Vul, we detected spectral variability in Halpha along with non-variable\ncontinuum polarization when compared with previous data. The Q-U diagram shows\na well-defined loop in Halpha associated to a counter-clockwise rotating disk.\nThe symmetry axis inferred by the line effect has a PA~91deg (with an ambiguity\nof 90deg). Our results confirm previous evidence that the emission line in T\nTauri stars has its origin in a compact source scattered off a rotating\naccretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 21:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The BCFW recursion relations for\nmassless particles of spin 1 and 2 imply that the whole tree-level S-matrix can\nbe determined in terms of three-particle amplitudes (evaluated at complex\nmomenta). However, the known proofs of the validity of the relations rely on\nthe Lagrangian of the theory, either by using Feynman diagrams explicitly or by\nstudying the effective theory at large complex momenta. This means that a\npurely S-matrix theoretic proof of the relations is still missing. The aim of\nthis paper is to provide such a proof for spin 1 particles by extending the\nfour-particle test introduced by P. Benincasa and F. Cachazo in\narXiv:0705.4305[hep-th] to all particles. We show how n-particle tests imply\nthat the rational function built from the BCFW recursion relations possesses\nall the correct factorization channels including holomorphic and\nanti-holomorphic collinear limits.

We conclude that\nthis work provides a bias free, low dispersion photometric redshift catalog,\nthat we have criteria at hand to select a 'robust' subsample with fewer\noutliers. Such a subsample is very useful to study the redshift dependent\ngrowth of the dark matter fluctuations with weak lensing cosmic shear analyses\nor to investigate the redshift dependent weak lensing signal behind clusters of\ngalaxies in the framework of dark energy equation of state constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 21:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-21"}

We investigate the validity of the mass segregation indicators commonly\nused in analysing young stellar clusters. Methods.

We\nfind that commonly used indicators are highly sensitive to sample\nincompleteness in observational data and that radial completeness\ndeterminations do not provide satisfactory corrections, rendering the studies\nof radial properties highly uncertain.

Conclusions. We argue that there is currently no observational\nevidence of mass segregation in young compact clusters since there is no robust\nway to differentiate between true mass segregation and sample incompleteness\neffects.

Such approximation may not\nbe valid in the presence of an important external net potential. In the present\nwork we analyze the effect of an external gravitational field on the\ngravitational budget of a density structure. Our cases under analysis are (a) a\ngiant molecular cloud (GMC) with different aspect ratios embedded within a\ngalactic net potential, and (b) a molecular cloud core embedded within the\ngravitational potential of its parent molecular cloud. We find that for\nroundish GMCs, the tidal tearing due to the shear in the plane of the galaxy is\ncompensated by the tidal compression in the z direction. The influence of the\nexternal effective potential on the total gravitational budget of these clouds\nis relatively small, although not necessarily negligible. However, for more\nfilamentary GMCs, the external effective potential can be dominant and can even\noverwhelm self-gravity, regardless of whether its main effect on the cloud is\nto disrupt it or compress it. This may explain the presence of some GMCs with\nfew or no signs of massive star formation, such as the Taurus or the\nMaddalena's clouds. In the case of dense cores embedded in their parent\nmolecular cloud, we found that the gravitational content due to the external\nfield may be more important than the gravitational energy of the cores\nthemselves. This effect works in the same direction as the gravitational\nenergy, i.e., favoring the collapse of cores. We speculate on the implications\nof these results for star formation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 22:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In Floquet systems all quasienergies\ncan be placed in a finite frequency interval, and the number of near\ndegeneracies in this interval grows without limit as the dimension N of the\nHilbert space increases. This leads to pathologies, including drastic changes\nin the Floquet states, as N increases. In earlier work these difficulties were\nput aside by fixing N, while taking the coupling to the bath to be smaller than\nany quasienergy difference. This led to a simple explicit theory for the\nreduced density matrix, but with some major differences from the usual time\nindependent statistical mechanics. We show that, for weak but finite coupling\nbetween system and heat bath, the accuracy of a calculation within the\ntruncated Hilbert space spanned by the N lowest energy eigenstates of the\nundriven system is limited, as N increases indefinitely, only by the usual\nneglect of bath memory effects within the Born and Markov approximations. As we\nseek higher accuracy by increasing N, we inevitably encounter quasienergy\ndifferences smaller than the system-bath coupling. We therefore derive the\nsteady state reduced density matrix without restriction on the size of\nquasienergy splittings. In general, it is no longer diagonal in the Floquet\nstates. We analyze, in particular, the behavior near a weakly avoided crossing,\nwhere quasienergy near degeneracies routinely appear. The explicit form of our\nresults for the denisty matrix gives a consistent prescription for the\nstatistical mechanics for many periodically driven systems with N infinite, in\nspite of the Floquet state pathologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 00:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The energy range in the sample is harder than\nthat usually used in the similar previous studies. These AGNs are mainly\ncomplied from the RXTE All Sky Survey (XSS), and complemented by the released\nINTEGRAL AGN catalog. The black hole masses, bolometric luminosities of AGN,\nand Eddington ratios are derived from their optical spectra in terms of the\nbroad H$\\beta$ emission line. The tight correlation between the hard X-ray\n(3-20keV) and bolometric/line luminosity is well identified in our sample. Also\nidentified is a strong inverse Baldwin relationship of the H$\\beta$ emission\nline. In addition, all these hard X-ray AGNs are biased toward luminous objects\nwith high Eddington ratio (mostly between 0.01 to 0.1) and low column density\n($<10^{22} \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$), which is most likely due to the selection effect\nof the surveys.

Finally, the\ncorrelation between RFe (=optical FeII/H$\\beta$) and disk temperature as\nassessed by $T\\propto (L/L_{\\mathrm{Edd}})M_{\\mathrm{BH}}^{-1}$ leads us to\nsuggest that the strength of the FeII emission is mainly determined by the\nshape of the ionizing spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 03:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-19"}

The\ninput quantities for each system are the results of the light curve analyses\n(Paper 1), and published measurements of the stellar velocity amplitude, Teff\nand [Fe/H]. The physical properties are determined by interpolating within\ntabulated predictions from stellar theory. Statistical uncertainties are found\nusing a perturbation algorithm, which gives a detailed error budget for every\noutput quantity. Systematic uncertainties are assessed for each quantity by\ncomparing the values found using different stellar models. As a theory-free\nalternative, physical properties are also calculated using an empirical\nmass-radius relation constructed using low-mass eclipsing binary stars. The\nproperties of the planets depend mostly on parameters measured from the light\nand velocity curves, and have only a minor sensitivity to theoretical\npredictions. In contrast, the orbital semimajor axes and stellar masses have a\nstrong dependence on theoretical predictions, and their systematic\nuncertainties can be substantially larger than the statistical ones. Using the\nempirical mass--radius relation instead, their values are smaller by up to 15%.\nThus our understanding of extrasolar planets is currently limited by our lack\nof understanding of low-mass stars. Using all known transiting planets, I find\nthat correlations between their orbital periods, masses and surface gravities\nare significant at the 2-3 sigma level.

This very rare event was interpreted as the\nreignition of a hot white dwarf that caused a rapid evolution back to the cool\ngiant phase. From 1998 on, a copious amount of dust has formed continuously,\nscreening out the star which has remained embedded in this expanding high\noptical depth envelope. The new observations, reported here, are used to study\nthe morphology of the circumstellar dust in order to investigate the hypothesis\nthat Sakurai's Object is surrounded by a thick spherical envelope of dust. We\nhave obtained unprecedented, high-angular resolution spectro-interferometric\nobservations, taken with the mid-IR interferometer MIDI/VLTI, which resolve the\ndust envelope of Sakurai's object. We report the discovery of a unexpectedly\ncompact (30 x 40 milliarcsec, 105 x 140 AU assuming a distance of 3.5 kpc),\nhighly inclined, dust disk. We used Monte Carlo radiative-transfer simulations\nof a stratified disk to constrain its geometric and physical parameters,\nalthough such a model is only a rough approximation of the rapidly evolving\ndust structure. Even though the fits are not fully satisfactory, some useful\nand robust constraints can be inferred. The disk inclination is estimated to be\n75+/-3 degree with a large scale height of 47+/-7 AU. The dust mass of the disk\nis estimated to be 6 10^{-5} solar mass. The major axis of the disk (132+/-3\ndegree) is aligned with an asymmetry seen in the old PN that was\nre-investigated as part of this study. This implies that the mechanism\nresponsible for shaping the dust envelope surrounding Sakurai's object was\nalready at work when the old PN formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 09:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Moreover, the main\nresult of the present work is that even if the assumptions on steadiness and on\nthe geometry are fully satisfied, serious limitations in the application of the\nmodel are found: (i) in the absence of down-stream boundary conditions the\nmodel is not related to the physical process(es) that originate the shock, (ii)\nmatter shocked during the presumed phase of steadiness of the shock is not\nhydrodynamically interacting with previously shocked matter, and (iii) the\nsteady-state model assumes that the flow is stable against perturbations.\nFurthermore, even if boundary conditions were assumed, the link between the\nsteady model and the astrophysical context would not be strictly speaking the\ncorrect HD link. Time-dependent HD computations in different astrophysical\ncontexts (e.g. SNRs and molecular shocks) show that the steady-state\napproximation is inadequate to describe these post-shock structures.

In this paper we show that under the\nassumption of the existence of a uniform additive model error term, ABC\nalgorithms give exact results when sufficient summaries are used. This\ninterpretation allows the approximation made in many previous application\npapers to be understood, and should guide the choice of metric and tolerance in\nfuture work. ABC algorithms can be generalized by replacing the 0-1 cut-off\nwith an acceptance probability that varies with the distance of the simulated\ndata from the observed data. The acceptance density gives the distribution of\nthe error term, enabling the uniform error usually used to be replaced by a\ngeneral distribution. This generalization can also be applied to approximate\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. In light of this work, ABC algorithms can\nbe seen as calibration techniques for implicit stochastic models, inferring\nparameter values in light of the computer model, data, prior beliefs about the\nparameter values, and any measurement or model errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 15:36:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 11:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}
