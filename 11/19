The launch of\nFermi offers the prospect of observations with unprecedented sensitivity in\nhigh-energy (>100 MeV) gamma-rays. The aim is to explore the predictions for HE\nemission from internal shocks, taking into account both dynamical and radiative\naspects, and to deduce how HE observations constrain the properties of the\nrelativistic outflow. The emission is modeled by combining a time-dependent\nradiative code with a dynamical code giving the evolution of the physical\nconditions in the shocked regions.Synthetic lightcurves and spectra are\ncompared to observations. The HE emission deviates significantly from\nanalytical estimates, which tend to overpredict the IC component, when the time\ndependence and full cross-sections are included. The exploration of the\nparameter space favors the case where the dominant process in the BATSE range\nis synchrotron emission. The HE component becomes stronger for weaker magnetic\nfields. The HE lightcurve can display a prolonged pulse duration due to IC\nemission, or even a delayed peak compared to the BATSE range.Alternatively,\nhaving dominant IC emission in the BATSE range requires most electrons to be\naccelerated into a steep power-law distribution and implies strong 2nd order IC\nscattering.

We apply here the model to the broad-band\nSED's of a sample of known, X-ray emitting GPS galaxies, and show that: (i) the\nfree-free absorption mechanism enables us to reproduce the radio continuum at\nfrequencies below the turnover; (ii) the lobes' non-thermal, inverse-Compton\nemission can account for the observed X-ray spectra, providing a viable\nalternative to the thermal, accretion-dominated scenario.

Chemisorbed\nhydrogen atoms, which give rise to a prominent Raman D band, can be detached by\nthermal annealing at 100~200 degrees C. The resulting dehydrogenated graphene\nis \"activated\" when photothermally heated it reversibly binds ambient oxygen,\nleading to hole doping of the graphene. This functionalization of graphene can\nbe exploited to manipulate electronic and charge transport properties of\ngraphene devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 00:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-16"}

They are especially useful in external\nmemory, where their query performance approaches the ideal cost of just one\ndisk access. Knuth gave an elegant analysis showing that with some simple\ncollision resolution strategies such as linear probing or chaining, the\nexpected average number of disk I/Os of a lookup is merely $1+1/2^{\\Omega(b)}$,\nwhere each I/O can read a disk block containing $b$ items. Inserting a new item\ninto the hash table also costs $1+1/2^{\\Omega(b)}$ I/Os, which is again almost\nthe best one can do if the hash table is entirely stored on disk. However, this\nassumption is unrealistic since any algorithm operating on an external hash\ntable must have some internal memory (at least $\\Omega(1)$ blocks) to work\nwith. The availability of a small internal memory buffer can dramatically\nreduce the amortized insertion cost to $o(1)$ I/Os for many external memory\ndata structures. In this paper we study the inherent query-insertion tradeoff\nof external hash tables in the presence of a memory buffer. In particular, we\nshow that for any constant $c>1$, if the query cost is targeted at\n$1+O(1/b^{c})$ I/Os, then it is not possible to support insertions in less than\n$1-O(1/b^{\\frac{c-1}{4}})$ I/Os amortized, which means that the memory buffer\nis essentially useless. While if the query cost is relaxed to $1+O(1/b^{c})$\nI/Os for any constant $c<1$, there is a simple dynamic hash table with $o(1)$\ninsertion cost. These results also answer the open question recently posed by\nJensen and Pagh.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 08:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-20"}

Motivated\nby this crucial, but subtle role of the boundary, we have simulated here the\ncase of a finite but \\emph{unbounded} system, namely that of a charged particle\nmoving on the surface of a sphere in the presence of an externally applied\nuniform magnetic field. Following a real space-time approach based on the\nclassical Langevin equation, we have computed the orbital magnetic moment which\nnow indeed turns out to be non-zero, and has the diamagnetic sign. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first report of the possibility of finite\nclassical diamagnetism in principle, and it is due to the avoided cancellation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 09:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 04:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2009 05:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-21"}

Magnetic\nfluctuations above $T_N$ are coupled to the crystal lattice as manifested by\nnegative thermal expansion. Both, the complex magnetic structure and the\nanomalous structural behavior can be related to magnetic frustration.\nApplication of an external magnetic field shifts the ordering temperature and\nthe regime of negative thermal expansion towards lower temperatures. Thereby,\nthe spin ordering changes into a conical structure. ZnCr$_2$S$_4$ shows two\nmagnetic transitions at $T_{N1}=15$ K and $T_{N2}=8$ K that are accompanied by\nstructural phase transitions. The crystal structure transforms from the cubic\nspinel-type (space group $Fd$\\={3}$m$) at high temperatures in the paramagnetic\nstate, via a tetragonally distorted intermediate phase (space group $I4_1$ /\n$amd$) for $T_{N2} < T < T_{N1}$ into a low temperature orthorhombic phase\n(space group $I m m a$) for $T < T_{N2}$.

The model leads to the formulation of a global optimization\nproblem, whose solutions correspond to conformations satisfying the desired\nrequirements. The global optimization problem is solved by the recently\nproposed Monkey Search algorithm. The simplicity of the optimization problem\nand the effectiveness of the used meta-heuristic search allowed the simulation\nof a large set of high-quality conformations. We show that, even though only\nfew geometric requirements are imposed, some of the simulated conformation\nresults to be similar (in terms of RMSD) to conformations real proteins\nactually have in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 11:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-20"}

The\nmodelled results are examined at the surface and on a series of time-height\ncross sections at several locations spread over the Atlantic, the Indian, and\nthe Pacific Oceans. Comparison of model with surface measurements at remote MBL\nstations indicate a close agreement. The most striking feature of the\nhemispheric spring ozone maximum in the MBL can be most easily identified at\nthe NH sites of Westman Island, Bermuda, and Mauna Loa, and at the SH site of\nSamoa. Modelled ozone vertical distributions in the troposphere are compared\nwith ozone profiles. For the Atlantic and the Indian sites, the model generally\nproduces a hemispheric spring ozone maximum close to those of the measurements.\nThe model also produces a spring ozone maximum in the northeastern and tropical\nnorth Pacific close to those measurements, and at sites in the NH high\nlatitudes. The good agreement between model and measurements indicate that the\nmodel can reproduce the proposed mechanisms responsible for producing the\nspring ozone maximum in these regions of the MBL, lending confidence in the use\nof the model to investigate MBL ozone chemistry (see part 2 and part 3). The\nspring ozone maximum in the tropical central south Pacific and eastern\nequatorial Pacific are less well reproduced by the model, indicating that both\nthe transport of $O_3$ precursors from biomass burning emissions taking place\nin southeastern Asia, Australia, Oceania, southern Africa, and South America\nare not well represented in the model in these regions. Overall, the model\nproduces a better simulation at sites where the stratosphere and biomass\nburning emissions are the major contributors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 13:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-20"}

We show\nthat the transition from quantum to classical regime may be tuned by\ncontrolling the intensities of the seeds and detected by intensity\nmeasurements. Besides, we show that the thresholds are not affected by losses,\nwhich only modify the amount of nonclassicality.

Similarly, polarimetry has also yielded excellent\nastrophysical results, e.g., characterizing the atmospheres and shells of red\ngiants/supergiants, modeling the envelopes of AGB stars, studying the\nmorphology of Be stars, and monitoring the short- and long- term behavior of\nAGNs. The next logical evolutionary step in instrumentation is to combine LBOI\nwith polarimetry, which is called optical interferometric polarimetry (OIP). In\nother words, measurements of spatial coherence are performed simultaneously\nwith measurements of coherence between orthogonal polarization states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 15:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-13"}

This prior information is often qualitative in nature, making\nthe translation of the available information into a computational model a\nchallenging task. We propose a generalized gamma family of hyperpriors which\nallows the impressed currents to be focal and we advocate a fast and efficient\niterative algorithm, the Iterative Alternating Sequential (IAS) algorithm for\ncomputing maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates. Furthermore, we show that for\nparticular choices of the scalar parameters specifying the hyperprior, the\nalgorithm effectively approximates popular regularization strategies such as\nthe Minimum Current Estimate and the Minimum Support Estimate. The connection\nbetween priorconditioning and adaptive regularization methods is also pointed\nout. The posterior densities are explored by means of a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) strategy suitable for this family of hypermodels. The computed\nexperiments suggest that the known preference of regularization methods for\nsuperficial sources over deep sources is a property of the MAP estimators only,\nand that estimation of the posterior mean in the hierarchical model is better\nadapted for localizing deep sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 15:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-20"}
