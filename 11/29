Some recent\nwatermarking algorithms deal with host interference using side informed\nmethods, but inter-symbols interference problem is still open.

Due to limited communication bandwidth and other resource\nconstraints, a critical and practical demand is to online compress data streams\ncontinuously with quality guarantee. Although many data compression and digital\nsignal processing methods have been developed to reduce data volume, their\nsuper-linear time and more-than-constant space complexity prevents them from\nbeing applied directly on data streams, particularly over resource-constrained\nsensor networks. In this paper, we tackle the problem of online quality\nguaranteed compression of data streams using fast linear approximation (i.e.,\nusing line segments to approximate a time series). Technically, we address two\nversions of the problem which explore quality guarantees in different forms. We\ndevelop online algorithms with linear time complexity and constant cost in\nspace. Our algorithms are optimal in the sense they generate the minimum number\nof segments that approximate a time series with the required quality guarantee.\nTo meet the resource constraints in sensor networks, we also develop a fast\nalgorithm which creates connecting segments with very simple computation.

Its period, 21.2 Earth days, is the longest\namong the known transiting planets. The atmosphere of the planet undergoes a\n27-fold variation in stellar irradiation during each orbit, making it an\ninteresting subject for atmospheric modelling.

A resonant shock\n(torque) couples the radial (tangential) motion of a satellite in its orbit to\nits phase space. For a satellite on a circular orbit, an ILR-like resonance\ndominates the heating and this heating results in continuous satellite mass\nloss. We estimate the requirements for simulations to achieve these dynamics\nusing perturbation theory. Both resonant shocks and resonant torques affect\nsatellites on eccentric orbits.

These kinetic properties allow the system to selectively\nrespond to sustained (as opposed to transient) stimuli, and thus establish a\ntemporal threshold, which prevents energetically costly IsiA accumulation under\nshort-term stress conditions.

The basic idea of\nFNS is to treat the correlation links present in sequences of different\nirregularities, such as spikes, \"jumps\", and discontinuities in derivatives of\ndifferent orders, on all levels of the spatiotemporal hierarchy of the system\nunder study as main information carriers. The tools to extract and analyze the\ninformation are power spectra and difference moments (structural functions) of\nvarious orders. Presently, FNS can be applied to three types of problems: (1)\ndetermination of parameters or patterns that characterize the dynamics or\nstructural features of complex systems; (2) finding precursors of abrupt\nchanges in the state of various complex systems based on a priori information\nabout the dynamics of the systems; and (3) determination of flow dynamics in\ndistributed systems based on the analysis of dynamic correlations in stochastic\nsignals that are simultaneously measured at different points in space.

The method, termed indirect cross-validation, or ICV, makes use of\nso-called selection kernels. Least squares cross-validation (LSCV) is used to\nselect the bandwidth of a selection-kernel estimator, and this bandwidth is\nappropriately rescaled for use in a Gaussian kernel estimator. The proposed\nselection kernels are linear combinations of two Gaussian kernels, and need not\nbe unimodal or positive. Theory is developed showing that the relative error of\nICV bandwidths can converge to 0 at a rate of $n^{-1/4}$, which is\nsubstantially better than the $n^{-1/10}$ rate of LSCV. Interestingly, the\nselection kernels that are best for purposes of bandwidth selection are very\npoor if used to actually estimate the density function.

Many natural families of\nchains are believed to exhibit cutoff, and yet establishing this fact is often\nextremely challenging. An important such family of chains is the random walk on\n$\\G(n,d)$, a random $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices. It is well known that\nalmost every such graph for $d\\geq 3$ is an expander, and even essentially\nRamanujan, implying a mixing-time of $O(\\log n)$. According to a conjecture of\nPeres, the simple random walk on $\\G(n,d)$ for such $d$ should then exhibit\ncutoff with high probability. As a special case of this, Durrett conjectured\nthat the mixing time of the lazy random walk on a random 3-regular graph is\nw.h.p. $(6+o(1))\\log_2 n$.\n  In this work we confirm the above conjectures, and establish cutoff in\ntotal-variation, its location and its optimal window, both for simple and for\nnon-backtracking random walks on $\\G(n,d)$. Namely, for any fixed $d\\geq3$, the\nsimple random walk on $\\G(n,d)$ w.h.p. has cutoff at $\\frac{d}{d-2}\\log_{d-1}\nn$ with window order $\\sqrt{\\log n}$. Surprisingly, the non-backtracking random\nwalk on $\\G(n,d)$ w.h.p. has cutoff already at $\\log_{d-1} n$ with constant\nwindow order. We further extend these results to $\\G(n,d)$ for any $d=n^{o(1)}$\nthat grows with $n$ (beyond which the mixing time is O(1)), where we establish\nconcentration of the mixing time on one of two consecutive integers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2008 08:54:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2009 19:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

I\nsummarize the salient features of the calculational framework adopted, discuss\nthe results obtained in the last few years, and indicate the technical tools\nthat made the NNLO calculations possible. I conclude by comparing the current\nNNLO theoretical estimate for the branching ratio with the experimental\nmeasurement and by briefly discussing the size and origin of the residual\ntheoretical uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2008 15:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}

This is\ncaused by finite differentiability of the dose-volume histogram at such values.\nA closer look near such values reveals that convergence is most likely not at\nstake, but it might be slowed down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2008 15:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

The Majorana masses for the gauge-singlet neutrinos as\nwell as the usual $\\mu$-term for the Higgs superfields are generated at the\nelectroweak scale through the vacuum expectation values of the singlet\nsneutrinos. The resulting effective mass matrix for the three light neutrinos\nhave contributions from the seesaw mechanism involving the singlet neutrinos as\nwell as due to the mixing with the heavy neutralinos. This model is popularly\nknown in the literature as the \"$\\mu$ from $\\nu$ supersymmetric standard model\"\n($\\mu\\nu$SSM). We show that even with flavour diagonal neutrino Yukawa\ncouplings, the global data on three-flavour neutrinos can be well accounted for\nin this scenario, at the tree level. We also analyze the mixing in the chargino\nand the Higgs sector and calculate the decays of the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle in this model. The decay branching ratios show certain correlations\nwith the neutrino mixing angles, which can be tested at the LHC. Some other\nphenomenological implications of such a model have been discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2008 15:41:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2009 14:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}
