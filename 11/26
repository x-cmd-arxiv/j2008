At present, the bispectrum and trispectrum of the density\nperturbations have not been observed and the probability distribution for these\nperturbations is consistent with Gaussianity. However, Planck satellite data\nwill bring a new level of precision to bear on this issue, and it is possible\nthat evidence for non-Gaussian effects in the primordial distribution will be\ndiscovered. One possibility is that a trispectrum will be observed without\nevidence for a non-zero bispectrum. It is not difficult for this to occur in\ninflationary models where quantum fluctuations in a field other than the\ninflaton contribute to the density perturbations. A natural question to ask is\nwhether such an observation would rule out the standard scenarios. We explore\nthis issue and find that it is possible to construct single-field models in\nwhich inflaton-generated primordial density perturbations have an observable\ntrispectrum, but a bispectrum that is too small to be observed by the Planck\nsatellite. However, an awkward fine tuning seems to be unavoidable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2008 19:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 20:58:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2010 04:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-03"}

General relativistic models are\nmostly based on a dark energy field with fine-tuned, unnatural properties.\nThere is a great variety of models, but all share one feature in common -- an\ninability to account for the gravitational properties of the vacuum energy, and\na failure to solve the so-called coincidence problem. Two broad alternatives to\ndark energy have emerged as candidate models: these typically address only the\ncoincidence problem and not the vacuum energy problem. The first is based on\ngeneral relativity and attempts to describe the acceleration as an effect of\ninhomogeneity in the universe. If this alternative could be shown to work, then\nit would provide a dramatic resolution of the coincidence problem; however, a\nconvincing demonstration of viability has not yet emerged. The second\nalternative is based on infra-red modifications to general relativity, leading\nto a weakening of gravity on the largest scales and thus to acceleration. Most\nexamples investigated so far are scalar-tensor or brane-world models, and we\nfocus on the simplest candidates of each type: $f(R)$ models and DGP models\nrespectively. Both of these provide a new angle on the problem, but they also\nface serious difficulties. However, investigation of these models does lead to\nvaluable insights into the properties of gravity and structure formation, and\nit also leads to new strategies for testing the validity of General Relativity\nitself on cosmological scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2008 16:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-22"}

The ``low-degree'' nature of\nthis folding operation was crucial to the list decoding algorithm. We show how\nsuch folding schemes conducive to list decoding arise out of the\nArtin-Frobenius automorphism at primes in Galois extensions. Using this\napproach, we construct new folded algebraic-geometric codes for list decoding\nbased on cyclotomic function fields with a cyclic Galois group. Such function\nfields are obtained by adjoining torsion points of the Carlitz action of an\nirreducible $M \\in \\F_q[T]$. The Reed-Solomon case corresponds to the simplest\nsuch extension (corresponding to the case $M=T$). In the general case, we need\nto descend to the fixed field of a suitable Galois subgroup in order to ensure\nthe existence of many degree one places that can be used for encoding.\n  Our methods shed new light on algebraic codes and their list decoding, and\nlead to new codes achieving list decoding capacity. Quantitatively, these codes\nprovide list decoding (and list recovery/soft decoding) guarantees similar to\nfolded Reed-Solomon codes but with an alphabet size that is only\npolylogarithmic in the block length.

The spectral\nmethod exploits the natural eigenfunctions of the master equation of\nbirth-death processes to solve for the joint distribution of modules within the\nnetwork, which then inform each other and facilitate calculation of the entire\njoint distribution. We illustrate the method on a ubiquitous case in nature:\nlinear regulatory cascades. The efficiency of the method makes possible\nnumerical optimization of the input and regulatory parameters, revealing design\nproperties of, e.g., the most informative cascades. We find, for threshold\nregulation, that a cascade of strong regulations converts a unimodal input to a\nbimodal output, that multimodal inputs are no more informative than bimodal\ninputs, and that a chain of up-regulations outperforms a chain of\ndown-regulations. We anticipate that this numerical approach may be useful for\nmodeling noise in a variety of small network topologies in biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2008 18:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-19"}

For nearly twenty years the\nlimitations imposed by computing power forced simulators to ignore some of the\nbasic requirements for modeling gravitational instability. One of the\nlimitations of most cosmological codes has been the use of a force softening\nlength that is much smaller than the typical inter-particle separation. This\nleads to departures from collisionless evolution that is desired in these\nsimulations. We propose a particle based method with an adaptive resolution\nwhere the force softening length is reduced in high density regions while\nensuring that it remains well above the local inter-particle separation. The\nmethod, called the Adaptive TreePM, is based on the TreePM code. We present the\nmathematical model and an implementation of this code, and demonstrate that the\nresults converge over a range of options for parameters introduced in\ngeneralizing the code from the TreePM code. We explicitly demonstrate\ncollisionless evolution in collapse of an oblique plane wave. We compare the\ncode with the fixed resolution TreePM code and also an implementation that\nmimics adaptive mesh refinement methods and comment on the agreement, and\ndisagreements in the results. We find that in most respects the ATreePM code\nperforms at least as well as the fixed resolution TreePM in highly over-dense\nregions, from clustering and number density of haloes, to internal dynamics of\nhaloes. We also show that the adaptive code is faster than the corresponding\nhigh resolution TreePM code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2008 05:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2009 11:41:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2009 11:06:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 May 2009 04:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-07"}

Finally, we show that the commanded increase\nin the substrate voltage from 0 to 6V on 2007 August 30 reduced the dark\ncurrent, enabling the collection of useful science data at higher CCD\ntemperature (up to -50C). We also briefly describe the plan to recalibrate the\nXRT response files at this new voltage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2008 08:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The effect is most clear for black hole\nbinaries in the low/hard X-ray state, which is prevalent at X-ray luminosities\nbelow ~1% Eddington. We do not find strong evidence for significant changes in\nline profiles across accretion state changes, but this is hampered by a lack of\ngood data at such times. The observed anti-correlation, highly significant for\nblack hole binaries, is only marginally so for neutron star systems, for which\nthere are far less data.

When keys are inserted or deleted, the B-tree is updated in $O(\\log_B\nN)$ I/Os, if we require the resulting changes to be committed to disk right\naway. Otherwise, the memory buffer can be used to buffer the recent updates,\nand changes can be written to disk in batches, which significantly lowers the\namortized update cost. A systematic way of batching up updates is to use the\nlogarithmic method, combined with fractional cascading, resulting in a dynamic\nB-tree that supports insertions in $O(\\frac{1}{B}\\log\\nm)$ I/Os and queries in\n$O(\\log\\nm + \\frac{K}{B})$ I/Os.

This approach scales in a\nfavourable way compared to systems where qubit loss is prevalent, and paves the\nway for enhanced precision in magnetic field sensing\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2008 15:56:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2009 01:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-26"}

Weak compaction was performed by controlled pressing of\nintroductory components Ag2O and PbO2.

Electric and magnetic properties appealing for an ambient\ntemperature superconductivity may be attributed to scattering processes\nindicated by tunnelling of Ag-Ag clusters between states localized on the point\ncontacts formed between adjacent particles.
