The\nradiation at $\\sim 5$ GHz is quite steady and optically thin, consisting on a\ndominant core plus an extended jet-like structure. There is a spectral turnover\naround 1 GHz, and evidence of variability at timescales of 1 yr at 234 MHz. We\ninvestigate the radio emitter properties using the available broadband radio\ndata, and assuming two possible scenarios to explain the turnover: free-free\nabsorption in the stellar wind, or synchrotron self-absorption. We use the\nrelationships between the turnover frequency, the stellar wind density, the\nemitter location, size and magnetic field, and the Lorentz factor of the\nemitting electrons, as well as a reasonable assumption on the energy budget, to\ninfer the properties of the low-frequency radio emitter. Also, we put this\ninformation in context with the broadband radio data. The location and size of\nthe low-frequency radio emitter can be restricted to $\\ga$ few AU from the\nprimary star, its magnetic field to $\\sim 3\\times 10^{-3}-1$ G, and the\nelectron Lorentz factors to $\\sim 10-100$.

In particular, two adaptive schemes are\ndiscussed and compared in the context of Boolean Networks and Threshold\nNetworks: 1) Active nodes loose links, frozen nodes aquire new links, 2) Nodes\nwith correlated activity connect, de-correlated nodes disconnect. These simple\nlocal adaptive rules lead to co-evolution of network topology and -dynamics.\nAdaptive networks are strikingly different from random networks: They evolve\ninhomogeneous topologies and broad plateaus of homeostatic regulation,\ndynamical activity exhibits $1/f$ noise and attractor periods obey a scale-free\ndistribution. The proposed co-evolutionary mechanism of topological\nself-organization is robust against noise and does not depend on the details of\ndynamical transition rules.

This was first observed within the\ncontext of the McLerran-Venugopalan model which has an x-independent saturation\nscale. The extremum arises due to the k_t-odd nature of the polarization\ndependent fragmentation function, which probes approximately the derivative of\nthe dipole scattering amplitude. The amplitude changes most strongly around the\nsaturation scale, resulting in a peak in the polarization. We find that the\nobservation also extends to the more realistic case in which the saturation\nscale Q_s is x dependent. Since a range of x and therefore Q_s values is probed\nat a given transverse momentum and rapidity, this result is a priori not\nexpected. Moreover, the measurement of Lambda polarization over a range of x_F\nvalues actually provides a direct probe of the x dependence of the saturation\nscale. This novel feature is demonstrated for typical LHC kinematics and for\nseveral phenomenological models of the dipole scattering amplitude. We show\nthat although the measurement will be challenging, it may be feasible at LHC.\nThe situation at RHIC is not favorable, because the peak will likely be at too\nlow transverse momentum of the Lambda to be a trustworthy measure of the\nsaturation scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2008 17:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-30"}

We repeat the previous\nhydrodynamical star cluster formation simulations of Bate et al., and Bate &\nBonnell, but we use a realistic gas equation of state and radiative transfer in\nthe flux-limited diffusion approximation rather than the original barotropic\nequation of state.\n  Whereas star formation in the barotropic simulations continued unabated until\nthe simulation was stopped, we find that radiative feedback essentially\nterminates the production of new objects after roughly one local dynamical\ntime. Radiative feedback also dramatically decreases the propensity of massive\ncircumstellar discs to fragment and inhibits fragmentation of other dense gas\n(e.g. filaments) close to existing protostellar objects. These two effects\ndecrease the numbers of protostars formed by a factor of approximately 4.\nWhereas the original simulations produced more brown dwarfs than stars, the\nradiative feedback results in a ratio of stars to brown dwarfs of approximately\n5:1, in much better agreement with observations. Most importantly, we find that\nalthough the characteristic stellar mass in the original calculations scaled\nlinearly with the initial mean Jeans mass, when radiative feedback is included\nthe characteristic stellar mass is indistinguishable for the two calculations.\nWe thus propose that the reason the observed initial mass function appears to\nbe universal is due to self-regulation of the star formation process by\nradiative feedback.

The first paradox concerns the\napparent non-existence of the signature of the electron pockets in angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The second paradox is a clear\nsignature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no\nevidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the\nfrequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these\napparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address\nthe first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to\ncorrelated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the\nmaterials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral\nfunction is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate\nrange of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the hole\npocket is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer\nmatrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder\naffects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket. However,\nwhen, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included,\nit wipes out the frequency corresponding to the hole pocket. Thus, if we are\ncorrect, it will be necessary to do measurements at higher magnetic fields and\neven higher quality samples to recover the hole pocket frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2008 22:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2009 22:06:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 May 2009 21:32:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 20:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-06"}

Two types of\ncorrections are considered: those which are due to the nonzero thickness of\nsuch devices (geometrical effects) and those relating to the scattering of beam\nparticles off their material. The application of these two types of corrections\nis greatly facilitated by decomposing the physical effects (i.e., the\ncontribution to the fluence) of two-dimensional objects (i.e., of the apertures\nof the devices) into one-dimensional, easily-calculable contributions. To\nminimise the time requirements in the derivation of the scattering corrections,\na two-step process is introduced. The first step occurs at beam-configuration\nphase and comprises the analysis of half-block fluence measurements and the\nextraction of the one parameter of the model which is used in the description\nof the beamline characteristics; subsequently, a number of Monte-Carlo runs\nlead to the determination of the parameters of a convenient parameterisation of\nthe relevant fluence contributions. The second step involves (at planning time)\nthe reconstruction of the parameters (which are used in the description of the\nscattering contributions) via simple interpolations, performed on the results\nobtained during the beam-configuration phase. It is shown that the inclusion of\nthe scattering effects leads to substantial improvement in the reproduction of\nthe experimental data.

The star's torsional oscillation modulates this wind emission\nconsiderably when it is odd and of sufficient amplitude, which is relatively\neasy to reach. Odd oscillations may occur just after the formation of a quark\nstar. Other asymmetries can cause similar effects. The buoyancy of wound-up\nmagnetic fields is inhibited, or its effects are limited, by a variety of\ndifferent mechanisms. Direct electromagnetic emission by the torsional\noscillation in either an outside vacuum or the leptonic wind surrounding the\ncompact object is found to be insignificant. In contrast, the twist given to\nthe outer magnetic field by an odd torsional oscillation is generally\nsufficient to open the star's magnetosphere. The Poynting emission of the star\nin its leptonic environment is then radiated from all of its surface and is\nenhanced considerably during these open episodes, tapping at the bulk\nrotational energy of the star.

Recent near-IR observations show that lopsidedness is\ncommon. The stellar disks in nearly 30 % of galaxies have significant\nlopsidedness, greater than 10 % measured as the Fourier amplitude of the m=1\ncomponent normalized to the average value. This asymmetry is traced\nparticularly well by the atomic hydrogen gas distribution lying in the outer\nparts. The lopsidedness also occurs in the nuclear regions, where the nucleus\nis offset with respect to the outer isophotes. The galaxies in a group\nenvironment show higher lopsidedness. The origin of lopsidedness could be due\nto the disk response to a tidally distorted halo, or via gas accretion. The\nlopsidedness has a large impact on the dynamics of the galaxy, its evolution,\nthe star formation in it, and on the growth of the central black hole and on\nthe nuclear fueling, merging of binary black holes etc. The disk lopsidedness\ncan be used as a diagnostic to study the halo asymmetry.

The question whether the physics of the\ninsulating low-temperature phase is dominated by the Mott or the Peierls\nscenario, i.e. by correlation or band effects, is still under debate. A recent\ncluster dynamical mean field theory calculation [Biermann et al, Phys.

Their rich\nstructure allows for explicit calculations in several situations and makes them\na natural object to start with if one wants to study more general stochastic\nflows. Often the intuition gained by understanding the problem in the context\nof IBFs transfers to more general situations. However, the obvious link between\nstochastic flows, random dynamical systems and ergodic theory cannot be\nexploited in its full strength as the IBF does not have an invariant\nprobability measure but rather an infinite one.

The imposed linear drift destroys the translation invariance of the\nIBF, but many other important structure properties like the Markov property of\nthe distance process remain valid and allow for explicit calculations in\ncertain situations. The fact that isotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flows have\ninvariant probability measures allows one to apply techniques from random\ndynamical systems theory.

The theory is used to estimate the crystallization time in a\nKob-Andersen mixture from the crystallization time in a series of relared\nsystems. At T=0.40 we estimate this time to be 5$\\times 10^{7}$ time units\n($\\approx 1. ms$). A new binary Lennard-Jones mixture is proposed that is not\nprone to crystallization and faster to simulate than the two standard binary\nLennard-Jones mixtures; this is obtained by removing the like-particle\nattractions by switching to Weeks-Chandler-Andersen type potentials, while\nmaintaining the unlike-particle attraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2008 14:04:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 15:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-01"}

These electron properties are compared with those\npredicted by the standard treatments using running waves (Bloch states)\nresulting from the cyclic boundary conditions (CBCs). It is shown that, while\nthe total number of eigenenergies in a miniband is the same according to both\ntreatments, the number of different energies is twice higher according to the\nFBCs. It is also shown that the wave vector values corresponding to the\neigenenergies are spaced twice as densely for the FBCs as for the CBCs. The\nreason is that a running wave is characterized by a single value of wave vector\nk, while a standing wave in a finite SL is characterized by a pair of\nwavevectors +/- q.

The current outburst is the first one since 1998 and the derived\nluminosity is 1.1-2.6x10^36 erg s-1 in the 20-100 keV energy range. This low\noutburst luminosity and the long-term time-average accretion rate of\n~5x10^-12Msolar/yr suggest that SAXJ 1810.8-2609 is a faint soft X-ray\ntransient. During the flux increase, spectra are consistent with a thermal\nComptonization model with a temperature plasma of ~23-30 keV and an optical\ndepth of ~1.2-1.5, independent from luminosity of the system. This is a typical\nlow hard spectral state for which the X-ray emission is attributed to the\nupscattering of soft seed photons by a hot, optically thin electron plasma.\nDuring the decay, spectra have a different shape, the high energy tail being\ncompatible with a single power law. This confirm similar behavior observed by\nBeppoSAX during the previous outburst, with absence of visible cutoff in the\nhard X-ray spectrum.

The primary energy release in solar flares is almost certainly due\nto magnetic reconnection, making this a strong candidate as a mechanism for\nparticle acceleration. While particle acceleration in 2D geometries has been\nwidely studied, investigations in 3D are a recent development. Two main classes\nof reconnection regimes at a 3D magnetic null point have been identified: fan\nand spine reconnection Aims. Here we investigate particle trajectories and\nacceleration during reconnection at a 3D null point, using a test particle\nnumerical code, and compare the efficiency of the fan and spine regimes in\ngenerating an energetic particle population. Methods. We calculated the time\nevolution of the energy spectra. We discuss the geometry of particle escape\nfrom the two configurations and characterise the trapped and escaped\npopulations. Results. We find that fan reconnection is less efficent than spine\nreconnection in providing seed particles to the region of strong electric field\nwhere acceleration is possible. The establishment of a steady-state spectrum\nrequires approximately double the time in fan reconnection. The steady-state\nenergy spectrum at intermediate energies (protons 1 keV to 0.1 MeV) is\ncomparable in the fan and spine regimes. While in spine reconnection particle\nescape takes place in two symmetric jets along the spine, in fan reconnection\nno jets are produced and particles escape in the fan plane, in a ribbon-like\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2008 13:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Our model-independent measurements of $E$\nand $S$ enable a precision study of the finite temperature thermodynamics. The\n$E(S)$ data are directly compared to several recent predictions. The\ntemperature in both the superfluid and normal fluid regime is obtained from the\nfundamental thermodynamic relation $T=\\partial E/\\partial S$ by parameterizing\nthe $E(S)$ data. Our $E(S)$ data are also used to experimentally calibrate the\nendpoint temperatures obtained for adiabatic sweeps of the magnetic field\nbetween the ideal and strongly interacting regimes. This enables the first\nexperimental calibration of the temperature scale used in experiments on\nfermionic pair condensation. Our calibration shows that the ideal gas\ntemperature measured for the onset of pair condensation corresponds closely to\nthe critical temperature estimated in the strongly interacting regime from the\nfits to our $E(S)$ data. The results are in very good agreement with recent\npredictions. Finally, using universal thermodynamic relations, we estimate the\nchemical potential and heat capacity of the trapped gas from the $E(S)$ data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2008 15:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nassociation of several events with the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A supports\nthe paradigm that UHECRs are powered by supermassive black-hole engines and\naccelerated to ultra-high energies in the shocks formed by variable plasma\nwinds in the inner jets of radio galaxies. The GZK horizon length of 75 EeV\nUHECR protons is ~100 Mpc, so that the Auger results are consistent with an\nassumed proton composition of the UHECRs. In this scenario, the sources of\nUHECRs are FR II radio galaxies and FR I galaxies like Cen A with scattered\nradiation fields that enhance UHECR neutral-beam production. Radio galaxies\nwith jets pointed away from us can still be observed as UHECR sources due to\ndeflection of UHECRs by magnetic fields in the radio lobes of these galaxies.

By direct comparison, we find\nthat the trapping efficiency only weakly depends on the MOT cell size. It is\nalso found that the trapping efficiency of the MOT with the smallest cell,\nwhose diameter is equal to the diameter of the trapping beams, is about 40%\nsmaller than the efficiency of larger cells. Furthermore, we also demonstrate\nthe importance of two factors: a long coated tube at the entrance of the MOT\ncell, used instead of a diaphragm; and the passivation with an alkali vapor of\nthe coating on the cell walls, in order to minimize the losses of trappable\natoms. These results guided us in the construction of an efficient\nlarge-diameter cell, which has been successfully employed for on-line trapping\nof Fr isotopes at INFN's national laboratories in Legnaro, Italy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2008 15:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

These are the initial results (obtained\nduring the period 2007-2008) from a long term photometric and spectroscopic\nprogram aimed to study the variability in the accretion processes of pre-Main\nSequence (PMS) stars, by correlating the continuum fluctuations with the\nspectroscopical properties. Eight sources have been observed in different\nepochs, for a total of 25 acquired spectra. EXor spectra show a wide variety of\nemission features dominated by HI recombination (Paschen and Brackett series).\nWe have investigated whether line and continuum variability could be due to a\nvariable extinction, but such hypothesis is applicable only to the peculiar\nsource PV Cep. By comparing the observed spectra with a wind model, mass loss\nrates in the range (2-10)x10^(-8) M_sun} yr^(-1) are derived, along with other\nwind parameters. Consistent results are also obtained by assuming that HI lines\nare due to accretion. CO overtone is also detected in the majority of the\nsources both in absorption and in emission. It appears to come from regions\nmore compact than winds, likely the stellar photosphere (when in absorption)\nand the circumstellar disk (when in emission). NaI and CaI IR lines behave as\nthe CO does, thus they are thought to arise in the same locations. For some\ntargets multiple spectra correspond to different activity stages of the source.\nThose exhibiting the largest continuum variation at 2um (DeltaK > 1 mag)\npresent a significant line flux fading during the continuum declining phases.\nIn particular, CO absorption (emission) appears associated to inactive (active)\nstages, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2008 15:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
