The model is simple, adaptable to other debris\ndisks, and can be extended to accommodate multiple planets. If Fom b is the\ndominant perturber of the belt, then to produce the observed disk morphology it\nmust have a mass < 3 Jupiter masses. If the belt and planet orbits are\napsidally aligned, our model predicts a planet mass of 0.5 Jupiter masses. The\ninner edge of the debris disk at 133 AU lies at the periphery of Fom b's\nchaotic zone, and the mean disk eccentricity of 0.11 is secularly forced by the\nplanet, supporting predictions made prior to the discovery of Fom b. However,\nprevious mass constraints based on disk morphology rely on several\noversimplifications. We explain why our constraint is more reliable. It is\nbased on a global model of the disk that is not restricted to the planet's\nchaotic zone boundary. Moreover, we screen disk parent bodies for dynamical\nstability over the system age of 100 Myr, and model them separately from their\ndust grain progeny; the latter's orbits are strongly affected by radiation\npressure and their lifetimes are limited to 0.1 Myr by destructive grain-grain\ncollisions. The single planet model predicts that planet and disk orbits be\napsidally aligned. Fom b's nominal space velocity does not bear this out, but\nthe astrometric uncertainties may be large. If the apsidal misalignment is\nreal, our upper mass limit of 3 Jupiter masses still holds. The belt contains\nat least 3 Earth masses of solids that are grinding down to dust. Such a large\nmass in solids is consistent with Fom b having formed in situ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2008 18:23:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 06:52:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 05:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We present a continuation of our study about the relation between\nstellar mass and gas-phase metallicity in the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS).

For a selected sample of emission-line galaxies, we use both\ndiagnostic diagrams and empirical calibrations based on [OII] emission lines\nalong with the empirical relation between the intensities of the [OIII] and\n[NeIII] emission lines and the theoretical ratios between Balmer recombination\nemission lines to identify star-forming galaxies and to derive their\nmetallicities.

These\nnew methods allow us to extend the mass-metallicity relation to higher\nredshift. We show that the metallicity determinations are consistent with more\nestablished strong-line methods. Taken together this allows us to study the\nevolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z = 1.24 with good control of\nsystematic uncertainties. We find an evolution with redshift of the average\nmetallicity of galaxies very similar to those reported in the literature: for a\ngiven stellar mass, galaxies at z = 1 have, on average, a metallicity = 0.3 dex\nlower than galaxies in the local universe.

In this paper, we\nstudy the connection between self-acceleration and the presence of ghosts for a\nquite generic class of theories that modify gravity in the infrared.

This method, which represents a\ndevelopment of the geometrical deprojection technique presented in Ameglio et\nal. (2007), implements the solution of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. In\norder to quantify the efficiency of our mass reconstructions, we apply our\ntechnique to a set of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. We propose\ntwo versions of our method of mass reconstruction. Method 1 is completely\nmodel-independent, while Method 2 assumes instead the analytic mass profile\nproposed by Navarro et al. (1997) (NFW). We find that the main source of bias\nin recovering the mass profiles is due to deviations from hydrostatic\nequilibrium, which cause an underestimate of the mass of about 10 per cent at\nr_500 and up to 20 per cent at the virial radius. Method 1 provides a\nreconstructed mass which is biased low by about 10 per cent, with a 20 per cent\nscatter, with respect to the true mass profiles. Method 2 proves to be more\nstable, reducing the scatter to 10 per cent, but with a larger bias of 20 per\ncent, mainly induced by the deviations from equilibrium in the outskirts. To\nbetter understand the results of Method 2, we check how well it allows to\nrecover the relation between mass and concentration parameter. When analyzing\nthe 3D mass profiles we find that including in the fit the inner 5 per cent of\nthe virial radius biases high the halo concentration. Also, at a fixed mass,\nhotter clusters tend to have larger concentration. Our procedure recovers the\nconcentration parameter essentially unbiased but with a scatter of about 50 per\ncent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2008 19:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The origin of this kind of systems is still not well understood.\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate whether the different locations of\ndwarf galaxies with respect to ellipticals in the face-on view of the\nfundamental plane could be due to the transformation of bright disc galaxies in\nlow-mass systems by harassment. We have run high-resolution N-body numerical\nsimulations to test the tidal stripping scenario of the dE galaxies. The\npresent simulations modelled several individual tidal stripping events on\ninitial disc-like galaxy models with different bulge-to-disc mass ratios. Tidal\nstripping is a very efficient mechanism for removing stars and dark matter\nparticles from galaxies. The particles of the disc and halo components were\neasily stripped, while the bulge not. Thus, the scale length of the discs were\n40-50% shorter than the initial ones. Prograde tidal interactions create tidal\nfeatures like stable bars in the discs of the galaxies. After several tidal\ninteractions the galaxy remnants looks like a dwarf spheroidal system.\nSimulated galaxies with initial large B/D ratios are closer to the face-on view\nof the fundamental plane defined by bright E and bulges of early-type galaxies.\nNevertheless, galaxies with initial small B/D ratio are located, after four\nfast tidal encounters, at the position of dE galaxies in the face-on view of\nthe fundamental plane. We conclude that fast galaxy-galaxy interactions are\nefficient mechanisms for transforming bright galaxies in dwarf ones. Indeed,\nthe different location observed between Es and dEs in the face-on view of the\nfundamental plane can be explained by the formation of dwarf galaxies by\nharassment of late-type bright ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2008 21:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The cost function to be minimized is derived from discretizing the\nfluid's kinetic energy.

In particular, the\ntime-scales for the enrichment by SNe II and SNe Ia are crucial in interpreting\nthe evolution of abundance ratios such as [alpha/Fe]. In fact, the\nalpha-elements are produced mainly by SNe II on time-scales of the order of 3\nto 30 Myr, whereas the Fe is mainly produced by SNe Ia on a larger range of\ntime-scales, going from 30 Myr to a Hubble time. This produces differences in\nthe [alpha/Fe] ratios at high and low redshift and it is known as \"time-delay\"\nmodel. In this talk we review the most common progenitor models for SNe Ia and\nthe derived rates together with the effect of the star formation history on the\n[alpha/Fe] versus [Fe/H] diagram in the Galaxy. From these diagrams we can\nderive the timescale for the formation of the inner halo (roughly 2 Gyr), the\ntimescale for the formation of the local disk (roughly 7-8 Gyr) as well the\ntime-scales for the formation of the whole disk. These are functions of the\ngalactocentric distance and vary from 2-3 Gyr in the inner disk up to a Hubble\ntime in the outer disk (inside-out formation). Finally, the timescale for the\nformation of the bulge is found to be no longer than 0.3 Gyr, similar to the\ntimescale for the formation of larger spheroids such as elliptical galaxies. We\nshow the time-delay model applied to galaxies of different morphological type,\nidentified by different star formation histories, and how it constrains\ndiffering galaxy formation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2008 02:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The measured\nsynchrotron flux is a function of the aspect angle between interstellar\nmagnetic field (ISMF) and the line of sight. Thus a model of non-thermal\nemission from SNRs should account for the orientation of the ambient magnetic\nfield. We develop a new method for the estimation of the aspect angle, based on\nthe comparison between observed and synthesized radio maps of SNRs, making\ndifferent assumptions about the dependence of electron injection efficiency on\nthe shock obliquity. The method uses the azimuthal profile of radio surface\nbrightness as a probe for orientation of ambient magnetic field because it is\nalmost insensitive to the downstream distribution of magnetic field and\nemitting electrons. We apply our method to a new radio image of SN 1006\nproduced on the basis of archival VLA and Parkes data. The image recovers\nemission from all spatial structures with angular scales from few arcseconds to\n15 arcmin.

The stellar\nkinematics reveals: (1) a distorted rotation pattern in the radial velocity\nfield with kinematic center apparently displaced from the nuclear source by a\nfew tens of parsecs; (2) a high velocity dispersion in the bulge of sigma=170\nkm/s; (3) a partial ring of sigma=50 km/s interpreted as due to stars formed\nfrom cold gas in a previous burst of star formation. The kinematics of the\nionized gas shows an additional blueshifted component with velocities > 100\nkm/s interpreted as due to an outflow along the ionization cone. The mass\noutflow rate in the ionized gas was estimated as ~0.05 M_Sun/yr, which is one\norder of magnitude larger than the accretion rate to the AGN. The flux\ndistribution and kinematics of the hot molecular gas, traced by the H2l2.22um\nemission line, suggests that most of this gas is in the galactic plane. An\nexcess blueshift along PA~-70 can be interpreted as an inflow towards the\nnucleus. An AGN-Starburst connection in the nucleus of NGC7582 is supported by\nthe ratio between the mass accretion rate and the star formation rate in the\ncircumnuclear region of ~0.26%, which is close to the Magorrian relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2008 12:29:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2008 11:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this paper, we present a bond percolation model\nof multitype networks with an arbitrary joint degree distribution that allows\nheterogeneity in the edge occupation probability. As previously demonstrated,\nthe multitype approach allows many non-trivial mixing patterns such as\nassortativity and clustering between nodes. We derive a number of useful\nstatistical properties of multitype networks as well as a general phase\ntransition criterion. We also demonstrate that a number of previous models\nbased on probability generating functions are special cases of the proposed\nformalism.

The Coulomb matrix is a central\ningredient in implementations of many-body perturbation theory, such as the\nHartree-Fock and GW approximations for the electronic self-energy or the\nrandom-phase approximation for the dielectric function. It is represented in\nthe mixed product basis, which combines numerical muffin-tin functions and\ninterstitial plane waves that are here expanded with the Rayleigh formula. The\nresulting algorithm is very efficient in terms of both computational cost and\naccuracy and is superior to an implementation with the Fourier transform of the\nstep function. In order to allow an analytic treatment of the divergence at k=0\nin reciprocal space, we expand the Coulomb matrix analytically around this\npoint without resorting to a projection onto plane waves. We then apply a basis\ntransformation that diagonalizes the Coulomb matrix and confines the divergence\nto a single eigenvalue. At the same time, response matrices like the dielectric\nfunction separate into head, wings, and body with the same mathematical\nproperties as in a plane-wave basis. As an illustration we apply the formulas\nto electron-energy-loss spectra for nickel at different k vectors including\nk=0. The convergence of the spectra towards the result at k=0 is clearly seen.\nOur treatment also allows to include transitions from core states that give\nrise to a shallow peak at high energies and lead to good agreement with\nexperiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2008 15:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-01"}
