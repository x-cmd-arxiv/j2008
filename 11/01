The thermal relic abundance matches cosmology, while nuclear recoil\ndirect detection bounds are automatically avoided in the absence of (large)\ncouplings to quarks. The annihilation cross section in the early Universe is\nthe same as the annihilation in our galactic neighborhood. This allows Dirac\nfermion dark matter to naturally explain the positron ratio excess observed by\nPAMELA with a minimal boost factor, given present astrophysical uncertainties.\nWe use the Galprop program for propagation of signal and background; we discuss\nin detail the uncertainties resulting from the propagation parameters and, more\nimportantly, the injected spectra. Fermi/GLAST has an opportunity to see a\nfeature in the gamma-ray spectrum at the mass of the Dirac fermion. The excess\nobserved by ATIC/PPB-BETS may also be explained with Dirac dark matter that is\nheavy. A supersymmetric model with a Dirac bino provides a viable UV model of\nthe effective theory. The dominance of the leptonic operators, and thus the\nobservation of an excess in positrons and not in anti-protons, is naturally\nexplained by the large hypercharge and low mass of sleptons as compared with\nsquarks. Minimizing the boost factor implies the right-handed selectron is the\nlightest slepton, which is characteristic of our model. Selectrons (or\nsleptons) with mass less than a few hundred GeV are an inescapable consequence\nawaiting discovery at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 19:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-28"}

We also derive conditions\non the B-field and the metric, which when satisfied, the leading UV divergence\nwill become linear, and can be cancelled out by choosing the boundary condition\nof the string appropriately. Our results, together with the recent result of\narXiv:0807.5127, where the effect of a nontrivial dilaton on the structure of\nUV divergences in Wilson loop is analysed, allow us to conclude that Legendre\ntransform is at best capable of cancelling the linear UV divergences arising\nfrom the area of the worldsheet, but is incapable to handle the divergences\nassociated with the dilaton or the B-field in general. We also solve the\nconditions for the cancellation of the leading linear divergences generally and\nfind that many well-known supergravity backgrounds are of these kinds,\nincluding examples such as the Sakai-Sugimoto QCD model or N=1 duality with\nSasaki-Einstein spaces. We also point out that Wilson loop in the\nKlebanov-Strassler background have a divergence associated with the B-field\nwhich cannot be cancelled away with the Legendre transform. Finally we end with\nsome comments on the form of the Wilson loop operator in the ABJM\nsuperconformal Chern-Simons theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 16:29:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2008 11:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-16"}

A broad-band excitation seems the\nnatural choice to drive the series of excitation and deexcitation steps\nrequired to form a molecule in its vibronic ground state from two scattering\natoms. First attempts at femtosecond photoassociation were, however, hampered\nby the requirement to eliminate the atomic excitation leading to trap\ndepletion. On the other hand, molecular levels very close to the atomic\ntransition are to be excited. The broad bandwidth of a femtosecond laser then\nappears to be rather an obstacle. To overcome the ostensible conflict of\ndriving a narrow transition by a broad-band laser, we suggest a two-photon\nphotoassociation scheme. In the weak-field regime, a spectral phase pattern can\nbe employed to eliminate the atomic line. When the excitation is carried out by\nmore than one photon, different pathways in the field can be interfered\nconstructively or destructively. In the strong-field regime, a temporal phase\ncan be applied to control dynamic Stark shifts. The atomic transition is\nsuppressed by choosing a phase which keeps the levels out of resonance. We\nderive analytical solutions for atomic two-photon dark states in both the\nweak-field and strong-field regime. Two-photon excitation may thus pave the way\ntoward coherent control of photoassociation. Ultimately, the success of such a\nscheme will depend on the details of the excited electronic states and\ntransition dipole moments. We explore the possibility of two-photon femtosecond\nphotoassociation for alkali and alkaline-earth metal dimers and present a\ndetailed study for the example of calcium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 17:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-21"}

Integrating any single set\nof orbital elements inadequately describes the full range of secular evolutions\nconsistent with current observations. Thus, we combine radial velocity\nobservations of HD 12661 with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to generate\nensembles of initial conditions for direct n-body integrations. We find that\nany mean motion resonances are quite weak and do not significantly impact the\nsecular evolution, and that current observations indicate circulation or large\namplitude libration of the periapses. The eccentricity of the outer planet\nundergoes large oscillations for nearly all of the allowed two-planet orbital\nsolutions. This type of secular evolution would arise if planet c had been\nimpulsively perturbed, perhaps due to strong scattering of an additional planet\nthat was subsequently accreted onto the star. Finally, we note that the secular\nevolution implied by the current orbital configuration implies that planet c\nspends ~96% of the time following an orbit more eccentric than that presently\nobserved.

Randomly distributed, clustered SNe explosions cause\nthe formation of hot superbubbles that drive either galactic fountains or\nsupersonic winds out of the galactic disk. In a galactic fountain, the ejected\ngas is re-captured by the gravitational potential and falls back onto the disk.\n  From 3D non-equilibrium radiative cooling hydrodynamical simulations of these\nfountains, we find that they may reach altitudes smaller than 5 kpc in the halo\nand hence explain the formation of the so-called intermediate-velocity-clouds\n(IVCs). On the other hand, the high-velocity-clouds (HVCs) that are observed at\nhigher altitudes (of up to 12 kpc) require another mechanism to explain their\nproduction. We argue that they could be formed either by the capture of gas\nfrom the intergalactic medium and/or by the action of magnetic fields that are\ncarried out to the halo with the gas in the fountains. Due to angular momentum\nlosses (of 10-15%) to the halo, we find that the fountain material falls back\nto smaller radii and is not largely spread over the galactic disk, as\npreviously expected. This result is consistent with the metal distribution\nderived from recent chemical models of the galaxy.

Quark-Novae are\npredicted to arise from the explosive collapse (and conversion) of sufficiently\nmassive neutron stars into quark stars. A Quark-Nova (QN) can occur over a\nrange of time scales following the supernova event. For QNe that arise days to\nweeks after the supernovae, we show that dual-shock that arises as the QN\nejecta encounter the supernova ejecta can produce enough photons to reionize\nhydrogen in most of the Inter-Galactic medium (IGM) by z ~ 6. Such events can\nexplain the large optical depth tau_e ~ 0.1 as measured by WMAP, if the\nclumping factor, C, of the material being ionized is smaller than 10. We\nsuggest a way in which a normal initial mass function (IMF) for the oldest\nstars can be reconciled with a large optical depth as well as the mean\nmetallicity of the early IGM post reionization. We find that QN also make a\ncontribution to r-process element abundances for atomic numbers A > 130. We\npredict that the main cosmological signatures of Quark-Novae are the gamma-ray\nbursts that announce their birth. These will be clustered at redshifts in the\nrange z ~ 7-8 in our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 23:47:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2008 19:07:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 02:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

This paper\ndiscusses how a foresighted user can acquire this knowledge by modeling its\nexperienced interference as a function of its own power allocation. To\ncharacterize the outcome of the multi-user interaction, the conjectural\nequilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibrium for the\ninvestigated water-filling game is proved. Interestingly, both the Nash\nequilibrium and the Stackelberg equilibrium are shown to be special cases of\nthe generalization of conjectural equilibrium. We develop practical algorithms\nto form accurate beliefs and search desirable power allocation strategies.\nNumerical simulations indicate that a foresighted user without any a priori\nknowledge of its competitors' private information can effectively learn the\nrequired information, and induce the entire system to an operating point that\nimproves both its own achievable rate as well as the rates of the other\nparticipants in the water-filling game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 23:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-04"}

This paper describes an application of\nPSO to the problem of designing a fractional-order\nproportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller whose parameters comprise\nproportionality constant, integral constant, derivative constant, integral\norder (lambda) and derivative order (delta). The presence of five optimizable\nparameters makes the task of designing a FOPID controller more challenging than\nconventional PID controller design. Our design method focuses on minimizing the\nIntegral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) criterion. The digital realization of the\ndeigned system utilizes the Tustin operator-based continued fraction expansion\nscheme. We carry out a simulation that illustrates the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach especially for realizing fractional-order plants. This paper\nalso attempts to study the behavior of fractional PID controller vis-a-vis that\nof its integer order counterpart and demonstrates the superiority of the former\nto the latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 2008 10:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-04"}
