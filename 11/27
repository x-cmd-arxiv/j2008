Building upon previous work based\non the Gaussian case, we show that, expressed in terms of suitable variables,\nthe mass function of friends-of-friends haloes is approximately universal (i.e.\nindependent of redshift, cosmology, and matter transfer function) to good\nprecision (nearly 10 per cent) also in non-Gaussian scenarios. We provide\nfitting formulae for the high-mass end (M>10^13 M_sol/h) of the universal mass\nfunction in terms of F_NL, and we also present a non-universal fit in terms of\nboth F_NL and z to be used for applications requiring higher accuracy. In the\nGaussian case, we extend our fit to a wider range of halo masses (M>2.4 x 10^10\nM_sol/h) and we also provide a consistent fit of the linear halo bias. We show\nthat, for realistic values of F_NL, the matter power-spectrum in non-Gaussian\ncosmologies departs from the Gaussian one by up to 2 per cent on the scales\nwhere the baryonic- oscillation features are imprinted on the 2-point\nstatistics. We confirm the strong k-dependence of the halo bias on large scales\n(k<0.05 h Mpc^-1) which was already detected in previous studies. However, we\nfind that commonly used parameterisations based on the peak-background split do\nnot provide an accurate description of our simulations which present extra\ndependencies on the wavenumber, the non-linearity parameter and, possibly, the\nclustering strength. We provide an accurate fit of the simulation data that can\nbe used as a benchmark for future determinations of F_NL with galaxy surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2008 17:24:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2008 17:35:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 17:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We simulate the\nevolution of low-mass protoplanetary swarms in three dimensions. The aim is to\nexamine both protoplanet survival rates and the dynamical structure of the\nresulting planetary systems, and to compare them with 2D simulations. We\npresent results from a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of eight protoplanets\nembedded in a protoplanetary disc. We also present a suite of simulations\nperformed using an N-body code, modified to include prescriptions for planetary\nmigration and for eccentricity and inclination damping. These prescriptions\nwere obtained by fitting analytic formulae to hydrodynamic simulations of\nplanets embedded in discs with initially eccentric and/or inclined orbits. As\nwas found in two dimensions, differential migration produces groups of\nprotoplanets in stable, multiple mean-motion resonances that migrate in\nlockstep, preventing prolonged periods of gravitational scattering. In almost\nall simulations, this leads to large-scale migration of the protoplanet swarm\ninto the central star in the absence of a viable stopping mechanism. The\nevolution involves mutual collisions, occasional instances of large-scale\nscattering, and the frequent formation of the long-lived, co-orbital planet\nsystems that arise in > 30% of all runs. Disc-induced damping overwhelms\neccentricity and inclination growth due to planet-planet interactions.\nCo-orbital planets are a natural outcome of dynamical relaxation in a strongly\ndissipative environment, and if observed in nature would imply that such a\nperiod of evolution commonly arises during planetary formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2008 17:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

In this\nscheme, the entire time domain is divided into several sub-domains, and a\nfractional derivative (FDs) at a time node point is approximated using a\nmodified Gr\\\"{u}nwald-Letnikov approach. For the first order derivative, the\nproposed modified Gr\\\"{u}nwald-Letnikov definition leads to a central\ndifference scheme. When the approximations are substituted into the Fractional\nOptimal Control (FCO) equations, it leads to a set of algebraic equations which\nare solved using a direct numerical technique. Two examples, one time-invariant\nand the other time-variant, are considered to study the performance of the\nnumerical scheme. Results show that 1) as the order of the derivative\napproaches an integer value, these formulations lead to solutions for integer\norder system, and 2) as the sizes of the sub-domains are reduced, the solutions\nconverge.

This is attributed to highly efficient conversion of\nacetylene to C2H due to the enhanced electron density compared to a standard\ncapacitive plasma where the acetylene (neutral and ion) species remain\ndominant. This conversion may be crucial to film formation via inert rather\nthan hydrocarbon ion bombardment. In addition, the transient formation of CH4\nfrom acetylene has been discovered using IR absorption spectroscopy with time\nconstants similar to observed pressure variations. Rate coefficients and rates\nfor many of the reaction mechanisms, calculated using measured EEDFs and\nspecies densities, are given. These results have important application in\nplasma models and growth studies for hydrogenated amorphous or diamond-like\ncarbon film deposition.

At higher pressures, 120 mTorr, the bimodal structure is\nreplaced by a single peak. For all conditions, the dominant ion is Ar+ or ArH+\ndespite a set C2H2:Ar flow ratio of 2:1, and this can be attributed to the high\nelectron dissociation of the parent molecule.

Processes leading to\nthe suppression of star formation and morphological transformation are\nprevalent: this is particularly evident in the dramatic upturn in the fraction\nof S0-type galaxies in clusters. However, until now, the process and\nenvironment of formation has remained unidentified. We present a HST-based\nmorphological analysis of galaxies in the redshift-space selected group and\nfield environments at z~0.4. Groups contain a much higher fraction of S0s at\nfixed luminosity than the lower density field, with >99.999% confidence. Indeed\nthe S0 fraction in groups is at least as high as in z~0.4 clusters and X-ray\nselected groups, which have more luminous Intra Group Medium (IGM). An 97%\nconfident excess of S0s at >=0.3Mpc from the group centre at fixed luminosity,\ntells us that formation is not restricted to, and possibly even avoids, the\ngroup cores. Interactions with a bright X-ray emitting IGM cannot be important\nfor the formation of the majority of S0s in the Universe. In contrast to S0s,\nthe fraction of elliptical galaxies in groups at fixed luminosity is similar to\nthe field, whilst the brightest ellipticals are strongly enhanced towards the\ngroup centres (>99.999% confidence within 0.3Mpc). We conclude that the group\nand sub-group environments must be dominant for the formation of S0 galaxies,\nand that minor mergers, galaxy harassment and tidal interactions are the most\nlikely responsible mechanisms. This has implications not only for the inferred\npre-processing of cluster galaxies, but also for the global morphological and\nstar formation budget of galaxies: as hierarchical clustering progresses, more\ngalaxies will be subject to these transformations as they enter the group\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2008 22:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The data were obtained with the MEGACAM and CFH12K\ncameras at the CFHT. We used the resulting photometry in 5 broad band filters\n(u*, B, V, R, and I), that included new u*-band data, to fit spectral models.\nWith these spectral fits we inferred a cluster membership criterium, as well as\nthe ages, dust extinctions, and photometric types of these fLSBs. We show that\nabout half of the Coma cluster fLSBs have a spectral energy distribution well\nrepresented in our template library while the other half present a flux deficit\nat ultraviolet wavelengths. Among the well represented, ~80% are probably part\nof the Coma cluster based on their spectral energy distribution. They are\nrelatively young (younger than 2.3 Gyrs for 90% of the sample) non-starburst\nobjects. The later their type, the younger fLSBs are. A significant part of the\nfLSBs are quite dusty objects. fLSBs are low stellar mass objects (the later\ntheir type the less massive they are), with stellar masses comparable to\nglobular clusters for the faintest ones. Their characteristics are correlated\nwith infall directions, confirming the disruptive origin for part of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2008 08:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The effect is due to graviton-ghost\ncondensates arising from the interference of quantum coherent states. The\ntheory is constructed as follows: Faddeev-Popov-De Witt gauged path integral ->\nfactorization of classical and quantum variables -> transition to the 1-loop\napproximation -> choice of ghost sector, satisfying 1-loop finiteness of the\ntheory off the mass shell. The Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirckwood-Yvon (BBGKY)\nchain for the spectral function of gravitons renormalized by ghosts is used to\nbuild a theory of gravitons in the isotropic Universe. We found three exact\nsolutions of the equations that describe virtual graviton and ghost condensates\nas well as condensates of instanton fluctuations. Exact solutions correspond to\nvarious condensates with different graviton-ghost compositions. The formalism\nof the BBGKY chain takes into account the contribution of non-relativistic\nmatter in the formation of a common self-consistent gravitational field. It is\nshown that the era of non-relativistic matter dominance must be replaced by an\nera of dominance of graviton-ghost condensate. Pre-asymptotic state of DE is a\ncondensate of virtual gravitons and ghosts with a constant conformal\nwavelength. The asymptotic state predicted by the theory is a graviton-ghost\ncondensate of constant physical wavelength in the De Sitter space. Such DE\nphenomenon is presented in the form of the model that interpolates the exact\nsolutions of equations of 1-loop QG.

We show that, under certain mild assumptions on G,\nthe field of fractions Frac(Z) of Z is G-equivariantly isomorphic to the\nfunction field of the dual space g* with twisted G-action. In particular\nFrac(Z) is rational. This confirms a conjecture J. Alev. Furthermore we show\nthat Z is a unique factorisation domain, confirming a conjecture of A. Braun\nand C. Hajarnavis. Recently, A. Premet used the above result about Frac(Z), a\nresult of Colliot-Thelene, Kunyavskii, Popov and Reichstein and reduction mod p\narguments to show that the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture cannot hold for simple\ncomplex Lie algebras that are not of type A, C or G_2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2008 15:47:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2008 21:56:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 21:26:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 17:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-21"}
