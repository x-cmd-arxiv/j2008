It has been proposed that the\nprocess of information maximization (infomax), which maximizes the information\ntransmission from the input to the output of a feedforward network, may provide\nan explanation of the stimulus selectivity of neurons in CNSs. However, CNSs\ncontain not only feedforward but also recurrent synaptic connections, and\nlittle is known about information retention over time in such recurrent\nnetworks. Here, we propose a learning algorithm based on infomax in a recurrent\nnetwork, which we call \"recurrent infomax\" (RI). RI maximizes information\nretention and thereby minimizes information loss in a network. We find that\nfeeding in external inputs consisting of information obtained from photographs\nof natural scenes into an RI-based model of a recurrent network results in the\nappearance of Gabor-like selectivity quite similar tothat existing in simple\ncells of the primary visual cortex (V1). More importantly, we find that without\nexternal input, this network exhibits cell assembly-like and synfire chain-like\nspontaneous activity and a critical neuronal avalanche. RI provides a simple\nframework to explain a wide range of phenomena observed in in vivo and in vitro\nneuronal networks, and it should provide a novel understanding of experimental\nresults for multineuronal activity and plasticity from an information-theoretic\npoint of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2008 08:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-15"}

We show the modified algorithm converges to\nthe leading eigenvector of the matrix EC, where C is the input covariance\nmatrix. When there is no inspecificity, this gives the classical result of\nconvergence to the first principal component of the input distribution (PC1).\nWe then study the outcome of learning using different versions of E. In the\nmost biologically plausible case, arising when there are no intrinsically\nprivileged connections, E has diagonal elements Q and off- diagonal elements\n(1-Q)/(n-1), where Q, the quality, is expected to decrease with the number of\ninputs n.

One way to achieve this concept\nis to perturb the acoustic forcing. Recently, due to the improvements\nassociated with using dual frequency sources, this method has been the subject\nof many studies which have proved its applicability and advantages. Due to this\nreason, in this paper, the oscillations of a spherical bubble driven by a dual\nfrequency source, were studied and compared to the ones driven by a single\nsource. Results indicated that using dual frequency had a strong impact on\nreducing the chaotic oscillations to regular ones. The governing parameters\ninfluencing its dynamics are the secondary frequency and its phase difference\nwith the fundamental frequency. Also using dual frequency forcing may arm us by\nthe possibility of generating oscillations of desired amplitudes. To our\nknowledge the investigation of the ability of using a dual frequency forcing to\ncontrol chaotic oscillations are presented for the first time in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2008 11:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-15"}

The approach is based on the analysis of the outputs\nfrom the model after a series of perturbations in the input parameters\ncontrolling the baryonic physics. The perturbations are chosen in a way that\nthey do not change the results in the luminosity function or mass function of\nthe galaxy population. We apply this approach on a particular semi-analytic\nmodel called GalICS. We chose to perturb the parameters controlling the\nefficiency of star formation and the efficiency of supernova feedback. We keep\ntrack of the baryonic and observable properties of the central galaxies in a\nsample of dark matter halos with masses ranging from 10^{10} M_sol to 10^{13}\nM_sol. We find very different responses depending on the halo mass. For small\ndark matter halos its central galaxy responds in a highly predictable way to\nsmall perturbation in the star formation and feedback efficiency. For massive\ndark matter halos, minor perturbations in the input parameters can induce large\nfluctuations on the properties of its central galaxy, at least $\\sim 0.1$ in\n(B-V) color or $\\sim 0.5$ mag in U or r filter, in a seemingly random fashion.\nWe quantify this behavior through an objective scalar function we call\npredictability. We argue that finding the origin of this behavior needs\nadditional information from other approximations and different semi-analytic\ncodes. Furthermore, the implementation of an scalar objective function, such as\nthe predictability, opens the door to quantitative benchmarking of\nsemi-analytic codes based on its numerical performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2008 13:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-15"}

A prominence was located over the polarity inversion line (PIL) in\nthe south-east of the main sunspot. These observations provided us with a time\nseries of vector magnetic fields on the photosphere under the prominence. We\nfound four features: (1) The abutting opposite-polarity regions on the two\nsides along the PIL first grew laterally in size and then narrowed. (2) These\nabutting regions contained vertically-weak, but horizontally-strong magnetic\nfields. (3) The orientations of the horizontal magnetic fields along the PIL on\nthe photosphere gradually changed with time from a normal-polarity\nconfiguration to a inverse-polarity one.
