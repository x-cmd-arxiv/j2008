Photometric time series\nwere obtained on the 1.8m telescope at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory\n(DAO) in Victoria, BC, and were analyzed for the presence of occultation\nevents. Observations were performed at 40 Hz and included a total of 5.0\nstar-hours for target stars in the ecliptic open cluster M35 (beta=0.9deg), and\n2.1 star-hours for control stars in the off-ecliptic open cluster M34\n(beta=25.7deg). To evaluate the recovery fraction of the analysis method, and\nthereby determine the limiting detectable size, artificial occultation events\nwere added to simulated time series (1/f scintillation-like power-spectra), and\nto the real data. No viable candidate occultation events were detected. This\nlimits the cumulative surface density of KBOs to 3.5e10 deg^{-2} (95%\nconfidence) for KBOs brighter than m_R=35.3 (larger than ~860m in diameter,\nassuming a geometric albedo of 0.04 and a distance of 40 AU). An evaluation of\nTNO occultations reported in the literature suggests that they are unlikely to\nbe genuine, and an overall 95%-confidence upper limit on the surface density of\n2.8e9 deg^{-2} is obtained for KBOs brighter than m_R=35 (larger than ~1 km in\ndiameter, assuming a geometric albedo of 0.04 and a distance of 40 AU) when all\nexisting surveys are combined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2008 21:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The basic integrate-and-fire neuron is adopted, and the\ndynamics is estimated computationally so as to obtain the activation at each\nnode along each instant of time. In the transient case, the dynamics is\nimplemented so as to conserve the total activation entering the system. In our\nequilibrium investigations, the internally stored activation is limited to the\nvalue of the respective threshold. The synchronization of the activation of the\nnetwork is then quantified in terms of its normalized entropy. The equilibrium\ninvestigations involve the application of a number of complementary\ncharacterization methods, including spectra and Principal Component Analysis,\nas well as of an equivalent model capable of reproducing both the transient and\nequilibrium dynamics. The potential of such concepts and measurements is\nexplored with respect to several theoretical models, as well as for the\nneuronal network of \\emph{C. elegans}. A series of interesting results are\nobtained and discussed, including the fact that all models led to a transient\nperiod of synchronization, whose specific features depend on the topological\nstructures of the networks. The investigations of the equilibrium dynamics\nrevealed a series of remarkable insights, including the relationship between\nspiking oscillations and the hierarchical structure of the networks and the\nidentification of twin correlation patterns between node degree and total\nactivation, implying that hubs of connectivity are also hubs of\nintegrate-and-fire activation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2008 02:04:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2008 14:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-18"}

Thanks to the advances in sub-millimeter\nobservations, a wide range of observed initial conditions enable us to study\nthe different modes of low-mass star formation. The challenge for the\nsimulations is to reproduce the observational results. Two main numerical\nmethods, namely AMR and SPH, are widely used to simulate the collapse and the\nfragmentation of prestellar cores. We compare thoroughly these two methods\nwithin their standard framework. We use the AMR code RAMSES and the SPH code\nDRAGON.
