These parameters are derived for individual stars using CMFGEN, the\nnLTE, line-blanketed model atmosphere code of Hillier et al., 1998. The B\nsupergiant temperature scale derived here shows a reduction of 1000 - 3000 K\ncompared to previous results obtained using unblanketed codes. Mass loss rate\nestimates are in good agreement with predicted theoretical values and all of\nthe 20 B0 - B5 supergiants analysed show evidence for CNO processing. The\nobserved WLR values calculated for B0 - B0.7 supergiants are larger than\npredicted values, whereas the reverse is true for B1 - B5 supergiants. This\nmeans that the discrepancy between observed and theoretical values cannot be\nresolved by adopting clumped (i.e., lower) mass loss rates, as for O stars. The\nmost surprising result is that, although CMFGEN succeeds in reproducing the\noptical spectrum accurately, it fails to reproduce key UV diagnostics, such as\nNV and CIV P Cygni profiles, precisely. This problem arises because the models\nare not ionised enough and fail to reproduce the full extent of the observed\nabsorption trough of the P Cygni profiles. These findings add further support\nto the need to revise the standard model of massive star winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2008 17:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Whatever the\nrationale proposed by economists to account for the existence of firms, their\nperspective is based on efficiency and cost analysis. Little attention is paid\nto the dynamics of emergence and evolution of firms. The aim of the present\nmanuscript is to check the global dynamical properties of a very simple model\nbased on bounded rationality and reinforcement learning.\n  Workers and managers are localised on a lattice and they choose collaborators\non the basis of the success of previous work relations.

We model the stellar matter as an\nelectrically neutral and lightly ionized plasma composed of three moving\nparticle species: neutrons, protons, and electrons, which can be converted into\neach other by weak interactions (beta decays), suffer binary collisions, and be\naffected by each other's macroscopic electromagnetic fields. Since the\nevolution of the magnetic field occurs over thousands of years or more,\ncompared to dynamical time scales (sound and Alfv\\'en) of milliseconds to\nseconds, we use a slow-motion approximation in which we neglect the inertial\nterms in the equations of motion for the particles. We restrict ourselves to a\none-dimensional geometry in which the magnetic field points in one Cartesian\ndirection but varies only along an orthogonal direction. We study the evolution\nof the system in three different ways: (i) estimating time scales directly from\nthe equations, guided by physical intuition; (ii) a normal-mode analysis in the\nlimit of a nearly uniform system; and (iii) a finite-difference numerical\nintegration of the equations of motion.

Hence the Galactic centre\n(GC) is their only suggested place of origin. Edelmann et al. (2005) found the\nearly B-star HE0437-5439 to be too short-lived to have reached its current\nposition in the Galactic halo if ejected from the GC, except if being a blue\nstraggler. Its proximity to the LMC suggested an origin from this galaxy. Aims:\nThe chemical signatures of stars at the GC are significantly different from\nthose in the LMC. Hence, an accurate measurement of the abundance pattern of\nHE0437-5439 will yield a new tight constraint on the place of birth of this\nstar. Methods: High-resolution spectra obtained with UVES on the VLT are\nanalysed using state-of-the-art non-LTE modelling techniques. Results: We\nmeasured abundances of individual elements to very high accuracy in HE0437-5439\nas well as in two reference stars, from the LMC and the solar neighbourhood.\nThe abundance pattern is not consistent at all with that observed in stars near\nthe GC, ruling our an origin from the GC. However, there is a high degree of\nconsistency with the LMC abundance pattern. Our abundance results cannot rule\nout an origin in the outskirts of the Galactic disk. However, we find the life\ntime of HE0437-5439 to be more than 3 times shorter than the time of flight to\nthe edge of the disk, rendering a Galactic origin unlikely. Conclusions: Only\none SMBH is known to be present in Galaxy and none in the LMC. Hence the\nexclusion of an GC origin challenges the SMBH paradigm.

Current estimations of coherence properties often assume\nthat undulator sources are quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely on\nthe application of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem for calculating the degree\nof transverse coherence. Such assumption is not adequate when treating third\ngeneration light sources, because the vertical(geometrical) emittance of the\nelectron beam is comparable or even much smaller than the radiation wavelength\nin a very wide spectral interval that spans over four orders of magnitude (from\n0.1 Angstrom up to 10^3 Angstrom).

The focus\nof this work is to understand under which circumstances large events are better\npredictable than smaller events. Therefore we use a simple prediction algorithm\nbased on precursory structures which are identified using the maximum\nlikelihood principle. Using the receiver operator characteristic curve as a\nmeasure for the quality of predictions we find that the dependence on the event\nmagnitude is closely linked to the probability distribution function of the\nunderlying stochastic process. We evaluate this dependence on the probability\ndistribution function analytically and numerically. If we assume that the\noptimal precursory structures are used to make the predictions, we find that\nlarge increments are better predictable if the underlying stochastic process\nhas a Gaussian probability distribution function, whereas larger increments are\nharder to predict if the underlying probability distribution function has a\npower law tail. In the case of an exponential distribution function we find no\nsignificant dependence on the event magnitude. Furthermore we compare these\nresults with predictions of increments in correlated data, namely, velocity\nincrements of a free jet flow. The velocity increments in the free jet flow are\nin dependence on the time scale either asymptotically Gaussian or\nasymptotically exponential distributed. The numerical results for predictions\nwithin free jet data are in good agreement with the previous analytical\nconsiderations for random numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2008 15:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-30"}
