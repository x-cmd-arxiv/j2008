The aim of this study was therefore to synthesize\nfine particles of calcite with controlled morphology by hydrothermal\ncarbonation of calcium hydroxide at high CO2 pressure (initial PCO2=55 bar) and\nat moderate and high temperature (30 and 90 degrees C). The morphology of\nprecipitated particles was identified by transmission electron microscopy\n(TEM/EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS). In addition, an X-ray\ndiffraction analysis was performed to investigate the carbonation efficiency\nand purity of the solid product. Carbonation of dispersed calcium hydroxide in\nthe presence of supercritical (PT=90 bar, T=90 degrees C) or gaseous (PT=55\nbar, T=30 degrees C) CO2 led to the precipitation of sub-micrometric isolated\nparticles (<1$\\mu$m) and micrometric agglomerates (<5$\\mu$m) of calcite. For\nthis study, the carbonation efficiency (Ca(OH)2-CaCO3 conversion) was not\nsignificantly affected by PT conditions after 24 h of reaction. In contrast,\nthe initial rate of calcium carbonate precipitation increased from 4.3 mol/h in\nthe \"90bar-90 degrees C\" system to 15.9 mol/h in the \"55bar-30 degrees C\"\nsystem. The use of high CO2 pressure may therefore be desirable for increasing\nthe production rate of CaCO3, carbonation efficiency and purity, to\napproximately 48 kg/m3h, 95% and 96.3%, respectively in this study. The\ndissipated heat for this exothermic reaction was estimated by calorimetry to be\n-32 kJ/mol in the \"90bar-90 degrees C\" system and -42 kJ/mol in the \"55bar-30\ndegrees C\" system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2008 16:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Cross-correlations confirm these null-results.\nAt least six stars are magnetic and we provide magnetic field measurements for\nfour of them, of which three are newly discovered magnetic stars. It is found\nthat four stars have magnetic fields smaller than ~ 2 kG, which according to\ntheoretical predictions might be insufficient for suppressing envelope\nconvection around the magnetic poles for more evolved Ap stars. Suppression of\nconvection is expected to be essential for the opacity mechanism acting in the\nhydrogen ionisation zone to drive the high-overtone roAp pulsations\nefficiently. Our null-results suggest that the more evolved roAp stars may\nrequire particularly strong magnetic fields to pulsate. Three of the studied\nstars do, however, have magnetic fields stronger than 5 kG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2008 17:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The decision mechanism calls for each\nrelay that is able to decode the information from the source to compare its\nrelay-to-destination channel gain with a given threshold.

These\nmodels are motivated by limitations on the available channel state information\nas well as ease of implementation as compared to the optimum distributed\nstrategy.

Results: We present simple formulas for the upper limit\nof the amplitude, frequency and phase uncertainties in time-series analyses. We\nalso demonstrate the possibility to detect frequencies which are separated by\nless than the classical frequency resolution and that the realistic frequency\nerror is at least 4 times smaller than the classical frequency resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2008 14:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

When applying harmonic boundary oscillations this saturation\nvalue caused by librator type orbits is gradually destroyed via two fundamental\nprocesses which are discussed in detail.

A theoretical model is presented that aims to describe\nprotein transport inside the nucleus, a process which is influenced by the\npresence of a boundary (i.e. membrane). A set of reaction-diffusion equations\nis employed to model both the diffusion of proteins and their interaction with\nimmobile binding sites.

Semi-analytical expressions are used to\ndefine the boundaries of on- (off-) rate parameter space in simplified cases\nwhen molecules move within a bounded domain.

Its motivation is based on experimental final-state observations of\none heavy nucleus, a small number of light fragments and numerous individual\nnucleons. It is theoretically described as two step process involving energy\ndeposition in the target nucleus and subsequent evaporation. Several models,\nbased on different assumptions, have been constructed in order to describe the\nspallation process. The main subject of this work is description of global\naverage properties of proton induced spallation reactions in wide range of\nprojectile energy (0.1 - 10 GeV) and mass of target nuclei. This is\ninvestigated within Hadron String Dynamics (HSD) model, based on Boltzmann -\nUehling - Uhlenbeck (BUU) equation, supplemented by a statistical evaporation\nmodel for the second stage of the reaction. It has been shown that spallation\nis the most probable scenario of proton - nucleus reaction. Proton induced\nreactions, in considered here incident energy range, are visibly non-invasive\nprocesses. Properties of residual nuclei after the first stage of the reaction\nare weakly dependent on incident energy, but strongly dependent on mass of\ntarget. The second stage of the reaction is a competition of evaporation and\nfission. Results obtained from the HSD model vary smoothly as function of\nproton incident energy and mass of target, so interpolation of the results is\nquite feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2008 15:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-07"}
