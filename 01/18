Here we\nreport on calculations of not only the numerical CMB power spectrum from the\nPMF, but also the correlations between the CMB power spectrum from the PMF and\nthe primary curvature perturbations. We then deduce a precise estimate of the\nPMF effect on all modes of perturbations. We find that the PMF affects not only\nthe CMB TT and TE modes on small angular scales, but also on large angular\nscales. The introduction of a PMF leads to a better fit to the CMB power\nspectrum for the higher multipoles, and the fit at lowest multipoles can be\nused to constrain the correlation of the PMF with the density fluctuations for\nlarge negative values of the spectral index. Our prediction for the BB mode for\na PMF average field strength $|B_\\lambda| =4.0$ nG is consistent with the upper\nlimit on the BB mode deduced from the latest CMB observations. We find that the\nBB mode is dominated by the vector mode of the PMF for higher multipoles. We\nalso show that by fitting the complete power spectrum one can break the\ndegeneracy between the PMF amplitude and its power spectral index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2008 16:20:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2008 12:33:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2008 06:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Recent technological developments provide many possible\nrealizations of effectively one-dimensional systems. These devices promise to\ngive us access to a new range of phenomena. It is therefore very interesting to\ndevelop theoretical methods specific for such systems to model their behavior\nand calculate the correlators of the resulting theory. Incidentally, one such\nmethod exists and is known as Bosonization. It can be applied to\none-dimensional systems and effectively describes low energy excitations in a\nuniversal way. We use the example of a correlator known as the Emptiness\nFormation Probability to show that Bosonization fails to describe some long\nrange correlators corresponding to large disturbances (the EFP measures the\nprobability for the ground state of the system to develop a region without\nparticles). We trace this failure to the fact that Bosonization is constructed\nas a linear approximation of the full theory and we set up to develop a\ncollective description with the required non-linearity. The resulting scheme is\nessentially a Hydrodynamic paradigm for quantum systems. We show how to\nconstruct such a hydrodynamic description for a variety of exactly integrable\nmodels and illustrate how it can be used to make new predictions.

It is shown that the incomplete Paschen-Back effect can lead to\nnoticeable line shifts which strongly depend on total multiplet strength,\nmagnetic field strength and field direction. Ghost components (which violate\nthe normal selection rule on J) show up in strong magnetic fields but are\nprobably unobservable. Finally it is shown that measurements of the integrated\nmagnetic field modulus $H_s$ are not adversely affected by the Paschen-Back\neffect, and that there is a potential problem in (magnetic) Doppler mapping if\nlines in the Paschen-Back regime are treated in the Zeeman approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2008 18:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The theory further predicts that at\nmodest physical conditions, polymer charge is compensated and reversed with\nincreasing divalent salt.

The\nexistence of this noise implies that two nearby discharged conductors at finite\ntemperature should repel each other, as a result of the electrodynamic\ninteraction between the Johnson-Nyquist currents in either conductor and the\neddy currents they induce in the other. It is suggested that this force is at\nthe origin of the recently discovered large repulsive correction to the thermal\nCasimir force between two lossy metallic plates. Further support for this\nphysical picture is obtained by studying a simple system of two linear noisy\nantennas. Using elementary concepts from circuit theory, we show that the\nrepulsive force engendered by the Johnson-Nyquist noise results in the same\nkind of thermodynamic inconsistencies found in the Casimir problem. We show\nthat all inconsistencies are however resolved if account is taken of capacitive\neffects associated with the end points of the antennas.

Unlike previous works, which considered\nthermodynamic quantities averaged over many different inhomogeneous sequences,\nwe focused on precise sequences and investigated the succession of local\nopenings that lead to their dissociation. For this purpose, we performed\nTransfer Integral type calculations with two different dynamical models, namely\nthe heterogeneous Dauxois-Peyrard-Bishop model and the model based on finite\nstacking enthalpies we recently proposed. It appears that, for both models, the\nessential effect of heterogeneity is to let different portions of the\ninvestigated sequences open at slightly different temperatures. Besides this\nmacroscopic effect, the local aperture of each portion indeed turns out to be\nvery similar to that of a homogeneous sequence with the same length. Rounding\nof each local opening transition is therefore merely a size effect. For the\nDauxois-Peyrard-Bishop model, sequences with a few thousands base pairs are\nstill far from the thermodynamic limit, so that it is inappropriate, for this\nmodel, to discuss the order of the transition associated with each local\nopening. In contrast, sequences with several hundreds to a few thousands base\npairs are pretty close to the thermodynamic limit for the model we proposed.\nThe temperature interval where power laws holds is consequently broad enough to\nenable the estimation of critical exponents. On the basis of the few examples\nwe investigated, it seems that, for our model, disorder does not necessarily\ninduce a decrease of the order of the transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2008 09:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-07"}

It is well known that DPLL is\nunable to find the ground states in the clustered phase of the problem, i.e.\nthat it leads to contradictions with probability 1. However, no solid argument\nsupports this is general. A class of heuristics, which includes the well known\nUC and GUC, is introduced and studied. It is shown that any heuristic in this\nclass must fail if the clause to variable ratio is larger than some constant,\nwhich depends on the heuristic but is always smaller than the clustering\nthreshold.\n  The second result concerns the properties of random k-SAT at large clause to\nvariable ratios.

The calculations employ pseudopotentials and\nB-spline basis sets to expand the single particle orbitals used to construct\nthe trial wavefunctions. Extensive tests on system size, time step, and other\nsources of errors, performed on periodically repeated systems of up to 1050\natoms, show that all these errors together can be reduced to below 10 meV per\nformula unit. We find excellent agreement with the experiments for the\nequilibrium volume of both the Mg and the MgH$_2$ crystals. The cohesive energy\nof the Mg crystal is found to be 1.51(1) eV, and agrees perfectly with the\nexperimental value of 1.51 eV. The enthalpy of formation of MgH$_2$ from Mg\nbulk and H$_2$ gas is found to be $0.85 \\pm 0.01$ eV/formula unit, or $82 \\pm\n1$ kJ/mole, which is off the experimental one of $76.1 \\pm 1$ kJ/mole only by 6\nkJ/mole. This shows that DMC can almost achieve chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mole)\non this system.

We investigate the linear stability of a solidification front\nunder such conditions, pointing out the destabilizing role of the thermal and\nsolutal fields, and the stabilizing role of the pressure gradient. The main\nconsequence of the very small solidification rate is the importance of\nadvective transport of solute in liquid, which tends to remove light solute\nfrom the vicinity of the ICB and to suppress supercooling, thus acting against\nthe destabilization of the solidification front.

Methods: Our code for the self-consistent\ncomputation of the coronal magnetic fields and the coronal plasma solves the\nnon-force-free magnetohydrostatic equilibria using an optimization method.\nPrevious versions of the code have been used to compute non-linear force-free\ncoronal magnetic fields from photospheric measurements in Cartesian and\nspherical geometry, and magnetostatic-equilibria in Cartesian geometry.

The polarization of the ${\\lambda}4554$ line is\nclearly affected due to isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen although the\ncollisional depolarization of its upper level $^2P_{3/2}$ is negligible.
