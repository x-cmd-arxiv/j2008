The super-Hubble dynamics are ultralocal,\nallowing us to neglect spatial derivatives and treat each Hubble patch as a\nseparate universe. This provides a natural framework in which to discuss\nprobabilities on the space of solutions and initial conditions. In this article\nwe derive an evolution equation for this probability for an arbitrary class of\nmatter systems, including DBI and k-inflationary models, and discover\nequilibrium solutions that satisfy detailed balance. Our results are more\ngeneral than those derived assuming slow roll or a quasi-de Sitter geometry,\nand so are directly applicable to models that do not satisfy the usual slow\nroll conditions. We discuss in general terms the conditions for eternal\ninflation to set in, and we give explicit numerical solutions of highly\nstochastic, quasi-stationary trajectories in the relativistic DBI regime.\nFinally, we show that the probability for stochastic/thermal tunneling can be\nsignificantly enhanced relative to the Hawking-Moss instanton result due to\nrelativistic DBI effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2008 20:16:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2008 00:18:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2008 14:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The main results can be summarized as follows:\n1) Throughout the monitoring campaign, NGC6251 was in relatively high-flux\nstate. 2) The flux persistently changed with fluctuations of the order of ~2 on\ntime scales of 20-30 days. 3) When the hardness ratio is plotted against the\naverage count rate, there is evidence for a spectral hardening as the source\nbrightens; this finding is confirmed by a flux-selected spectral analysis. 4)\nThe fractional variability appears to be more pronounced in the hard energy\nband (5-12 keV) than in the soft one (2.5-5 keV). 5) 2-month averaged and\nflux-limited energy spectra are adequately fitted by a power law. A Fe Kalpha\nline is never statistically required, although the presence of a strong iron\nline cannot be ruled out, due to the high upper limits on the line equivalent\nwidth. The inconsistency of the spectral variability behavior of NGC6251 with\nthe typical trend observed in Seyfert galaxies and the similarity with blazars\nlead support to a jet-dominated scenario during the RXTE monitoring campaign.\nHowever, a possible contribution from a disk-corona system cannot be ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2008 16:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We\nmotivate degravitation-- where Netwon's constant is promoted to a scale\ndependent filter function-- as arising from either a small (resonant) mass for\nthe graviton, or as an effect in semi-classical gravity. After addressing how\nthe Bianchi identities are to be satisfied in such a set up, we turn our\nattention towards the cosmological consequences of degravitation. By\nconsidering the example filter function corresponding to a resonantly massive\ngraviton (with a filter scale larger than the present horizon scale), we show\nthat slow roll inflation, hybrid inflation and old inflation remain\nquantitatively unchanged. We also find that the degravitation mechanism\ninherits a memory of past energy densities in the present epoch in such a way\nthat is likely significant for present cosmological evolution. For example, if\nthe universe underwent inflation in the past due to it having tunneled out of\nsome false vacuum, we find that degravitation implies a remnant `afterglow'\ncosmological constant, whose scale immediately afterwards is parametrically\nsuppressed by the filter scale ($L$) in Planck units $\\Lambda \\sim\nl^2_{pl}/L^2$. We discuss circumstances through which this scenario reasonably\nyields the presently observed value for $\\Lambda \\sim O(10^{-120})$.

Important tests for\nthis scenario include (i) the X-ray properties of galaxies in the transition\nzone between the two clouds and (ii) the incidence of AGN in post-starbursts,\ni.e. systems observed shortly after (<1Gyr) the termination of their\nstar-formation. We perform these tests by combining deep Chandra observations\nwith multiwavelength data from the AEGIS survey. Stacking the X-ray photons at\nthe positions of galaxies (0.4<z<0.9) not individually detected at X-ray\nwavelengths suggests a population of obscured AGN among sources in the\ntransition zone and in the red cloud. Their mean X-ray and mid-IR properties\nare consistent with moderately obscured low-luminosity AGN, Compton thick\nsources or a mix of both. Morphologies show that major mergers are unlikely to\ndrive the evolution of this population but minor interactions may play a role.\nThe incidence of obscured AGN in the red cloud (both direct detections and\nstacking results) suggests that BH accretion outlives the termination of the\nstar-formation. This is also supported by our finding that post-starburst\ngalaxies at z~0.8 and AGN are associated, in agreement with recent results at\nlow-z. A large fraction of post-starbursts and red cloud galaxies show evidence\nfor at least moderate levels of AGN obscuration. This implies that if AGN\noutflows cause the colour transformation of galaxies, then some nuclear gas and\ndust clouds either remain unaffected or relax to the central galaxy regions\nafter the quenching their star-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2008 21:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We consider this approach promising since, by working\neffectively with an elliptically fibred M-theory compactification, the explicit\npositioning of D7-branes by (M-theory) fluxes is straightforward. The locations\nof D7-branes are encoded in the periods of certain M-theory cycles, which\nallows for a very explicit understanding of the moduli space of D7-brane\nmotion. The picture of moving D7-branes on a fixed underlying space relies on\nnegligible backreaction, which can be ensured in Sen's weak coupling limit.\nHowever, even in this limit we find certain 'physics obstructions' which reduce\nthe freedom of the D7-brane motion as compared to the motion of holomorphic\nsubmanifolds in the orientifold background.

While these emissions are expected to be\nreadily detectable in the future by GLAST, the situation for available EGRET\ndata is more challenging. Aims: The theory of gamma-ray emission from IC\nscattering on the solar radiation field by Galactic CR electrons is given in\ndetail. This is used as the basis for detection and model verification using\nEGRET data. Methods: We present a detailed study of the solar emission using\nthe EGRET database, accounting for the effect of the emission from 3C 279, the\nmoon, and other sources, which interfere with the solar emission. The analysis\nwas performed for 2 energy ranges, above 300 MeV and for 100-300 MeV, as well\nas for the combination to improve the detection statistics. The technique was\ntested on the moon signal, with our results consistent with previous work.\nResults: Analyzing the EGRET database, we find evidence of emission from the\nsolar disk and its halo. The observations are compared with our model for the\nextended emission. The spectrum of the solar disk emission and the spectrum of\nthe extended emission have been obtained. The spectrum of the moon is also\ngiven. Conclusions: The observed intensity distribution and the flux are\nconsistent with the predicted model of IC gamma-rays from the halo around the\nSun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2008 23:07:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2008 16:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

From the cross polarization\nspectral density analysis, it is concluded that a large J-coupling of the order\nof 2 kHz exists between these nuclei and that its angular dependence is not of\na simple pseudo-dipolar type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2008 06:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-11"}

For consideration we choose the disk wind model described by\nGarcia et al. (2001), where a gas component of the wind is heated by an\nambipolar diffusion up to the temperature of the order of 10$^4$ K. It is shown\nthat the dust grains heating due to collisions with the gas atoms and electrons\nis inefficient in comparison with heating by the stellar radiation, and thus,\ndust survives even in the hot wind component. Owing to this, the disk wind may\nbe opaque for the ultraviolet and optical radiation of the star and is capable\nto absorb its noticeable fraction. Calculations show that at the accretion rate\n$\\dot{M_a} = 10^{-8}-10^{-6} M_\\odot$ per year this fraction for TTSs may range\nfrom 20% to 40% of a total luminosity of the star correspondingly. This means\nthat the disk wind in TTSs can play the same role as the puffed inner rim\nconsidered in the modern models of accretion disks. In Herbig Ae stars (HAEs)\ninner regions of the disk winds ($r \\le 0.5$ AU) are free of dust since there\ndust grains sublimate under the effect of the radiation of the star. Therefore,\nin this case a fraction of the absorbed radiation by the disk wind is\nsignificantly less, and may be compared with the effect of the \"puffed-up inner\nrim\" only at $\\dot{M_a} \\geq 10^{-6} M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Due to the structural\ninhomogeneity of the disk wind its optical depth towards an observer may be\nvariable resulting in the photometric activity of the young stars. For the same\nreason, one can observe moving shadows from the gas and dust streams with the\nspiral-like structure on the highly resolved circumstellar disk images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2008 09:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The model allows probabilistic predictions on the likelihood of\ncountry outbreaks and their magnitude. The level of predictability offered by\nthe model can be quantitatively analyzed and related to the appearance of\nrobust epidemic pathways that represent the most probable routes for the spread\nof the disease.

Additionally, a set of\nabout 1,000 low resolution, optical night-sky spectra have been extracted and\nanalyzed. The unprecedented database discussed in this paper has led to the\ndetection of a clear seasonal variation of the broad band night sky brightness\nin the VRI passbands, similar to the well known semi-annual oscillation of the\nNaI D doublet. The spectroscopic data demonstrate that this seasonality is\ncommon to all spectral features, with the remarkable exception of the OH\nrotational-vibrational bands.

We deal with\nentire solutions of periodic and almost periodic parabolic equations including\nthe elliptic framework as a particular case. We derive a Liouville type result\nfor periodic operators as a consequence of a result for operators periodic in\njust one variable, which is new even in the elliptic case. More precisely, we\nshow that if $c\\leq0$ and $a_{ij}, b_i, c, f$ are periodic in the same\nspace/time direction, with the same period, then any bounded solution $u$ of\n$$\\partial_t\nu-a_{ij}(x,t)\\partial_{ij}u-b_i(x,t)\\partial_iu-c(x,t)u=f(x,t),\\quad x\\in\\R^N,\\\nt\\in\\R,$$ is periodic in that direction. We then derive the following Liouville\ntype result: if $c\\leq0, f\\equiv0$ and $a_{ij}, b_i, c$ are periodic in all the\nspace/time variables, with the same periods, then the space of bounded\nsolutions of the above equation has at most dimension one. In the case of the\nequation $\\partial_t u-Lu=f(x,t)$, with $L$ periodic elliptic operator\nindependent of $t$, the hypothesis $c\\leq0$ can be weaken by requiring that the\nperiodic principal eigenvalue of $-L$ is nonnegative. Instead, the periodicity\nassumption cannot be relaxed, because we explicitly exhibit an almost periodic\nfunction $b$ such that the space of bounded solutions of $u''+b(x)u'=0$ in $\\R$\nhas dimension 2, and it is generated by the constant solution and a non-almost\nperiodic solution. Next, a sufficient condition for any bounded solution to be\nalmost periodicis derived.

Combining the Thomas-Fermi theory and simple\nelectrostatics, we show that it is possible to construct a model screening\nfunction that has the merit of being of simple physical interpretation.

Our first-principles calculations and the\nThomas-Fermi theory clearly show that in Si and Ge nanocrystals, local field\neffects are dominated by surface polarization, which causes a reduction of the\nscreening in going from the bulk down to the nanoscale.

We\nprove the existence of an invariant ergodic measure $\\nu$ associated with the\ntransition semigroup $P_t$; further, we identify its infinitesimal generator in\nthe space $L^2(H;\\nu)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2008 15:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-16"}

This is in accordance with a conjecture of Dubrovin, suggesting that\nthis is a universal phenomenon for any Hamiltonian perturbation of a hyperbolic\nequation.

We present here the preliminary results of\nultraviolet and X-ray data for a sample of three shell galaxies, namely NGC\n474, NGC 7070A and ESO 2400100. The Far UV morphology and photometry are\nderived using the observations obtained with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and\nthe XMM- Newton Optical Monitor. We aim at investigating the rejuvenation\nprocesses in the stellar population using the UV information as well as at\ngaining information about the possible evolution with time of the X-ray\nemission due interaction/merging processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2008 15:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-16"}
