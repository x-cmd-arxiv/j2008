This paper outlines a holographic\ncharged preon model where preons are strands with finite energy density\nspecified by bits of information identifying the charge on each end. In the\nmodel, SM particles consist of three strands with spin states corresponding to\nwrapped states of the strands. SM particles in this wrapped preon model can be\napproximated by preon bound states in non-local dynamics based on three-preon\nBethe-Salpeter equations with instantaneous three-preon interactions. The model\ncan be falsified by data from the Large Hadron Collider because it generates\nbaryon asymmetry without axions, and does not allow more than three generations\nof SM fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2008 21:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2010 20:01:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 22:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

However, the problem is\ncomputationally hard; as a result, virtually all the existing pipelines use\nfast but approximate scoring functions, in spite of the fact that they have\nbeen shown to systematically produce incorrect results. A few interesting exact\napproaches are known, but they are very slow and hence not practical in the\ncase of realistic sequences. Results: We give an exact solution, solely based\non deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs), to the problem of finding not\nonly the p-value, but the whole relevant part of the Markovian probability\ndistribution function of a motif in a biological sequence. In particular, the\ntime complexity of the algorithm in the most interesting regimes is far better\nthan that of Nuel (2006), which was the fastest similar exact algorithm known\nto date; in many cases, even approximate methods are outperformed. Conclusions:\nDFAs are a standard tool of computer science for the study of patterns, but so\nfar they have been sparingly used in the study of biological motifs. Previous\nworks do propose algorithms involving automata, but there they are used\nrespectively as a first step to build a Finite Markov Chain Imbedding (FMCI),\nor to write a generating function: whereas we only rely on the concept of DFA\nto perform the calculations.

In the high SNR regime we obtain a\nclosed-form expression for the end-to-end distortion as a function of the\noptimal point on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff curve.

We assume an equilibrium\nconfiguration with a transverse magnetic field to the slab axis and investigate\nwave damping by thermal conduction and radiative losses. The differential MHD\nequations that govern linear slow and fast modes are numerically solved to\nobtain the complex oscillatory frequency and the corresponding eigenfunctions.\nWe find that coronal thermal conduction and radiative losses from the\nprominence plasma reveal as the most relevant damping mechanisms. Both\nmechanisms govern together the attenuation of hybrid modes, whereas prominence\nradiation is responsible for the damping of internal modes and coronal\nconduction essentially dominates the attenuation of external modes. In\naddition, the energy transfer between the prominence and the corona caused by\nthermal conduction has a noticeable effect on the wave stability, radiative\nlosses from the prominence plasma being of paramount importance for the thermal\nstability of fast modes. We conclude that slow modes are efficiently damped,\nwith damping times compatible with observations.

The\nusual evaluation of such $p$-values is by simulations, and such simulations do\nverify that the global distribution of the $p$-values is uniform(0, 1), to high\naccuracy in repeated sampling. The derivation of the $p$-values, however,\nasserts a stronger statement, that they have a uniform(0, 1) distribution\nconditionally, given identified precision information provided by the data. We\ntake a simple regression example that involves exact precision information and\nuse large sample techniques to extract highly accurate information as to the\nstatistical position of the data point with respect to the parameter:\nspecifically, we examine various $p$-values and Bayesian posterior survivor\n$s$-values for validity. With observed data we numerically evaluate the various\n$p$-values and $s$-values, and we also record the related general formulas. We\nthen assess the numerical values for accuracy using Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(McMC) methods. We also propose some third-order likelihood-based procedures\nfor obtaining means and variances of Bayesian posterior distributions, again\nfollowed by McMC assessment. Finally we propose some adaptive McMC methods to\nimprove the simulation acceptance rates. All these methods are based on\nasymptotic analysis that derives from the effect of additional data. And the\nmethods use simple calculations based on familiar maximizing values and related\ninformations.

In this way the formalism is\nnaturally extended from tangential planes for the source and lensed images to\ncomplete spheres. We derive the lensing potential theory on the sphere and find\nthat the Poisson equation is modified by an additional source term that is\nrelated to the mean density and to the Newtonian potential at the positions of\nobserver and source. This new term generally reduces the magnification, to\nbelow unity far from the optical axis, and ensures conservation of the total\nphoton number received on a sphere around the source.\n  This discussion does not affect the validity of the 'focusing theorem', in\nwhich the unlensed situation is defined to have an unchanged affine distance\nbetween source and observer. The focusing theorem does not contradict flux\nconservation, because the mean total magnification directly corresponds to\ndifferent areas of the source sphere in the lensed and unlensed situation. We\nargue that a constant affine distance does not define an astronomically\nmeaningful reference.\n  By exchanging source and observer, we confirm that magnification and\namplification differ according to Etherington's reciprocity law, so that\nsurface brightness is no longer strictly conserved.

In this article I use numerical experiments to model the consequences\nof those phenomena on the observed color-magnitude diagrams and the IMFs\nderived from them. Real multiple systems affect the observed or apparent\nmassive-star MF slope little but can create a significant population of\napparently ultramassive stars. Chance superpositions produce only small biases\nwhen the number of superimposed stars is low but, once a certain number\nthreshold is reached, they can affect both the observed slope and the apparent\nstellar upper mass limit. I apply those experiments to two well known massive\nyoung clusters in the Local Group, NGC 3603 and R136. In both cases I show that\nthe observed population of stars with masses above 120 solar masses can be\nexplained by the effects of unresolved objects, mostly real multiple systems\nfor NGC 3603 and a combination of real and chance-alignment multiple systems\nfor R136. Therefore, the case for the reality of a stellar upper mass limit at\nsolar or near-solar metallicities is strengthened, with a possible value even\nlower than 150 solar masses. An IMF slope somewhat flatter than Salpeter or\nKroupa with gamma between -1.6 and -2.0 is derived for the central region of\nNGC 3603, with a significant contribution to the uncertainty arising from the\nimprecise knowledge of the distance to the cluster.

Assuming that the\nclassical MDS conjecture holds, we are able to classify all self-dual additive\nMDS codes over GF(9) by using an extension technique. We prove that the minimum\ndistance of a self-dual additive code is related to the minimum vertex degree\nin the associated graph orbit.

Divergences and mode couplings\nhave thus been underscored within the rotating frame and in order to simplify\nunderstanding of all these phenomena, the dofs of the beams will first be\ntreated separately and then together. The dynamics of radial rotating loads on\nan elastic ring can create divergence instabilities as well as post-critical\nmode couplings. Moreover, the flexural motion of beam rubbing on the ring can\nalso lead to mode couplings and to the locus-veering phenomenon. The presence\nof rubbing seems to make the system unstable as soon as the rotational speed of\nthe beams is greater than zero. Lastly, the influence of an angle between the\nbeams and the normal to the ring's inner surface will be studied with respect\nto system stability, thus highlighting a shift frequency phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2008 14:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-28"}
