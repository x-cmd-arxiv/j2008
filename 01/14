The outward accessibility\nquantifies the potential of an individual node for accessing other nodes\nthrough random walks. The inward accessibility measures the potential of a\ngiven node of being accessed by other nodes. Both the inward and outward\naccessibilities are measured with respect to successive time steps along the\nwalks, providing an interesting means for the characterization of the transient\nnon-linear dynamics of accessibility.

We spatially resolved integrated spectra out to 0.6\n(NGC 1407) and 1.3 (NGC 1400) effective radii. The radial profiles of the\nkinematic parameters v(rot), sigma, h3 and h4 are measured. The surface\nbrightness profiles are fitted to different galaxy light models and the colour\ndistributions analysed. The multi-band images are modelled to derive isophotal\nshape parameters and residual galaxy images. The parameters from the surface\nbrightness profile fitting are used to estimate the mass of the possible\ncentral supermassive black hole in NGC 1407. The galaxies are found to be\nrotationally supported and to have a flat core in the surface brightness\nprofiles. Elliptical isophotes are observed at all radii and no fine structures\nare detected in the residual galaxy images. From our results we can also\ndiscard a possible interaction between NGC 1400, NGC 1407 and the group\nintergalactic medium. We estimate a mass of 1.03x10^9 M(sun) for the\nsupermassive black hole in NGC 1407 galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2008 03:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We consider a generalization of the Chaplygin gas model, by assuming\nthe presence of a bulk viscous type dissipative term in the effective\nthermodynamic pressure of the gas. The dissipative effects are described by\nusing the truncated Israel-Stewart model, with the bulk viscosity coefficient\nand the relaxation time functions of the energy density only. The corresponding\ncosmological dynamics of the bulk viscous Chaplygin gas dominated universe is\nconsidered in detail for a flat homogeneous isotropic\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry. For different values of the model\nparameters we consider the evolution of the cosmological parameters (scale\nfactor, energy density, Hubble function, deceleration parameter and luminosity\ndistance, respectively), by using both analytical and numerical methods. In the\nlarge time limit the model describes an accelerating universe, with the\neffective negative pressure induced by the Chaplygin gas and the bulk viscous\npressure driving the acceleration. The theoretical predictions of the\nluminosity distance of our model are compared with the observations of the type\nIa supernovae. The model fits well the recent supernova data. From the fitting\nwe determine both the equation of state of the Chaplygin gas, and the\nparameters characterizing the bulk viscosity. The evolution of the scalar field\nassociated to the viscous Chaplygin fluid is also considered, and the\ncorresponding potential is obtained.

We\ninvestigate the possibility of such an earlier formation of dust grains in the\nexpanding ejecta of SN 2006jc, applying the Type Ib SN model that is developed\nto reproduce the observed light curve. We find that the rapid decrease of the\ngas temperature in SN 2006jc enables the condensation of C grains in the C-rich\nlayer at 40-60 days after the explosion, which is followed by the condensation\nof silicate and oxide grains until ~200 days.

To this\npurpose, we introduce two extra principles to the thermodynamic ones, which are\n(mathematically) compatible with the traditional principles, but have no\nmeaning in inert matter. A traditional balance equation for metabolism will be\nthen extended to the new notion as specified by these principles. We consider\nfar from equilibrium systems and we focus in particular on the production of\nglobal entropy associated to the irreversible character of the processes. A\nclose analysis of this term will be carried on, both in terms of a diffusion\nequation of biomass over complexity and, as a complementary approach and as a\ntool for specifying a source term, in connection to Schroedinger's method for\nhis equation in Quantum Mechanics. We borrow from this equation just the\noperatorial approach and, this, in a classical frame, as we use real\ncoefficients instead of complex ones, away thus from the mathematical frame of\nquantum theories. The first application of our proposal is a simple\nmathematical reconstruction of Gould's complexity curve of biomass over\ncomplexity, as for evolution.

On the grounds of this approach, we analyze\nmetabolism and scaling laws. This allows to compare various relevant\ncoefficients appearing in these scaling laws, which seem to fit empirical data.\nFinally, a tentative and quantitative evaluation of complexity is proposed,\nalso in relation to some empirical data (caenorhabditis elegans).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2008 10:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-15"}

The latter provides a mechanism\nof sharing the initial high momentum of the photon by the outgoing two\nnucleons. Within HRM we discuss hard break-up reactions involving $^2D$ and\n$^3He$ targets. Another development of HRM is the prediction of new helicity\nselection mechanism for hard two-body reactions, which was apparently confirmed\nin the recent JLab experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2008 12:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

The equations\nrepresenting evolutions of these media are irregular through geometrical\nmanifolds. A unique continuous medium is conceptually simpler than several\nmedia with surfaces of singularity. To avoid the surfaces of discontinuity in\nthe theory, we transform the model by considering a continuous medium taking\nintoaccount more complete internal energies expressed in gradient developments\nassociated with the variables of state. Nevertheless, resulting equations of\nmotion are of an higher order than those of the classical models: they lead to\nnon-linear models associated with more complex integration processes on the\nmathematical level as well as on the numerical point of view. In fact, such\nmodels allow a precise study of singular zones when they have a non negligible\nphysical thickness. This is typically the case for capillarity phenomena in\nfluids or mixtures of fluids in which interfacial zones are transition layers\nbetween phases or layers between fluids and solid walls.
