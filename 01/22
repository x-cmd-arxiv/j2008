However,\nthe direct measurement of coronal magnetic fields is not possible with present\nmethods, and therefore the coronal field has to be extrapolated from\nphotospheric measurements. Due to the low plasma beta the coronal magnetic\nfield can usually be assumed to be approximately force free, with electric\ncurrents flowing along the magnetic field lines. There are both observational\nand theoretical reasons which suggest that at least prior to an eruption the\ncoronal magnetic field is in a nonlinear force free state. Unfortunately the\ncomputation of nonlinear force free fields is way more difficult than potential\nor linear force free fields and analytic solutions are not generally available.\nWe discuss several methods which have been proposed to compute nonlinear force\nfree fields and focus particularly on an optimization method which has been\nsuggested recently.

Although only ~25\nmultiple planet systems have been discovered to date, our analyses in these\nterms have revealed several important features of planetary interactions. 1)\nMany systems interact such that they are near the boundary between stability\nand instability. 2) Planets tend to form such that at least one planet's\neccentricity periodically drops to near zero. 3) Mean-motion resonant pairs\nwould be unstable if not for the resonance. 4) Scattering of approximately\nequal mass planets is unlikely to produce the observed distribution of apsidal\nbehavior. 5) Resonant interactions may be identified through calculating a\nsystem's proximity to instability, regardless of knowledge of angles such as\nmean longitude and longitude of periastron (e.g. GJ 317 b and c are probably in\na 4:1 resonance). These properties of planetary systems have been identified\nthrough calculation of two parameters that describe the interaction. The\napsidal interaction can be quantified by determining how close a planet is to\nan apsidal separatrix (a boundary between qualitatively different types of\napsidal oscillations, e.g. libration or circulation of the major axes). The\nproximity to instability can be measured by comparing the observed orbital\nelements to an analytic boundary that describes a type of stability known as\nHill stability.

The existence of such large-scale shocks in clusters\nof galaxies as inferred by high-resolution X-ray and radio imaging observations\nimplies large-scale systematic flows that are beyond usual static models for\nclusters of galaxies. Here, we explore self-similar two-fluid flow solutions\nwith shocks for a hot polytropic gas flow in a cluster of galaxies in the\npresence of a massive dark matter (DM) flow after the initiation of a\ngravitational core collapse or a central AGN activity or a large-scale merging\nprocess. In particular, the possibility of DM shocks or sharp jumps of mass\ndensity and of velocity dispersion in dark matter halo is discussed and such DM\nshocks might be detectable through gravitational lensing effects. To examine\nvarious plausible scenarios for clusters of galaxies, we describe three\npossible classes of shock flows within our model framework for different types\nof temperature, density and flow speed profiles. Depending upon sensible model\nparameters and shock locations, the hot ICM and DM halo may have various\ncombinations of asymptotic behaviours of outflow, breeze, inflow, contraction\nor static envelopes at large radii at a given time.

We introduce quasi-local (QL) variables that are covariant LTB\nobjects satisfying evolution equations of Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\n(FLRW) cosmologies. We prove rigorously that relative deviations of the local\ncovariant scalars from the QL scalars are non-linear, gauge invariant and\ncovariant perturbations on a FLRW formal \"background\" given by the QL scalars.\nThe dynamics of LTB spacetimes is completely determined by the QL scalars and\nthese exact perturbations. Since LTB spacetimes are compatible with a wide\nvariety of \"equations of state\", either single fluids or mixtures, a large\nnumber of known solutions with dark matter and dark energy sources in a FLRW\nframework (or with linear perturbations) can be readily examined under\nidealized but non-trivial inhomogeneous conditions. Coordinate choices and\ninitial conditions are derived for a numerical treatment of the perturbation\nequations, allowing us to study non-linear effects in a variety of phenomena,\nsuch as gravitational collapse, non-local effects, void formation, dark matter\nand dark energy couplings and particle creation. In particular, the embedding\nof inhomogeneous regions can be performed by a smooth matching with a suitable\nFLRW solution, thus generalizing the Newtonian \"top hat\" models that are widely\nused in astrophysical literature.

We explore universal conductance\nfluctuations in mesoscopic (Ga,Mn)As wires and rings, the Aharonov-Bohm effect\nin nanoscale rings and weak localization in arrays of wires, made of the\nferromagnetic semiconductor material. The experiments allow to probe the phase\ncoherence length L_phi and the spin flip length L_SO as well as the temperature\ndependence of dephasing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2008 13:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

By that it is meant a new investigation that includes several\nextensions of the traditional framework of Doplicher, Haag and Roberts in local\nquantum theories. At first we generalize the notion of representations of nets\nof C*-algebras, then we provide a brand new view on selection criteria by\nadopting one with a strong topological flavour. We prove that it is coherent\nwith the older point of view, hence a clue to a genuine extension. In this\nlight, we extend Roberts' cohomological analysis to the case where 1--cocycles\nbear non trivial unitary representations of the fundamental group of the\nspacetime, equivalently of its Cauchy surface in case of global hyperbolicity.\nA crucial tool is a notion of group von Neumann algebras generated by the\n1-cocycles evaluated on loops over fixed regions. One proves that these group\nvon Neumann algebras are localized at the bounded region where loops start and\nend and to be factorial of finite type I. All that amounts to a new invariant,\nin a topological sense, which can be defined as the dimension of the factor. We\nprove that any 1-cocycle can be factorized into a part that contains only the\ncharge content and another where only the topological information is stored.\nThis second part resembles much what in literature are known as geometric\nphases. Indeed, by the very geometrical origin of the 1-cocycles that we\ndiscuss in the paper, they are essential tools in the theory of net bundles,\nand the topological part is related to their holonomy content.

By averaging ensembles of\nexperimentally-obtained force networks in different ways, we compare the\nobserved behavior with various predictions for granular silos. We identify\nseveral differences between the mean behavior in our system and that predicted\nby Janssen-like models: We find that the redirection parameter describing how\nthe force network transfers vertical forces to the walls varies with depth. We\nfind that changes in the preparation of the material can cause the pressure\nwithin the silo to either saturate or to continue building with depth. Most\nstrikingly, we observe a non-linear response to overloads applied to the top of\nthe material in the silo. For larger overloads we observe the previously\nreported \"giant overshoot\" effect where overload pressure decays only after an\ninitial increase [G. Ovarlez et al., Phys. Rev. E 67, 060302(R) (2003)]. For\nsmaller overloads we find that additional pressure propagates to great depth.\nThis effect depends on the particle stiffness, as given for instance by the\nYoung's modulus, E, of the material from which the particles are made.\nImportant measures include E, the unscreened hydrostatic pressure, and the\napplied load. These experiments suggest that when the load and the particle\nweight are comparable, particle elasticity acts to stabilize the force network,\nallowing non-linear network effects to be seen in the mean behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2008 15:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-23"}
