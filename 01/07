Typical kick velocities\n(v_k) can exceed the sound speed in a circumbinary gas disk. While the inner\ndisk is strongly bound to the recoiling binary, the outer disk is only weakly\nbound or unbound. This leads to differential motions in the disturbed disk that\nincrease with radius and can become supersonic at ~700 Schwarzschild radii for\nv_k ~500 km/s, implying that shocks form beyond this radius. We indeed find\nthat kicks in the disk plane lead to immediate strong density enhancements\n(within weeks) in a tightly wound spiral caustic, propagating outward at the\nspeed v_k. Concentric density enhancements are also observed for kicks\nperpendicular to the disk, but are weaker and develop into caustics only after\na long delay (>1 year). Unless both BH spins are low or precisely aligned with\nthe orbital angular momentum, a significant fraction (> several %) of kicks are\nsufficiently large and well aligned with the orbital plane for strong shocks to\nbe produced. The shocks could result in an afterglow whose characteristic\nphoton energy increases with time, from the UV (~10eV) to the soft X-ray\n(~100eV) range, between one month and one year after the merger.

On October 24, 2007 the periodic comet 17P/Holmes underwent an\nastonishing outburst that increased its apparent total brightness from\nmagnitude V\\sim17 up to V\\sim2.5 in roughly two days. We report on Wendelstein\n0.8 m telescope (WST) photometric observations of the early evolution stages of\nthe outburst. Aims. We studied the evolution of the structure morphology, its\nkinematic, and estimated the ejected dust mass. Methods. We analized 126 images\nin the BVRI photometric bands spread between 26/10/2007 and 20/11/2007. The\nbright comet core appeared well separated from that one of a quickly expanding\ndust cloud in all the data, and the bulk of the latter was contained in the\nfield of view of our instrument. The ejected dust mass was derived on the base\nof differential photometry on background stars occulted by the moving cloud.\nResults. The two cores were moving apart from each other at a relative\nprojected constant velocity of (9.87 +/- 0.07) arcsec/day (0.135 +/-0.001\nkm/sec). In the inner regions of the dust cloud we observed a linear increase\nin size at a mean constant velocity of (14.6+/-0.3) arcsec/day (0.200+/-0.004\nkm/sec). Evidence of a radial velocity gradient in the expanding cloud was also\nfound.

We\ninterpreted our observations in the context of an explosive scenario which was\nmore probably originated by some internal instability processes, rather than an\nimpact with an asteroidal body.

The data provide new information on their circumstellar material as\nwell as their evolution. In IRC +10420, the polarization of the Halpha line is\ndifferent to that of the continuum, which indicates that the\nelectron-scattering region is not spherically symmetric. The observed long term\nchanges in the polarimetry can be associated with an axi-symmetric structure,\nalong the short axis of the extended reflection nebulosity. Long term\nphotometry reveals that the star increased in temperature until the\nmid-nineties, after which the photospheric flux in the optical levelled off. As\nthe photometric changes are mostly probed in the red, they do not trace high\nstellar temperatures sensitively. And so, it is not obvious whether the star\nhas halted its increase in temperature or not. For HD 179821 we find no\npolarization effects across any absorption or emission lines, but observe very\nlarge polarization changes of order 5% over 15 years. Unexpectedly, during the\nsame period, the optical photometry displayed modest variability at the 0.2\nmagnitude level. Several explanations for this puzzling fact are discussed.\nMost of which, involving asymmetries in the circumstellar material, seem to\nfail as there is no evidence for the presence of hot, dusty material close to\nthe star. Alternatively, the variations can be explained by the presence of a\nnon-radially pulsating photosphere. Changes in the photometry hint at an\nincrease in temperature corresponding to a change through two spectral\nsubclasses over the past ten years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2008 17:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This flare has previously\nbeen studied in great detail, with observations classifying it as a type 1\nwhite-light flare with a very hard spectrum in hard X-rays. The flare was also\nassociated with a type II radio burst and coronal mass ejection. The flare\nemission characteristics appeared to closely correspond with previous instances\nof seismic emission from acoustically active flares. Using standard local\nhelioseismic methods, we identified the seismic signatures produced by the\nflare that, to date, is the least energetic (in soft X-rays) of the flares\nknown to have generated a detectable acoustic transient. Holographic analysis\nof the flare shows a compact acoustic source strongly correlated with the\nimpulsive hard X-ray, visible continuum, and radio emission. Time-distance\ndiagrams of the seismic waves emanating from the flare region also show faint\nsignatures, mainly in the eastern sector of the active region. The strong\nspatial coincidence between the seismic source and the impulsive visible\ncontinuum emission reinforces the theory that a substantial component of the\nseismic emission seen is a result of sudden heating of the low photosphere\nassociated with the observed visible continuum emission. Furthermore, the\nlow-altitude magnetic loop structure inferred from potential--field\nextrapolations in the flaring region suggests that there is a significant\ninverse correlation between the seismicity of a flare and the height of the\nmagnetic loops that conduct the particle beams from the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2008 03:01:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2008 05:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive\nthe first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald. Going\nbeyond the point particle approximation, to account for the finite size of the\nobject, we demonstrate that for extreme mass ratio inspirals the motion of a\ncompact object is affected by tidally induced moments at $O(\\epsilon^4)$, in\nthe form of an Effacement Principle. The relatively large radius-to-mass ratio\nof a white dwarf star allows for these effects to be enhanced until the white\ndwarf becomes tidally disrupted, a potentially $O(\\epsilon^2)$ process, or\nplunges into the supermassive black hole.

Recently, a new class of\ntopological insulators has been proposed. These topological insulators have an\ninsulating gap in the bulk, but have topologically protected edge states due to\nthe time reversal symmetry. In two dimensions the helical edge states give rise\nto the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, in the absence of any external magnetic\nfield. Here we review a recent theory which predicts that the QSH state can be\nrealized in HgTe/CdTe semiconductor quantum wells. By varying the thickness of\nthe quantum well, the band structure changes from a normal to an \"inverted\"\ntype at a critical thickness $d_c$. We present an analytical solution of the\nhelical edge states and explicitly demonstrate their topological stability. We\nalso review the recent experimental observation of the QSH state in\nHgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We review both the fabrication of the sample and\nthe experimental setup. For thin quantum wells with well width $d_{QW}< 6.3$\nnm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly small\nconductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells ($d_{QW}>\n6.3$ nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual\nconductance close to $2e^2/h$. The residual conductance is independent of the\nsample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the\nresidual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The\nquantum phase transition at the critical thickness, $d_c= 6.3$ nm, is also\nindependently determined from the occurrence of a magnetic field induced\ninsulator to metal transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2008 05:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our\nprimary focus is on non-thermal Bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering,\nthat produce hard X-ray emission. We briefly review acceleration mechanisms and\npoint out that in most astrophysical situations, and in particular for the\nintracluster medium, shocks, turbulence and plasma waves play a crucial role.\nWe consider two scenarios for production of non-thermal radiation. The first is\nhard X-ray emission due to non-thermal Bremsstrahlung by nonrelativistic\nparticles. Non-thermal tails are produced by accelerating electrons from the\nbackground plasma with an initial Maxwellian distribution. However, these tails\nare accompanied by significant heating and they are present for a short time of\n<10^6 yr, which is also the time that the tail will be thermalised. Such\nnon-thermal tails, even if possible, can only explain the hard X-ray but not\nthe radio emission which needs GeV or higher energy electrons. For these and\nfor production of hard X-rays by the inverse Compton model, we need the second\nscenario where there is injection and subsequent acceleration of relativistic\nelectrons. It is shown that a steady state situation, for example arising from\nsecondary electrons produced from cosmic ray proton scattering by background\nprotons, will most likely lead to flatter than required electron spectra or it\nrequires a short escape time of the electrons from the cluster. An episodic\ninjection of relativistic electrons, presumably from galaxies or AGN, and/or\nepisodic generation of turbulence and shocks by mergers can result in an\nelectron spectrum consistent with observations but for only a short period of\nless than one billion years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2008 15:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The secondary users, however, need to adjust their protocol based on\nknowledge about the locations of the primary nodes to bring little loss to the\nprimary network's throughput. By introducing preservation regions around\nprimary receivers and avoidance regions around primary base stations, we\npropose two modified multihop routing protocols for the cognitive users. Base\non percolation theory, we show that when the secondary network is denser than\nthe primary network, both networks can simultaneously achieve the same\nthroughput scaling law as a stand-alone network. Furthermore, the primary\nnetwork throughput is subject to only a vanishingly fractional loss.\nSpecifically, for the ad hoc and the infrastructure-supported primary models,\nthe primary network achieves sum throughputs of order $n^{1/2}$ and\n$\\max\\{n^{1/2},l\\}$, respectively. For both primary network models, for any\n$\\delta>0$, the secondary network can achieve sum throughput of order\n$m^{1/2-\\delta}$ with an arbitrarily small fraction of outage. Thus, almost all\nsecondary source-destination pairs can communicate at a rate of order\n$m^{-1/2-\\delta}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2008 10:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 05:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The models are also used to predict H2O spectral\nline emission for the upcoming Herschel/HIFI mission.\n  Methods: We use Infrared space observatory long wavelength spectrometer\nspectra to constrain the circumstellar fractional abundance distribution of\northo-H2O, using a non-local thermal equilibrium, and non-local, radiative\ntransfer code based on the accelerated lambda iteration formalism. The\nmass-loss rates and kinetic temperature structures for the sample stars are\ndetermined through radiative transfer modelling of CO line emission based on\nthe Monte-Carlo method. The density and temperature profiles of the\ncircumstellar dust grains are determined through spectral energy distribution\nmodelling using the publicly available code Dusty.\n  Results: The determined ortho-H2O abundances lie between 1e-4 and 1.5e-3\nrelative to H2, with the exception of WX Psc, which has a much lower estimated\northo-H2O abundance of only 2e-6, possibly indicating H_2O adsorption onto dust\ngrains or recent mass-loss-rate modulations.

This prediction is relatively insensitive to the details of baryonic\nphysics or cosmological parameters. In particular, if the fstar-M500 relation\nis fixed and does not evolve with redshift, CDM models predict the logarithmic\nslope of this relation to be b>-0.3. This constraint can be weakened if the\nfstar-M500 relation evolves strongly, but this implies more stars must be\nformed in situ in groups at low redshift. Conservatively requiring that at\nleast half the stars in groups were formed by z=1, the constraint from\nevolution models is b>-0.35. Since the most massive clusters (M500=1E15 Msun)\nare observed to have fstar=0.01, this means that groups with M500=5E13 Msun\nmust have fstar<0.03. Recent observations by Gonzalez et al. (2007) indicate a\nmuch steeper relation, with fstar>0.04 in groups, leading to b=-0.64. If\nconfirmed, this would rule out hierarchical structure formation models: today's\nclusters could not have been built from today's groups, or even from the\nhigher-redshift progenitors of those groups. We perform a careful analysis of\nthese and other data to identify the most important systematic uncertainties in\ntheir measurements. Although correlated uncertainties on stellar and total\nmasses might explain the steep observed relation, the data are only consistent\nwith theory if the observed group masses are systematically underestimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2008 14:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\neffect of spin-injection is to modify locally, in the ferromagnetic\nconfiguration space, the density of magnetic moments. The corresponding\ngradient leads to a current-dependent diffusion process of the magnetization.\nIn order to describe this effect, the dynamics of the magnetization of a\nferromagnetic single domain is reconsidered in the framework of the\nthermokinetic theory of mesoscopic systems. Assuming an Onsager\ncross-coefficient that couples the currents, it is shown that spin-dependent\nelectric transport leads to a correction of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nequation of the ferromagnetic order parameter with supplementary diffusion\nterms. The consequence of spin-injection in terms of activation process of the\nferromagnet is deduced, and the expressions of the effective energy barrier and\nof the critical current are derived. Magnetic fluctuations are calculated: the\ncorrection to the fluctuations is similar to that predicted for the activation.\nThese predictions are consistent with the measurements of spin-transfer\nobtained in the activation regime and for ferromagnetic resonance under\nspin-injection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2008 15:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Although standard secondary phases can\nusually be ruled out, it is less clear whether regions with high Co\nconcentration coexist with undoped portions of the film, i.e. whether some form\nof CoO polymorph can be responsible for the magnetic signal. Since X-ray\nusually excludes the presence of the native rock-salt phase, the study of CoO\npolymorphs becomes particularly interesting. In this work we investigate\ntheoretically the magnetism of CoO in both the wurtzite and zincblende phases.\nBy using a combination of density functional theory with the LDA+$U$\napproximation and Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate that wurtzite and\nzincblende CoO have a complex frustrated anti-ferromagnetic ground state with\nno net magnetic moment in the bulk. Most importantly the estimated critical\ntemperatures are well below room temperature for both cases. This suggests that\nbulk CoO polymorphs are not responsible for the room temperature magnetism\nobserved for ZnO:Co, although the role of clusters with uncompensated spins or\narranged in a spinodal decomposed structure still remains an open question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2008 15:33:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2008 12:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-01"}
