Using\nconstant-composition random codes, we propose a generalization of Csiszar and\nKorner's Maximum Mutual Information decoder with erasure option for discrete\nmemoryless channels. The new decoder is parameterized by a weighting function\nthat is designed to optimize the fundamental tradeoff between undetected-error\nand erasure exponents for a compound class of channels. The class of weighting\nfunctions may be further enlarged to optimize a similar tradeoff for list\ndecoders -- in that case, undetected-error probability is replaced with average\nnumber of incorrect messages in the list.

With\nincreasing pT, the away-side Delta phi distribution evolves from a broad and\nrelatively flat shape to a concave shape, then to a convex shape. Comparisons\nto p+p data suggest that the away-side distribution can be divided into a\npartially suppressed head region centered at Delta phi ~ \\pi, and an enhanced\nshoulder region centered at Delta phi ~ \\pi \\pm 1:1. The pT spectrum for the\nassociated hadrons in the head region softens toward central collisions. The\nspectral slope for the shoulder region is independent of centrality and trigger\npT . The properties of the near-side distributions are also modified relative\nto those in p + p collisions, reflected by the broadening of the jet shape in\nDelta phi and Delta eta, and an enhancement of the per-trigger yield. However,\nthese modifications seem to be limited to pT < 4 GeV/c, above which both the\ndihadron pair shape and per-trigger yield become similar to p + p collisions.\nThese observations suggest that both the away- and near-side distributions\ncontain a jet fragmentation component which dominates for pT \\ge 5GeV and a\nmedium-induced component which is important for pT \\le 4 GeV/c.

In graphene monolayers, the 1/f noise is found to follow\nHooge's empirical relation with a noise parameter comparable to that of bulk\nsemiconductors. However, this 1/f noise is strongly suppressed in bilayer\ngraphene devices, and exhibits an unusual dependence on the carrier density,\ndifferent from most other materials. The unexpected noise behavior in graphene\nbilayers is associated with its unique band structure that varies with the\ncharge distribution among the two layers, resulting in an effective screening\nof potential fluctuations due to external impurity charges. The findings here\npoint to exciting opportunities for graphene bilayers in low-noise\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2008 22:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-29"}

These \"peculiar DQ bands\" have been attributed to a hydrocarbon such as\nC_2H. We point out that C_2H does not show strong absorption bands with\nwavelengths matching those of the peculiar DQ bands and neither does any other\nsimple molecule or ion likely to be present in a cool WD atmosphere. The most\nstraightforward explanation for the peculiar DQ bands is that they are\npressure-shifted Swan bands of C_2.

We used\nVLA-D 3.6-cm continuum, ground-based, and HST-archive imaging as well as long\nslit high- and low-dispersion spectroscopy. The low-dispersion spectra indicate\na high excitation nebula, with low to medium variations of its internal\nphysical conditions. In the optical images, the point-symmetric knots show a\nlack of [NII] emission as compared with similar features previously known in\nother PNe. A rich internal structure of the central region is seen in the HST\nimages, resembling a deformed torus. Long slit high-dispersion spectra reveal a\ncomplex kinematics in the central region. The spectral line profiles from the\nexternal regions of NGC 6309 indicate expanding lobes (~40 km/s) as those\ngenerally found in bipolar nebulae. Finally, we have found evidence for the\npresence of a faint halo, possibly related to the envelope of the AGB-star\nprogenitor. Our data indicate that NGC 6309 is a quadrupolar nebula with two\npairs of bipolar lobes whose axes are oriented PA=40 and PA=76. Equatorial and\npolar velocities for these two pairs of lobes are 29 and 86 km/s for the\nbipolar system at PA=40 and 25 and 75 km/s for the bipolar system at PA=76.\nThere is also a central torus that is expanding at 25 km/s. Kinematical age for\nall these structures is around 3700 to 4000 yr. We conclude that NGC 6309 was\nformed by a set of well-collimated bipolar outflows (jets), which were ejected\nin the initial stages of its formation as a planetary nebula. These jets carved\nthe bipolar lobes in the previous AGB wind and their remnants are now observed\nas the point-symmetric knots tracing the edges of the lobes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2008 04:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In order to analyse influence of the magnetic\ndisorder on spin wave dispersion relations, the special case of volume and\nsurface spin waves in the Damon-Eshbach (DE) geometry in films with magnetic\ndisorder is considered. It is revealed strong influence of the magnetic\ndisorder on surface spin waves, which consist of two branches -- the DE mode\nand the longitudinal spin wave mode. Decrease of the ordering parameters leads\nto a decrease of the initial frequency and the curve slope of the DE mode\ndispersion curve and to an increase of the dispersion curve slope of the\nlongitudinal mode. If the spin noncollinearity is high, then the DE mode\ndispersion assumes a curve with the backward character.

While divergence hugely\ndestabilises, slip dramatically stabilizes the linear mode. In a non-parallel\nstability analysis, we study a combination of these two effects, since both\nwill coexist in small-scale flows with wall roughness. Our main results are (i)\nthat the stabilising effect of slip is reversed at higher angles of divergence,\n(ii) transient growth of disturbances is unaffected by either wall-divergence,\nor by slip at any divergence. Moreover, at the Reynolds numbers relevant here,\ntransient growth is too low to be a significant player in transition to\nturbulence, which is more likely to be driven by linear instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2008 10:54:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 10:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-19"}

A way to do this is examined in this study. A bare\nmagnetic dipole containing a flux quantum spins stably, and produces an inverse\nsquare E= -vxB electric field similar to what one finds from charge. Gauss' law\nfinds charge in this model, though there be none. For stability, a current loop\nabout the waist of the magnetic dipole is needed and we must go beyond the\nclassical Maxwell's equations to find it. A spinning E field is equivalent to\nan electric displacement current. The sideways motion of the spinning E (of\nconstant magnitude) creates a little-recognized transverse electric\ndisplacement current about the waist. This differs from Maxwell's electric\ndisplacement current, in which E increases in magnitude. The sideways motion of\nE supports the dipolar B field, B=vxE/c^2. Beyond the very core of the magnetic\ndipole, each of these two velocities is essentially c and vxE/c^2 =\nvx(-vxB)/c^2 = B, the spinning E field wholly sourcing the dipolar B field. The\nanisotropy of the vxB field is cured by precession about an inclined axis.\nChoosing a Bohr magneton for the magnetic dipole and assuming it spins at the\nCompton frequency, Gauss' law finds Q = e. The vxB field, normally thought to\nbe solenoidal, becomes instead a conservative field in this model. Charge is\nrecognized as merely a mathematical construct, not fundamental but nevertheless\nuseful. With charge deleted, and with addition of the transverse electric\ndisplacement current, Maxwell's equations can be written in terms of the E and\nB fields alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2008 14:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-31"}
