Normally a second order discretization by space is applied while a\nfirst order by time is satisfactory. Nevertheless, in a number of different\nproblems, discretization both by temporal and by spatial variables is needed of\nhighest orders, which complicates numerical solution, in some cases\ndramatically.

We perform a search using\na Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to investigate model parameters and\nsparticle mass spectra which occur in Yukawa-unified SUSY models, where we also\nrequire the relic density of neutralino dark matter to saturate the\nWMAP-measured abundance.

Statistical entropy is\nthe logarithm of the number of microstates consistent with the observed\nmacroscopic properties of a system, hence a measure of uncertainty about its\nprecise state. Therefore, assuming unitarity in black hole evaporation, the\nstandard results suggest that the largest uncertainty in the future quantum\nstate of the universe is due to the Hawking radiation from evaporating black\nholes. However, the entropy of the matter precursors to astrophysical black\nholes is enormously less than that given by area entropy. If unitarity relates\nthe future radiation states to the black hole precursor states, then the\nstandard results are highly misleading, at least for an observer that can\ndifferentiate the individual states of the Hawking radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2008 22:43:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 20:24:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 May 2009 20:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

Here, we confirm the generality of this microscopic picture through\nanalysis, via molecular simulation and integral equation theory, of\ncoordination shell contributions to the two-body excess entropy for several\nrelated model fluids which incorporate different levels of molecular\nresolution. The results suggest that integral equation theory can be an\neffective and computationally inexpensive first-pass tool for assessing, based\non the pair potential alone, whether new model systems are good candidates for\nexhibiting structural (and hence thermodynamic and transport) anomalies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2008 23:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-11"}

In such cases, their high-energy spectral\nparameters (peak energy and high-energy power-law indices) cannot be adequately\nconstrained by BATSE LAD data alone. A few dozen bright BATSE GRBs were also\nobserved with EGRET's calorimeter, TASC, in multi-MeV energy band, with a large\neffective area and fine energy resolution. Combining the BATSE and TASC data,\ntherefore, affords spectra that span four decades of energy ($30 $keV$-200\n$MeV), allowing for a broadband spectral analysis with good statistics.\nStudying such broadband high-energy spectra of GRB prompt emission is crucial,\nas they provide key clues to understanding its gamma-ray emission mechanism.\nAmong the 15 GRB spectra, we found two cases with a significant high-energy\nexcess, and another case with a extremely high peak energy (\\epeak $\\gtrsim$\n170 MeV).

For the radiative\nstates of QW excitons, i.e., for radiative QW polaritons, the transition is\ndescribed as a qualitative change of the photoluminescence spectrum at grazing\nangles along the QW structure. Furthermore, we show that the radiative\ncorrections to the QW exciton states with in-plane wavevector approaching the\nphoton cone are universally scaled by an energy parameter rather than diverge.\nThe strong-weak coupling transition rates are also proportional to the same\nenergy parameter.
