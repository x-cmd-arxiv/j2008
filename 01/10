A simple experiment performed on a 3-terminal sample demonstrates\nthat quasiparticle current and supercurrent can coexist in the normal region of\nthe S/N/S junction. When larger voltages are applied to the normal reservoir,\nthe sign of the current-phase relation of the junction can be reversed,\ncreating a \"$\\pi$-junction.\" We compare quantitatively the maximum critical\ncurrents obtained in 4-terminal $\\pi$-junctions when the voltages on the normal\nreservoirs have the same or opposite sign with respect to the superconductors.\nWe discuss the challenges involved in creating a \"Zeeman\" $\\pi$-junction with a\nparallel applied magnetic field and show in detail how the orbital effect\nsuppresses the critical current. Finally, when normal current and supercurrent\nare simultaneously present in the junction, the distribution function develops\na spatially inhomogeneous component that can be interpreted as an effective\ntemperature gradient across the junction, with a sign that is controllable by\nthe supercurrent.

As a result, the band-power uncertainties have been\nreduced by more than a factor of two on angular scales encompassing the third\nto fifth acoustic peaks as well as the damping tail of the CMB power spectrum.\nThe calibration uncertainty has been reduced from 6% to 2.1% in temperature\nthrough a direct comparison of the CMB anisotropy measured by ACBAR with that\nof the dipole-calibrated WMAP5 experiment. The measured power spectrum is\nconsistent with a spatially flat, LambdaCDM cosmological model.

The preferred strength of the lensing is consistent with\ntheoretical expectations. On fine angular scales, there is weak evidence (1.1\nsigma) for excess power above the level expected from primary anisotropies.

Specializing to d = 1, we\ndecompose n into a direct sum of highest weight modules for sl_2, the\ncoefficients of which are given by a closed formula. Next, we observe that n\nhas a nontrivial center, which we link through the center C of the trace ring\nof couples of generic 2x2 matrices to the Poisson center of S(sl_2). The Lie\nalgebra structure of n induces a Poisson structure on C, the symplectic leaves\nof which we are able to describe as coadjoint orbits for the Lie group of the\nsemidirect product sl_2\\rtimes h of sl_2 with the Heisenberg Lie algebra h.\nFinally, we provide a link between double Poisson algebras on one hand and\nPoisson orders on the other hand, showing that all trace rings of a double\nPoisson algebra are Poisson orders over their center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2008 15:42:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2008 09:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-22"}

While accretion disk models driven by a generic turbulent viscosity\nhave been invoked as a means to explain such large-scale transport, the\ndetailed physics behind such an ``alpha'' viscosity remains unclear. We present\nhere an alternative physical mechanism for large-scale transport in the solar\nnebula: gravitational torques associated with the transient spiral arms in a\nmarginally gravitationally unstable disk, of the type that appears to be\nnecessary to form gas giant planets. Three dimensional models are presented of\nthe time evolution of self-gravitating disks, including radiative transfer and\ndetailed equations of state, showing that small dust grains will be transported\nupstream and downstream (with respect to the mean inward flow of gas and dust\nbeing accreted by the central protostar) inside the disk on time scales of less\nthan 1000 yr inside 10 AU. These models furthermore show that any initial\nspatial heterogeneities present (e.g., in short-lived isotopes such as 26Al)\nwill be homogenized by disk mixing down to a level of ~10%, preserving the use\nof short-lived isotopes as accurate nebular chronometers, while simultaneously\nallowing for the spread of stable oxygen isotope ratios. This finite level of\nnebular spatial heterogeneity appears to be related to the coarse mixing\nachieved by spiral arms, with radial widths of order 1 AU, over time scales of\n~1000 yrs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2008 15:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In addition, it addresses a question of direct practical\ninterest, namely the rate of energy dissipation. Unfortunately, only an upper\nbound is obtained as a larger functional space than the space of solutions to\nthe Navier-Stokes equations is searched. Yet, in general, this upper bound is\nin good agreement with experimental results in terms of order of magnitude and\npower law of the imposed Reynolds number. In this paper, the variational\napproach to turbulence is extended to the case of dynamo action and an upper\nbound is obtained for the global dissipation rate (viscous and Ohmic). A simple\nplane Couette flow is investigated. For low magnetic Prandtl number $P_m$\nfluids, the upper bound of energy dissipation is that of classical turbulence\n(i.e. proportional to the cubic power of the shear velocity) for magnetic\nReynolds numbers below $P_m^{-1}$ and follows a steeper evolution for magnetic\nReynolds numbers above $P_m^{-1}$ (i.e. proportional to the shear velocity to\nthe power four) in the case of electrically insulating walls. However, the\neffect of wall conductance is crucial : for a given value of wall conductance,\nthere is a value for the magnetic Reynolds number above which energy\ndissipation cannot be bounded. This limiting magnetic Reynolds number is\ninversely proportional to the square root of the conductance of the wall.\nImplications in terms of energy dissipation in experimental and natural dynamos\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2008 15:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 22:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
