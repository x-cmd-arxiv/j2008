For a < 0.2 AU,\neccentricities are much smaller (most e < 0.2), a characteristic widely\nattributed to damping by tides after the planets formed and the protoplanetary\ngas disk dissipated. Most previous estimates of the tidal damping considered\nthe tides raised on the planets, but ignored the tides raised on the stars.\nMost also assumed specific values for the planets' poorly constrained tidal\ndissipation parameter Qp. Perhaps most important, in many studies, the strongly\ncoupled evolution between e and a was ignored. We have now integrated the\ncoupled tidal evolution equations for e and a over the estimated age of each\nplanet, and confirmed that the distribution of initial e values of close-in\nplanets matches that of the general population for reasonable Q values, with\nthe best fits for stellar and planetary Q being ~10^5.5 and ~10^6.5,\nrespectively. The accompanying evolution of a values shows most close-in\nplanets had significantly larger a at the start of tidal migration. The earlier\ngas disk migration did not bring all planets to their current orbits. The\ncurrent small values of a were only reached gradually due to tides over the\nlifetimes of the planets.

In the first kind of experiments,\ncalcite monocrystals were indented at 40 degrees C for six weeks using ceramic\nindenters under stresses in the 50-200 MPa range in a saturated solution of\ncalcite and in a calcite-saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl. The deformation\n(depth of the hole below the indenter) is measured ex-situ at the end of the\nexperiment. In the second type of experiment, calcite monocrystals were\nindented by spherical glass indenters for 200 hours under stresses in the 0-100\nMPa range at room temperature in a saturated aqueous solution of calcite. The\ndisplacement of the indenter was continuously recorded using a specially\nconstructed differential dilatometer. The experiments conducted in a\ncalcite-saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl show an enhanced indentation rate\nowing to the fairly high solubility of calcite in this solution. In contrast,\nthe experiments conducted in a calcite-saturated aqueous solution show moderate\nindentation rate and the dry control experiments did not show any measurable\ndeformation. The rate of calcite indentation is found to be inversely\nproportional to the indenter diameter, thus indicating that the process is\ndiffusion-controlled. The microcracks in the dissolution region under the\nindenter dramatically enhance the rate of calcite indentation by a significant\nreduction of the distance of solute transport in the trapped fluid phase. This\nresult indicates that care should be taken in extrapolating the kinetic data of\npressure solution creep from one mineral to another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2008 19:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-07"}

Furthermore, the hypothesis that all periodic RV\nvariations are caused by companions is investigated by comparing their inferred\norbital statistics with the statistics of companions around main sequence\nstars. A strong relation is found between the amplitude of the RV variations\nand log g in K giant stars, as suggested earlier by Hatzes & Cochran (1998).\nHowever, most of the stars exhibiting periodic variations are located above\nthis relation. These RV variations can be split in a periodic component which\nis not correlated with log g and a random residual part which does correlate\nwith log g. Compared to main-sequence stars, K giants frequently exhibit\nperiodic RV variations. Interpreting these RV variations as being caused by\ncompanions, the orbital param eters are different from the companions orbiting\ndwarfs.

In the resonance\ntunneling regime, we find that for transverse-magnetic incident polarization,\nfield localization effects contribute to a waveguiding phenomenon that makes it\npossible for the light to remain confined within a small fraction of a\nwavelength, without any transverse boundaries, due to the suppression of\ndiffraction. This effect is related to negative refraction of the Poynting\nvector inside each metal layer, balanced by normal refraction inside the\nadjacent dielectric layer: The degree of field localization and material\ndispersion together determine the total momentum that resides within any given\nlayer, and thus the direction of energy flow. We find that the transport of\nevanescent wave vectors is mediated by the excitation of quasi-stationary, low\ngroup velocity surface waves responsible for relatively large losses. As\nrepresentative examples we consider transparent metallo-dielectric stacks such\nas Ag/TiO2 and Ag/GaP and show in detail how to obtain the optimum conditions\nfor high transmittance of both propagating and evanescent modes for\nsuper-guiding and super resolution applications across the visible and near IR\nranges. Finally, we study the influence of gain on super-resolution. We find\nthat the introduction of gain can compensate the losses caused by the\nexcitation of surface plasmons, improves the resolving characteristics of the\nlens, and leads to gain-tunable super-resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2008 21:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, the fact is still unclear because\nwhich may be cosmological redshift (including possibly the host galaxy redshift\nor the background galaxy redshift) or the redshift results from gravity of\nneutron star; in other words, GRB redshift may be related to its distance or\nnot. Here, I enumerate a series of evidences, including three methods, to\ndetermine whether the GRB distance does depend on the redshift. Firstly, the\ncorrelation analysis shows that there is no correlation between the fluence of\n131 GRBs (and the 1 s peak photon flux of 111 GRBs) and the redshift although\nthere is a significant correlation between the apparent magnitude of 32 hosts\nand the redshift. Secondly, from the number-redshift relation of GRBs and the\ndeductive reasoning, one can deduce an absurd conclusion that the probability\nof a nearby galaxy generating a GRB event would vary inversely as its distance\nsquare if GRB indeed comes from an external galaxy and the distance depends on\nthe redshift. Thirdly, if the distance is related to the redshift, then the\nvariables of fluence and peak flux definitely cannot be separated from the\nvariable of redshift in distribution functions of both the fluence-redshift and\nthe peak flux-redshift; while the variables separation tests show that they in\neffect do, and we then can exactly forecast the values of the fluence and the\npeak flux for the GRBs with redshift z > 4.5.
