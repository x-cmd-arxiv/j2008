This is a very surprising property, since individual Feynman\ndiagrams all diverge at infinite momentum. In this paper we give a simple\nphysical understanding of amplitudes in this limit, which corresponds to a hard\nparticle with (complex) light-like momentum moving in a soft background, and\ncan be conveniently studied using the background field method exploiting\nbackground light-cone gauge. An important role is played by enhanced spin\nsymmetries at infinite momentum--a single copy of a \"Lorentz\" group for gauge\ntheory and two copies for gravity--which together with Ward identities give a\nsystematic expansion for amplitudes at large momentum. We use this to study\ntree amplitudes in a wide variety of theories, and in particular demonstrate\nthat certain pure gauge and gravity amplitudes do vanish at infinity. Thus the\nBCFW recursion relations can be used to compute completely general gluon and\ngraviton tree amplitudes in any number of dimensions. We briefly comment on the\nimplications of these results for computing massive 4D amplitudes by KK\nreduction, as well understanding the unexpected cancelations that have recently\nbeen found in loop-level gravity amplitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2008 17:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

In this work we focus on a continuum\ndescription of this phenomenon by means of a generalized Cahn-Hilliard equation\n(GCH) with a proliferation term. As in the discrete model, there are two\ninteresting regimes. For subcritical adhesion, there are propagating \"pulled\"\nfronts, similarly to those of Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. The problem of front\nvelocity selection is examined, and our theoretical predictions are in a good\nagreement with a numerical solution of the GCH equation. For supercritical\nadhesion, there is a nontrivial transient behavior, where density profile\nexhibits a secondary peak. To analyze this regime, we investigated relaxation\ndynamics for the Cahn-Hilliard equation without proliferation. We found that\nthe relaxation process exhibits self-similar behavior. The results of continuum\nand discrete models are in a good agreement with each other for the different\nregimes we analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2008 21:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Future\nsurveys for extrasolar planets using the transit technique will also have\nsensitivity to detect these longer period planets. Orbital eccentricity affects\nthe detection of extrasolar planets using the transit technique in two opposing\nways: an enhancement in the probability for the planet to transit near\npericenter and a reduction in the detectability of the transit due to a shorter\ntransit duration. For an eccentricity distribution matching the currently known\nextrasolar planets with P>10 day, the probability for the planet to transit is\n~1.25 times higher than the equivalent circular orbit and the average transit\nduration is ~0.88 times shorter than the equivalent circular orbit. These two\nopposing effects nearly cancel for an idealized field transit survey with\nindependent photometric measurements that are dominated by Poisson noise. The\nnet effect is a modest ~4% increase in the transiting planet yield compared to\nassuming all planets have circular orbits. When intrinsic variability of the\nstar or correlated photometric measurements are the dominant source of noise,\nthe transit detectability is independent of the transit duration. In this case\nthe transit yield is ~25% higher than that predicted under the assumption of\ncircular orbits. Since the Kepler search for Earth-sized planets in the\nhabitable zone of a Solar-type star is limited by intrinsic variability, the\nKepler mission is expected to have a ~25% higher planet yield than that\npredicted for circular orbits if the Earth-sized planets have an orbital\neccentricity distribution similar to the currently known Jupiter-mass planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2008 22:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A phase-locking mechanism causes part of the second harmonic signal\ngenerated at the entry surface to become trapped and dragged along by the pump\nand to refract negatively, even though the index of refraction at the second\nharmonic frequency is positive. These circumstances culminate in the creation\nof an anomalous state consisting of a forward-moving second harmonic wave\npacket that has negative wave vector and momentum density, which in turn leads\nto non-specular reflections at intervening material interfaces. The\nforward-generated second harmonic signal trapped under the pump pulse\npropagates forward, but has all the attributes of a reflected pulse, similar to\nits twin counterpart generated at the surface and freely propagating backward\naway from the interface.

The DDF\nprotocol is well-known and has been analyzed in terms of the\nDiversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) in the infinite block length limit. We\ncharacterize the finite block length DMT and give new explicit code\nconstructions. The finite block length analysis illuminates a few key aspects\nthat have been neglected in the previous literature: 1) we show that one\ndominating cause of degradation with respect to the infinite block length\nregime is the event of decoding error at the relay; 2) we explicitly take into\naccount the fact that the destination does not generally know a priori the\nrelay decision time at which the relay switches from listening to transmit\nmode. Both the above problems can be tackled by a careful design of the\ndecoding algorithm. In particular, we introduce a decision rejection criterion\nat the relay based on Forney's decision rule (a variant of the Neyman-Pearson\nrule), such that the relay triggers transmission only when its decision is\nreliable. Also, we show that a receiver based on the Generalized Likelihood\nRatio Test rule that jointly decodes the relay decision time and the\ninformation message achieves the optimal DMT. Our results show that no cyclic\nredundancy check (CRC) for error detection or additional protocol overhead to\ncommunicate the decision time are needed for DDF.

In 1996, Diaconis surveyed this\nphenomenon, and asked how one could recognize its occurrence in families of\nfinite ergodic Markov chains. In 2004, the third author noted that a necessary\ncondition for cutoff in a family of reversible chains is that the product of\nthe mixing-time and spectral-gap tends to infinity, and conjectured that in\nmany settings, this condition should also be sufficient. Diaconis and\nSaloff-Coste (2006) verified this conjecture for continuous-time\nbirth-and-death chains, started at an endpoint, with convergence measured in\nseparation. It is natural to ask whether the conjecture holds for these chains\nin the more widely used total-variation distance.\n  In this work, we confirm the above conjecture for all continuous-time or lazy\ndiscrete-time birth-and-death chains, with convergence measured via\ntotal-variation distance. Namely, if the product of the mixing-time and\nspectral-gap tends to infinity, the chains exhibit cutoff at the maximal\nhitting time of the stationary distribution median, with a window of at most\nthe geometric mean between the relaxation-time and mixing-time.\n  In addition, we show that for any lazy (or continuous-time) birth-and-death\nchain with stationary distribution $\\pi$, the separation $1 - p^t(x,y)/\\pi(y)$\nis maximized when $x,y$ are the endpoints. Together with the above results,\nthis implies that total-variation cutoff is equivalent to separation cutoff in\nany family of such chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2008 08:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2008 23:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2008 06:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2008 16:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-06"}

The random contribution to collisions is such that the usual\ncollisional invariants of mass, momentum and energy do not hold pointwise, even\nif they all hold in the mean. Under this assumption it is shown that, while the\nBoltzmann equation has the usual conserved quantities, it possesses a steady\nstate with power-like tails for certain random variables. A similar situation\noccurs in kinetic models of economy recently considered by two of the authors\n[24], which are conservative in the mean but possess a steady distribution with\nPareto tails. The convolution-like gain operator is subsequently shown to have\ngood contraction/expansion properties with respect to different metrics in the\nset of probability measures. Existence and regularity of isotropic stationary\nstates is shown directly by constructing converging iteration sequences as done\nin [8]. Uniqueness, asymptotic stability and estimates of overpopulated high\nenergy tails of the steady profile are derived from the basic property of\ncontraction/expansion of metrics. For general initial conditions the solutions\nof the Boltzmann equation are then proved to converge with computable rate as t\ngoes to infinity to the steady solution in these distances, which metricizes\nthe weak convergence of measures. These results show that power-like tails in\nMaxwell models are obtained when the point-wise conservation of momentum and/or\nenergy holds only globally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2008 07:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-18"}

The effect of planetary\nmigration on the trapping of particles in mean motion resonances is found to be\nvery sensitive to the initial eccentricity of the planet and of the\nplanetesimals.
