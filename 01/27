The scheme includes one transmitter communicating to a remote\ndestination via two relays, which forward messages to the remote destination\nthrough reliable links with finite capacities. The relays receive the\ntransmission along with some unknown interference. We focus on three common\nsettings for distributed reception, wherein the scaling laws of the capacity\n(the pre-log as the power of the transmitter and the interference are taken to\ninfinity) are completely characterized. It is shown in most cases that in order\nto overcome the interference, a definite amount of information about the\ninterference needs to be forwarded along with the desired message, to the\ndestination. It is exemplified in one scenario that the cut-set upper bound is\nstrictly loose. The results are derived using the cut-set along with a new\nbounding technique, which relies on multi letter expressions. Furthermore,\nlattices are found to be a useful communication technique in this setting, and\nare used to characterize the scaling laws of achievable rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2008 12:47:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2009 22:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-08"}
