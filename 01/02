The effect of different\nligands and halogen atoms attached to PDI were studied to characterize the\nlight harvesting properties. The atomic size and electronegativity of the\nhalogen were observed to alter the relaxed molecular geometries which in turn\ninfluenced the electronic behavior of the dye molecules.

The diversity of walks starting at a\nspecific node $i$ is quantified in terms of a signature composed by the\nentropies of the node visit probabilities along each of the initial steps. Six\ntheoretical models of complex networks are considered: Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi,\nBarab\\'asi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, a geographical model, as well as two\nrecently introduced knitted networks formed by paths. The random walk diversity\nis explored at the level of network categories and of individual nodes.

Several interesting results are reported,\nincluding the facts that the transient diversity tends to increase with the\naverage degree for all considered network models and that the Watts and\nStrogatz and geographical models tend to yield diversity entropies which\nincrease more gradually with the number of steps, contrasting sharply with the\nsteep increases verified for the other four considered models.

This is an object $\\ip(X)$ with a morphism $i:X\\to\n\\ip(X)$ in such a way that $\\ip(X)$ is ``hyperbolic'' in a suitable sense and\n$i$ is as close as possible to be an isomorphism. Using the theory of model\ncategories, we found a definition of hyperbolic simplicial sheaf (for the\nstrong topology) that extends the classical one of Brody for complex spaces. We\nprove the existence of hyperbolic models for any simplicial sheaf. Furthermore,\nthe morphism $i$ can be taken to be a cofibration and an affine weak\nequivalence (in an algebraic setting, Morel and Voevodsky called it an $\\aff$\nweak equivalence). Imitating one possible definition of homotopy groups for a\ntopological space, we defined the {\\it holotopy} groups for a simplicial sheaf\nand showed that their vanishing in ``positive'' degrees is a necessary\ncondition for a sheaf to be hyperbolic. We deduce that if $X$ is a complex\nspace with a non zero holotopy group in positive degree, then its hyperbolic\nmodel (that in general will only be a simplicial sheaf) cannot be weakly\nequivalent to a hyperbolic complex space (in particular is not itself\nhyperbolic). We finish the manuscript by applying these results and a {\\it\ntopological realization functor}, constructed in the previous section, to prove\nthat the hyperbolic models of the complex projective spaces cannot be weakly\nequivalent to hyperbolic complex spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2008 15:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-03"}

This article reports recent progress in this regard. A survey is\npresented and then is followed by analytical approaches in terms of local bond\naverage (LBA) from the perspective of bonding energetics and its functional\ndependence on external stimuli of coordination environment and temperature\nchange. It is shown that the measurable quantities of a specimen can be\nfunctionally correlated to the identities of the representative bonds and their\nresponses to the external stimuli. It is understood that the shortened and\nstrengthened bonds between the under-coordinated atoms and the associated local\nstrain and energy trapping dictate intrinsically the mechanical behavior of\nsystems with large portion of under-coordinated atoms. The thermal softening of\na substance arises from thermally-induced bond expansion and lattice vibration\nthat weakens the bonds through the internal energy increase. The competition\nbetween the energy-density-gain and the residual atomic cohesive-energy in the\nrelaxed surface skin determines intrinsically the mechanical performance of a\nmesoscopic specimen, whereas competition between the activation and inhibition\nof atomic dislocations dominates extrinsically the yield strength of the\nspecimen in plastic deformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2008 15:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-03"}
