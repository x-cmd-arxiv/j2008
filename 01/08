While previous work has\nmainly been on Jc determined using induced or magnetization currents, the\npresent work utilizes transport current via an applied potential in strip\ngeometry. It is observed that the effect is not as pronounced using transport\ncurrent, probably due to a large difference in criterion voltage between the\ntwo types of measurements. However, when the films are narrowed by patterning\ninto 200-, 100-, or 80-micron, the hysteresis is clearly seen, because of the\nforcing of percolation across higher-angle grain boundaries.

In this\npaper we analyze and compare the effectiveness of different cooling techniques\nused for outdoor electronics. Various cooling techniques were compared like\nspecial coatings and paints on the outer surface, radiation shields,\ndouble-walled vented enclosures, fans for internal air circulation and\nair-to-air heat exchangers. A highly simplified, typical outdoor system was\nselected for this study measuring approximately 300x300x400 mm (WxLxH). Solar\nradiation was incident on 3 sides of the enclosure. There were 8 equally spaced\nPCBs inside the enclosure dissipating 12.5W each uniformly (100 watts total). A\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the system was built and analyzed.\nThis was followed by building a mock-up of the system and conducting\nexperiments to validate the CFD model. It was found that some of the simplest\ncooling techniques like white oil paint on the outer surface can significantly\nreduce the impact of solar loads. Adding internal circulation fans can also be\nvery effective.

Our results are consistent with the\nmerger/interaction origin of E+A galaxies, where the infalling-gas possibly\ncaused by a galaxy-galaxy merging creates a central-starburst, succeeded by a\npost-starburst (E+A) phase once the gas is depleted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2008 21:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We use this unique sample to determine, for\nthe first time, how accurately redshifts and other properties of massive\nhigh-redshift galaxies can be determined from broadband photometric data alone.\nWe find that the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our sample have a\nsystematic error of 0.08 and a random error of 0.13 in dz/(1+z). The systematic\nerror can be reduced by using optimal templates and deep photometry; the random\nerror, however, will be hard to reduce below 5%. The spectra lead to\nsignificantly improved constraints for stellar population parameters. For most\nquantities this improvement is about equally driven by the higher spectral\nresolution and by the much reduced redshift uncertainty.

We find mu_alpha\n= -11.7+/-0.4+/-0.5 mas/yr and mu_delta = +4.2+/-0.4+/-0.5 mas/yr relative to\nthe pulsar's standard of rest, where the two uncertainties are from the\nmeasurement and the ncertainties in correcting the proper motion reference\nframe, respectively.

The VCS relates the statistics of fluctuations along the velocity\ncoordinate to the statistics of turbulence, thus it does not require spatial\ncoverage by sampling directions in the plane of the sky. We consider lines with\ndifferent degree of absorption and show that for lines of optical depth less\nthan one, our earlier treatment of the VCS developed for spectral emission\nlines is applicable, if the optical depth is used instead of intensity. This\namounts to correlating the logarithms of absorbed intensities. For larger\noptical depths and saturated absorption lines, we show, that the amount of\ninformation that one can use is, inevitably, limited by noise. In practical\nterms, this means that only wings of the line are available for the analysis.\nIn terms of the VCS formalism, this results in introducing an additional\nwindow, which size decreases with the increase of the optical depth. As a\nresult, strongly saturated absorption lines carry the information only about\nthe small scale turbulence. Nevertheless, the contrast of the fluctuations\ncorresponding to the small scale turbulence increases with the increase of the\noptical depth, which provides advantages for studying turbulence combining\nlines with different optical depths.

The long-known\n6.0 and 6.85 um bands are detected toward all sources, with the Class 0-type\nYSOs showing the deepest bands ever observed. In almost all sources the 6.0 um\nband is deeper than expected from the bending mode of pure solid H2O. The depth\nand shape variations of the remaining 5-7 um absorption indicate that it\nconsists of 5 independent components, which, by comparison to laboratory\nstudies, must be from at least 8 different carriers. Simple species are\nresponsible for much of the absorption in the 5-7 um region, at abundances of\n1-30% for CH3OH, 3-8% for NH3, 1-5% for HCOOH, ~6% for H2CO, and ~0.3% for\nHCOO- with respect to solid H2O. The 6.85 um band likely consists of one or two\ncarriers, of which one is less volatile than H2O because its abundance relative\nto H2O is enhanced at lower H2O/tau_9.7 ratios. It does not survive in the\ndiffuse interstellar medium (ISM), however. The similarity of the 6.85 um bands\nfor YSOs and background stars indicates that its carrier(s) must be formed\nearly in the molecular cloud evolution. If an NH4+ salt is the carrier its\nabundance with respect to solid H2O is typically 7%, and low temperature\nacid-base chemistry or cosmic ray induced reactions must have been involved in\nits formation. Possible origins are discussed for the carrier of an enigmatic,\nvery broad absorption between 5 and 8 um. Finally, all the phenomena observed\nfor ices toward massive YSOs are also observed toward low mass YSOs, indicating\nthat processing of the ices by internal ultraviolet radiation fields is a minor\nfactor in the early chemical evolution of the ices.

Like Cu, the periodic, linear chains of\nMn, Co and Ni correspond to a local shallow minimum. However, for most of the\ninfinite periodic chains, neither linear nor dimerized linear structures are\nfavored; to lower their energy the chains undergo a structural transformation\nto form planar zigzag and dimerized zigzag geometry. Dimerization in both\ninfinite and finite chains are much stronger than the usual Peierls distortion\nand appear to depend on the number of 3d-electrons. As a result of\ndimerization, a significant energy lowering occurs which, in turn, influences\nthe stability and physical properties. Metallic linear chain of Vanadium\nbecomes half-metallic upon dimerization. Infinite linear chain of Scandium also\nbecomes half-metallic upon transformation to zigzag structure. An interplay\nbetween the magnetic ground state and atomic as well as electronic structure of\nthe chain has been revealed. The end effects influence the geometry, energetics\nand magnetic ground state of the finite chains.

Methods: We compute the equivalent width of a\nrest-frame mid-ultraviolet, photospheric absorption-line index, the 1978 index\nfound to vary monotonically with stellar metallicity by Rix and collaborators.\nWe normalise and combine 75 SFG spectra from the GMASS survey to produce a\nspectrum corresponding to a total integration time 1652.5 hours (and a\nsignal-to-noise ratio ~100 for our 1.5 angstrom binning) of FORS2 spectroscopic\nobservations at the Very Large Telescope. Results: We measure an\niron-abundance, stellar metallicity of log (Z/Zsolar) = -0.574+/-0.159 for our\nspectrum representative of a galaxy of stellar mass 9.4 x 10^9 Msolar assuming\na Chabrier IMF. We find that the R04 model SFG spectrum for log (Z/Zsolar) =\n-0.699 solar metallicity provides the best description of our GMASS coadded\nspectrum. For similar galaxy stellar mass, our stellar metallicity is ~0.25 dex\nlower than the oxygen-abundance, gas-phase metallicity quantified by Erb and\ncollaborators for UV-selected star-forming galaxies at z=2. Conclusions: We\nconclude that we are witnessing the establishment of a light-element\noverabundance in galaxies as they are being formed at redshift z~2. Our\nmeasurements are reminiscent of the alpha-element enhancement seen in\nlow-redshift, galactic bulges and early-type galaxies.

In this paper, we\nreport the latest measurements where this framework has been operated on five\ndifferent sites over a global north-south link extending more than 10,000 km,\nprocessing a ``real-time'' data flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2008 15:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-11"}

Here, we propose a more general form of\nstratification, based on inducing levels in proof nets by means of indexes,\nwhich allows us to extend Girard's systems while keeping the same complexity\nproperties. In particular, it turns out that Girard's systems can be recovered\nby forcing depth and level to coincide. A consequence of the higher flexibility\nof levels with respect to depth is the absence of boxes for handling the\nparagraph modality. We use this fact to propose a variant of our polytime\nsystem in which the paragraph modality is only allowed on atoms, and which may\nthus serve as a basis for developing lambda-calculus type assignment systems\nwith more efficient typing algorithms than existing ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2008 15:08:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 19:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2009 13:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-17"}

We attempt to constraint the GC scenario as the cause of Uranus'\nobliquity as well as on the mechanisms able to give origin to the Uranian\nirregulars. Different capture mechanisms for irregulars operate at different\nstages on the giant planets formation process. The mechanisms able to capture\nthe uranian irregulars before and after the GC are analysed. Assuming that they\nwere captured before the GC, we calculate the orbital transfer of the nine\nirregulars by the impulse imparted by the GC. If their orbital transfer results\ndynamically implausible, they should have originated after the GC. We\ninvestigate and discuss the dissipative mechanisms able to operate later. In\nparticular Prospero could not exist at the time of the GC. Different capture\nmechanisms for Prospero after the GC are investigated. Gas drag by\nUranus'envelope and pull-down capture are not plausible mechanisms. Capture of\nProspero through a collisionless interaction seems to be difficult. The GC\nitself provides a mechanism of permanent capture. However, the capture of\nProspero by the GC is a low probable event. Catastrophic collisions could be a\npossible mechanism for the birth of Prospero and the other irregulars after the\nGC. Orbital and physical clusterings should then be expected. Either Prospero\nhad to originate after the GC or the GC did not occur. In the former case, the\nmechanism for the origin of Prospero after the GC remains an open question. In\nthe latter case, another theory to account for Uranus' obliquity and the\nformation of the Uranian regular satellites on the equatorial plane of the\nplanet would be needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2008 15:46:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2008 11:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-10"}
