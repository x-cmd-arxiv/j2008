These are defined as subhalos that have at\nsome time in the past been within the virial radius of the halo's main\nprogenitor and that have survived as self-bound entities to $z=0$. We find that\nthis population extends beyond {\\it three times} the virial radius, and\ncontains objects on extreme orbits. We trace the origin of these unorthodox\norbits to the tidal dissociation of bound groups of subhalos, which results in\nthe ejection of some subhalos along tidal streams. Ejected subhalos are\nprimarily low-mass systems, leading to mass-dependent biases in their spatial\ndistribution and kinematics: the lower the subhalo mass at accretion time, the\nless centrally concentrated and kinematically hotter their descendant\npopulation. The bias is strongest amongst the most massive subhalos, but\ndisappears at the low-mass end. Our findings imply that subhalos identified\nwithin the virial radius represent an incomplete census of the substructure\nphysically related to a halo: only about {\\it one half} of all associated\nsubhalos are found today within the virial radius of a halo.

A central issue is the origin of\nthe differences in the physical properties of these copper oxides doped to\nopposite sides of the superconducting region. In the overdoped regime, the\nmaterial behaves as a reasonably conventional metal, with a large Fermi\nsurface. The underdoped regime, however, is highly anomalous and appears to\nhave no coherent Fermi surface, but only disconnected \"Fermi arcs\". The\nfundamental question, then, is whether underdoped copper oxides have a Fermi\nsurface, and if so, whether it is topologically different from that seen in the\noverdoped regime. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations in the\nelectrical resistance of the oxygen-ordered copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6.5,\nestablishing the existence of a well-defined Fermi surface in the ground state\nof underdoped copper oxides, once superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic\nfield. The low oscillation frequency reveals a Fermi surface made of small\npockets, in contrast to the large cylinder characteristic of the overdoped\nregime.

Fuzzy spaces are approximations to the algebra of functions of a\ncontinuous space by a finite matrix algebra. In the limit of infinitely large\nmatrices the formulation is exact. An attractive feature of this approach is\nthat it transparently shows how the geometrical properties of the continuous\nspace are preserved. In the study of the non-perturbative regime of QFT, fuzzy\nspaces provide a possible alternative to the lattice as a regularisation\nmethod. The thesis is divided into two parts.

The ubiquity of\nthese growth patterns suggests that they are driven by a universal mechanism\ncommon to all microbial species. In previous work, we showed that a minimal\nmodel accounting only for enzyme induction and dilution explains the phenotypes\nobserved in batch cultures of various wild-type and mutant/recombinant cells.\nHere, we examine the extension of the minimal model to continuous cultures. We\nshow that: (1) Several enzymatic trends, usually attributed to specific\nregulatory mechanisms such as catabolite repression, are completely accounted\nfor by dilution. (2) The bifurcation diagram of the minimal model for\ncontinuous cultures, which classifies the substrate consumption pattern at any\ngiven dilution rate and feed concentrations, provides a a precise explanation\nfor the empirically observed correlation between the growth patterns in batch\nand continuous cultures.

The model captures the variation of the\nsteady state substrate concentrations, cell densities, and enzyme levels during\nthe single- and mixed-substrate growth of bacteria and yeasts at various\ndilution rates and feed concentrations. (4) This variation is well-approximated\nby simple analytical expressions that furnish physical insights into the steady\nstates of continuous cultures.

When the two CoFeB\nlayers of a strongly antiferromagnetically coupled SyF free layer had the same\nthickness, Jc0 was reduced to 2-4x10^6 A/cm^2. This low Jc0 may be due to the\ndecreased effective volume under the large spin accumulation at the CoFeB/Ru.\nThe E/kBT was over 60, resulting in a retention time of over ten years and\nsuppression of the write current dispersion for SPRAM. The use of the SyF free\nlayer also resulted in a bistable (parallel/antiparallel) magnetization\nconfiguration at zero field, enabling the realization of CIMS without the need\nto apply external fields to compensate for the offset field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2008 04:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\npreviously developed thermodynamics of surface-stimulated crystal nucleation\nrigorously showed that if at least one of the facets of the crystal is only\npartially wettable by its melt, then it is thermodynamically more favorable for\nthe nucleus to form with that facet at the droplet surface rather than within\nthe droplet. So far, however, the kinetic aspects of this phenomenon had not\nbeen studied at all. The theory proposed in the present paper advocates that\neven in the surface-stimulated mode crystal nuclei initially emerge (as\nsub-critical clusters) homogeneously in the sub-surface layer, not\n\"pseudo-heterogeneously\" at the surface. A homogeneously emerged sub-critical\ncrystal can become a surface-stimulated nucleus due to density and structure\nfluctuations. This effect contributes to the total rate of crystal nucleation\n(as the volume-based mode does). An explicit expression for the total\nper-particle rate of crystal nucleation is derived. Numerical evaluations for\nwater droplets suggest that the surface-stimulated mode can significantly\nenhance the per-particle rate of crystal nucleation in droplets as large as 10\nmicrons in radius.

A mathematical analysis shows, that these spiral graphs are\ncaused exclusively by quadratic polynomials. For example the well known Euler\nPolynomial x2+x+41 appears on the Square Root Spiral in the form of three\nspiral-graphs, which are defined by three different quadratic polynomials. All\nnatural numbers,divisible by a certain prime factor, also lie on defined spiral\ngraphs on the Square Root Spiral (or Spiral of Theodorus, or Wurzelspirale).\nAnd the Square Numbers 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 even form a highly three-symmetrical\nsystem of three spiral graphs, which divides the square root spiral into three\nequal areas. Fibonacci number sequences also play a part in the structure of\nthe Square Root Spiral.

This\nlatter is modeled as a collection of magnetized scattering centers such as\nradio cocoons, magnetized galactic winds, clusters or magnetized filaments of\nlarge scale structure, with negligible magnetic fields in between. Magnetic\ndeflection is no longer a continuous process, it is rather dominated by\nscattering events. We study the interaction between high energy cosmic rays and\nthe scattering agents. We then compute the optical depth of the Universe to\ncosmic ray scattering and discuss the phenomological consequences for various\nsource scenarios. For typical parameters of the scattering centers, the optical\ndepth is greater than unity at 5x10^{19}eV, but the total angular deflection is\nsmaller than unity. One important consequence of this scenario is the\npossibility that the last scattering center encountered by a cosmic ray be\nmistaken with the source of this cosmic ray. In particular, we suggest that\npart of the correlation recently reported by the Pierre Auger Observatory may\nbe affected by such delusion: this experiment may be observing in part the last\nscattering surface of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays rather than their source\npopulation.
