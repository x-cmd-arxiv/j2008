This model explains\nvery recent experimental results, such as the unusual lobe-type structure in\nthe visibility of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations, phase rigidity, and the asymmetry\nof the visibility as a function of transparencies of quantum point contacts.\nAccording to our model, dephasing in the interferometer originates from strong\nCoulomb interaction at the edge of two-dimensional electron gas. The long-range\ncharacter of the interaction leads to a separation of the spectrum of edge\nexcitations on slow and fast mode. These modes are excited by electron\ntunneling and carry away the phase information. The new energy scale associated\nwith the slow mode determines the temperature dependence of the visibility and\nthe period of its oscillations as a function of voltage bias.

We run Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for turbulent channel flow\nat shear Reynolds numbers equal to 150 and 300 and corresponding a-priori and\na-posteriori LES on differently coarse grids.

We also focused on how particle preferential\nsegregation is predicted by LES. Results show that even ``well-resolved'' LES\nis unable to reproduce the physics as demonstrated by DNS, both for particle\naccumulation at the wall and for particle preferential segregation.

The detection of photometric or\nspectral variability would provide insight into unresolved atmospheric\nheterogeneities, such as holes in a global cloud deck.\n  Aims: It has been proposed that growth of heterogeneities in the global cloud\ndeck may account for the L- to T-type transition as brown dwarf photospheres\nevolve from cloudy to clear conditions. Such a mechanism is compatible with\nvariability. We searched for variability in the spectra of five L6 to T6 brown\ndwarfs in order to test this hypothesis.\n  Methods: We obtained spectroscopic time series using VLT/ISAAC, over\n0.99-1.13um, and IRTF/SpeX for two of our targets, in J, H and K bands.

The expertise nowadays required to design good string\ndata structures and algorithms is therefore transversal to many computer\nscience fields and much more study on the orchestration of known, or novel,\ntechniques is needed to make progress in this fascinating topic. This survey is\naimed at illustrating the key ideas which should constitute, in our opinion,\nthe current background of every index designer. We also discuss the positive\nfeatures and drawback of known indexing schemes and algorithms, and devote much\nattention to detail research issues and open problems both on the theoretical\nand the experimental side.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2008 20:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-16"}

The shape of the lightcurve can be compared to that of V1493 Aql, but\nthe whole event in that case was not as bright and only lasted a couple of\nweeks.

Methods: We used the medium resolution spectroscopy obtained in\nten nights over a period of 79 nights to investigate the change of the velocity\nstructure of the ejecta.

For this purpose, we start with a binary low-density\ngenerator-matrix (LDGM) code, and construct the quantization codebook by\nperiodically repeating its set of binary codewords, or them mapped to m-ary\nones with Gray mapping. The quantization algorithm is based on belief\npropagation, and it uses a decimation procedure to do the guessing necessary\nfor convergence.

A variety of\nquasigroups(loops) that are not universal have been found to be isotopic\ninvariant relative to a special type of isotopism or the other. Presently,\nthere are two outstanding open problems on universality of loops: semi\nautomorphic inverse property loops(1999) and Osborn loops(2005). Smarandache\nisotopism(S-isotopism) was originally introduced by Vasantha Kandasamy in 2002.\nBut in this work, the concept is re-restructured in order to make it more\nexplorable. As a result of this, the theory of Smarandache isotopy inherits the\nopen problems as highlighted above for isotopy. In this short note, the\nquestion 'Under what type of S-isotopism will a pair of S-quasigroups(S-loops)\nform any variety?' is answered by presenting a pair of specially S-isotopic\nS-quasigroups(loops) that both belong to the same variety of\nS-quasigroups(S-loops). This is important because pairs of specially S-isotopic\nS-quasigroups(e.g Smarandache cross inverse property quasigroups) that are of\nthe same variety are useful for applications(e.g cryptography).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2008 15:21:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2008 09:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-05"}

A key\ntheme is to emphasize the inherent limits that self-shadowing places on\nline-driven mass loss rates, whereas continuum driving can in principle drive\nmass up to the \"photon-tiring\" limit, for which the energy to lift the wind\nbecomes equal to the stellar luminosity.
