Since extinction is a property of column density along the line\nof sight, the presence of a protoplanetary disk may lead to a misclassification\nwhen the system is viewed edge-on.\n  We performed radiative transfer calculations, using the axysimmetric 3D\nradiative transfer codes RADMC and RADICAL, to show the effects of different\ngeometries on the main indicators of YSO evolutionary stage, like the slope of\nthe flux between 2 and 24mum, the bolometric temperature and the optical depth\nof silicates and ices.\n  We show that for systems viewed at intermediate angles the 'classical'\nindicators of evolution accurately trace the envelope column density, and they\nall agree with each other.

This class of graphs includes the Cayley\ngraphs of amalgamated products, HNN extensions or general groups acting on\ntrees. It also includes all transitive graphs with more than one end. The idea\nof the method is to find a multi-type Galton--Watson branching process (with a\nparameter $p$) which has finite expected population size if and only if the\nexpected percolation cluster size is finite. This provides sufficient\ninformation about $p_c$. In particular, if the pairwise intersections of pieces\nare finite, then $p_c$ is the smallest positive $p$ such that $\\operatorname\n{det}(M-1)=0$, where $M$ is the first-moment matrix of the branching process.\nIf the pieces of the tree-like structure are finite, then $p_c$ is an algebraic\nnumber and we give an algorithm computing $p_c$ as a root of some algebraic\nfunction.

We determine the deflection of\nhydrogen atoms from their original trajectory in the unperturbed LISM and show\nthat it occurs not only in the plane defined by the ISMF and LISM velocity\nvectors, but also, to a lesser extent, perpendicular to this plane. We also\nconsider the possibility of using 2-3 kHz radio emission data to further\nconstrain the ISMF direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2008 00:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

When Ohm's law is combined with\nGauss' law and the equation of continuity, a differential equation for volume\ncharge density relaxation results. The usual solution to this equation shows\nthat charge decays exponentially with a relaxation time given by the material's\npermittivity divided by its electrical conductivity.

None of\nthe extreme scenarios can explain all observations. Pure laminar ambipolar\ndiffusion has relatively long growth times for typical ionization levels and\nhas difficulty satisfying core lifetime constraints. Purely hydrodynamic\npictures have trouble accounting for the inefficiency of core formation and the\ndetailed velocity structure of individual cores. A possible favorable scenario\nis a mixed model involving gravitational fragmentation of turbulent molecular\nclouds close to magnetic criticality. The evolution of the magnetic field and\nangular momentum in individual cloud cores after the onset of gravitational\ncollapse is also discussed.

Some tasks are more CPU-intensive than other\nand thus generate more heat during execution. The cooling system operates\nnon-stop, reducing (at an exponential rate) the deviation of the processor's\ntemperature from the ambient temperature. As a result, the processor's\ntemperature, and thus the performance as well, depends on the order of the task\nexecution. Given a variety of possible underlying architectures, models for\ncooling and for hardware thermal management, as well as types of tasks, this\nscenario gives rise to a plethora of interesting and never studied scheduling\nproblems.\n  We focus on scheduling real-time jobs in a simplified model for cooling and\nthermal management. A collection of unit-length jobs is given, each job\nspecified by its release time, deadline and heat contribution. If, at some time\nstep, the temperature of the system is t and the processor executes a job with\nheat contribution h, then the temperature at the next step is (t+h)/2. The\ntemperature cannot exceed the given thermal threshold T. The objective is to\nmaximize the throughput, that is, the number of tasks that meet their\ndeadlines. We prove that, in the offline case, computing the optimum schedule\nis NP-hard, even if all jobs are released at the same time. In the online case,\nwe show a 2-competitive deterministic algorithm and a matching lower bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2008 10:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-29"}

For strong lensing systems, it is often claimed that this degeneracy is\nbroken as soon as two or more sources at different redshifts are available.\nThis is definitely true in the strict sense that it is then impossible to add a\nconstant-density mass-sheet to the rescaled density of the lens without\naffecting the resulting images. However, often one can easily construct a more\ngeneral mass distribution -- instead of a constant-density sheet of mass --\nwhich gives rise to the same effect: a uniform scaling of the sources involved\nwithout affecting the observed images.

More\nspecifically, integrate-and-fire complex neuronal networks are activated at\neach of their nodes, and the dissemination of activation is monitored. As the\nactivation received by each neuron accumulates, its firing gets facilitated.\nThe time it takes for each neuron, other than the source, to receive the first\nnon-zero input (beginning activation time) and the time for it to produce the\nfirst spike (beginning spiking time) are identified through simulations. It is\nshown, with respect to two synthetic and a real-world (\\emph{C. elegans})\nneuronal complex networks, that the patterns of beginning activation times (and\nto a lesser extent also of the spiking times) tend to cluster into groups\ncorresponding to communities of neurons in the original complex neuronal\nnetwork. Such an effect is identified to be a direct consequence of the almost\nsimultaneous activation between the nodes inside the same community in which\nthe source of activation is placed, as well as of the respective trapping of\nactivation implied by the integration of activiation prior to firing.\nInterestingly, the accumulation of activity and thresholds inside each neuron\nwere found to be essential for constraining the initial activations within each\nrespective community during the transient activation (no clear clusters were\nobserved when using overall activation or spiking rates). In addition to its\nintrinsic value for neuroscience and structure-dynamics studies, these results\nconfirm the importance of the consideration of transient dynamics in complex\nsystems investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2008 13:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-29"}

The Psi' to J/Psi ratio is found to be crucial in disentangling the\ndifferent charmonium absorption scenarios especially in the RHIC energy range.\nFurthermore, a comparison of the transport calculations to the statistical\nmodel of Gorenstein and Gazdzicki as well as the statistical hadronization\nmodel of Andronic et al. shows differences in the energy dependence as well as\ncentrality dependence of the J/Psi to pion ratio which may be exploited\nexperimentally to disentangle different concepts. We find additionally that the\ncollective flow of charm in the HSD transport appears compatible with the data\nat SPS energies but substantially underestimates the data at top RHIC energies\nsuch that the large elliptic flow v_2 of charm seen experimentally has to be\nattributed to early interactions of non-hadronic degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2008 14:45:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2008 17:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The spectra were obtained at both\norbital conjunction phases in two separate runs in 2002 and 2003 when the\nsystem was in the X-ray high/soft state. The stellar wind lines suffer large\nreductions in strength when the black hole is in the foreground due to the\nX-ray ionization of the wind ions. A comparison of HST and archival IUE spectra\nshows that similar photoionization effects occur in both the X-ray states. We\nconstructed model UV wind line profiles assuming that X-ray ionization occurs\neverywhere in the wind except the zone where the supergiant blocks the X-ray\nflux. The good match between the observed and model profiles indicates that the\nwind ionization extends to near to the hemisphere of the supergiant facing the\nX-ray source. The H-alpha emission strength is generally lower in the high/soft\nstate compared to the low/hard state, but the He II 4686 emission is relatively\nconstant between states. The results suggest that mass transfer in Cyg X-1 is\ndominated by a focused wind flow that peaks along the axis joining the stars\nand that the stellar wind contribution is shut down by X-ray photoionization\neffects. The strong stellar wind from the shadowed side of the supergiant will\nstall when Coriolis deflection brings the gas into the region of X-ray\nillumination.

Agents are equipped with a budget, $x(t)$, and at each\ntime step invest a particular fraction, $q(t)$, of their budget. The return on\ninvestment (RoI), $r(t)$, is characterized by a periodic function with\ndifferent types and levels of noise. Risk-avoiding agents choose their fraction\n$q(t)$ proportional to the expected positive RoI, while risk-seeking agents\nalways choose a maximum value $q_{max}$ if they predict the RoI to be positive\n(\"everything on red\"). In addition to these different strategies, agents have\ndifferent capabilities to predict the future $r(t)$, dependent on their\ninternal complexity. Here, we compare 'zero-intelligent' agents using technical\nanalysis (such as moving least squares) with agents using reinforcement\nlearning or genetic algorithms to predict $r(t)$. The performance of agents is\nmeasured by their average budget growth after a certain number of time steps.\nWe present results of extensive computer simulations, which show that, for our\ngiven artificial environment, (i) the risk-seeking strategy outperforms the\nrisk-avoiding one, and (ii) the genetic algorithm was able to find this optimal\nstrategy itself, and thus outperforms other prediction approaches considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2008 15:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Sep 2008 13:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
