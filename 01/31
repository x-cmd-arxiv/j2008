Our multiple criteria, including the log N - log P distributions\nfrom the flux-limited GRB sample, the redshift and luminosity distributions of\nthe redshift-known sample, and the detection ratio of HL- and LL- GRBs with\nSwift/BAT, provide a set of stringent constraints to the luminosity function.\nAssuming that the GRB rate follows the star formation rate, our simulations\nshow that a simple power law or a broken power law model of luminosity function\nfail to reproduce the observations, and a new component is required.

Assuming Keplerian rotation in an edge-on disk, we obtain an enclosed\nmass of $(3.1\\pm 0.2) \\times 10^7 M_{\\sun}$ within $0.36\\pm 0.02$ pc ($1.48\\pm\n0.06$ mas), which corresponds to a mean mass density of $\\sim10^{8.2} M_{\\sun}$\npc$^{-3}$. We also report the measurement with the Green Bank Telescope of a\nvelocity drift, a manifestation of centripetal acceleration within the disk, of\n$5\\pm 1$ km s $^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ in the $\\sim3880$ km s$^{-1}$ maser feature,\nwhich is most likely located along the line of sight to the dynamical center of\nthe system. From the acceleration of this feature, we estimate a disk radius of\n$0.17\\pm 0.02$ pc, which is smaller than the inner disk radius ($0.36\\pm 0.02$\npc) of emission that occurs along the midline (i.e., the line of nodes). The\nemission along the line of sight to the dynamical center evidently occurs much\ncloser to the center than the emission from the disk midline, contrary to the\nsituation in the archetypal maser systems NGC4258 and NGC1068. The outer radius\nof the disk as traced by the masers along the midline is about 1.5 pc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2008 20:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Combining the Halpha-channel phases with\ninformation about the line strength, we recovered complex visibilities and\nimaged the Halpha emission using standard radio interferometry methods. We find\nthat the results from our differential phase technique are consistent with\nthose obtained from a more-standard analysis using squared visibilities\n(V^2's). Our images show the position of the Halpha emitting regions relative\nto the continuum photocenter as a function of orbital phase and indicate that\nthe major axis of the orbit is oriented along p.a.=248.8+/-1.7 deg. The orbit\nis smaller than previously predicted, a discrepancy that can be alleviated if\nwe assume that the system is at a larger distance from us, or that the\ncontribution of the stellar continuum to the Halpha channel is larger than\nestimated. Finally, we also detected a differential phase signal in the\nchannels containing HeI emission lines at 587.6 and 706.5nm, with orbital\nbehavior different from that of the Halpha, indicating that it originates from\na different part of this interacting system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2008 21:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

In this Letter, we provide new results that confirm the lack of close\nEHB binaries in globular clusters, and present a first scenario to explain the\ndifference between field and cluster EHB stars. First, in order to confirm that\nthe lack of EHB binaries in globular clusters is a statistically robust result,\nwe undertook a new analysis of 145 horizontal branch stars in NGC6752, out of\nwhich forty-one belong to the EHB. To search for radial-velocity variations as\na function of time, we repeated high-resolution (R=18500) spectroscopy of all\nstars, four times during a single night of observations. We detected a single,\nhot (25000 K), radial-velocity variable star as a close-binary candidate. From\nthese results, we estimate an upper-limit for the close (period P < 5 day)\nbinary fraction f among NGC6752 EHB stars of 16% (95% confidence level), with\nthe most probable value being f=4%. Thus our results clearly confirm the lack\nof close binaries among the hot HB stars in this cluster. We suggest that the\nconfirmed discrepancy between the binary fractions for field and cluster EHB\nstars is the consequence of an f-age relation, with close binaries being more\nlikely in the case of younger systems. We analyze theoretical and observational\nresults available in the literature, which support this scenario. If so, an age\ndifference between the EHB progenitors in the field and in clusters, the former\nbeing younger (on average) by up to several Gyr, would naturally account for\nthe startling differences in binary fraction between the two populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2008 23:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Mutators that increase\nthe mutation rate by the order of 100 fold have been observed to spontaneously\nemerge and achieve high frequencies in natural populations and in long-term\nlaboratory evolution experiments with \\textit{E. coli}. In principle, the\nfixation of mutator alleles is limited by (i) competition with mutations in\nwild-type backgrounds, (ii) additional deleterious mutational load, and (iii)\nrandom genetic drift. Using a multiple locus model and employing both\nsimulation and analytic methods, we investigate the effects of these three\nfactors on the fixation probability $P_{fix}$ of an initially rare mutator as a\nfunction of population size $N$, beneficial and deleterious mutation rates, and\nthe strength of mutations $s$.

We consider the\neffect of the quasi-2D nature of the experimental FQH system on a number of FQH\nstates (fillings 1/3, 1/5, 1/2) in the lowest, second, and third Landau levels\n(LLL, SLL, TLL,) by calculating the overlap, as a function of quasi-2D layer\nthickness, between the exact ground state of a model Hamiltonian and the\nconsensus variational wavefunctions (Laughlin wavefunction for 1/3 and 1/5 and\nthe Moore-Read Pfaffian wavefunction for 1/2). Using large overlap as a\nstability, or FQHE robustness, criterion we find the FQHE does not occur in the\nTLL (for any thickness), is the most robust for zero thickness in the LLL for\n1/3 and 1/5 and for 11/5 in the SLL, and is most robust at finite-thickness\n(4-5 magnetic lengths) in the SLL for the mysterious 5/2 state and the 7/3\nstate. No FQHE is found at 1/2 in the LLL for any thickness. We examine the\norbital effects of an in-plane (parallel) magnetic field finding its\napplication effectively reduces the thickness and could destroy the FQHE at 5/2\nand 7/3, while enhancing it at 11/5 as well as for LLL FQHE states. The\nin-plane field effects could thus be qualitatively different in the LLL and the\nSLL by virtue of magneto-orbital coupling through the finite thickness effect.\nIn the torus geometry, we show the appearance of the threefold topological\ndegeneracy expected for the Pfaffian state which is enhanced by thickness\ncorroborating our findings from overlap calculations.

According to Kraichnan's 1962 prediction, the\nflow boundary layers above the cold and hot plates -in which most of the fluid\ntemperature drop is localized- become unstable for large enough $Ra$ and this\ninstability boosts the heat transport compared to the other turbulent regimes.\nUsing the same convection cell as in the 1997 experiment, we show that the\nreported heat transport increase is accompanied with enhanced temperature\nfluctuations of the bottom plate, which was heated at constant power levels.\nIndeed, for $Ra < 10^{12}$, the bottom plate fluctuations can simply be\naccounted from those in the bulk of the flow. In particular, they share the\nsame spectral density at low frequencies, as if the bottom plate was following\nthe slow temperature fluctuations of the bulk, modulo a constant temperature\ndrop across the bottom boundary layer. Conversely, to account for the plate's\ntemperature fluctuations at higher $Ra$, we no-longuer can ignore the\nfluctuations of the temperature drop across the boundary layer. The negative\nskewness of fluctuations at high $Ra$ supports the picture of a boundary layer\ninstability. These observations provide new evidence that the transition\nreported in 1997 corresponds to the triggering of the Ultimate Regime of\nconvection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2008 07:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-07"}

The\nHI disk is sharply truncated to the southwest, well within the stellar disk. A\nregion of low surface-density gas, which is more extended than the main HI\ndisk, is discovered northeast of the galaxy center. These data are compared to\nexisting 6cm polarized radio continuum emission, Halpha, and optical broad band\nimages. We observe a coincidence between the western HI and polarized emission\nedges, on the one hand, and a faint Halpha emission ridge, on the other. The\npolarized emission maxima are located within the gaps between the spiral arms\nand the faint Halpha ridge. Based on the comparison of these observations with\na sample of dynamical simulations with different values for maximum ram\npressure and different inclination angles between the disk and the orbital\nplane,we conclude that ram pressure stripping can account for the main observed\ncharacteristics. NGC 4501 is stripped nearly edge-on, is heading southwest, and\nis ~200-300 Myr before peak ram pressure, i.e. its closest approach to M87. The\nsouthwestern ridge of enhanced gas surface density and enhanced polarized\nradio-continuum emission is due to ram pressure compression. It is argued that\nthe faint western Halpha emission ridge is induced by nearly edge-on ram\npressure stripping. NGC 4501 represents an especially clear example of early\nstage ram pressure stripping of a large cluster-spiral galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2008 14:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
