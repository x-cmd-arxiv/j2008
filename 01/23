The\nmodel is specified by a phase space distribution function which, in turn,\ndepends on the integrals of motion. Bayesian statistics and the Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo method are used to tailor the model to satisfy observational data\nand theoretical constraints. By way of example, we construct a chain of 10^5\nmodels for the Milky Way designed to fit a wide range of photometric and\nkinematic observations. From this chain, we calculate the probability\ndistribution function of important Galactic parameters such as the Sersic index\nof the bulge, the disk scale length, and the disk, bulge, and halo masses. We\nalso calculate the probability distribution function of the local dark matter\nvelocity dispersion and density, two quantities of paramount significance for\nterrestrial dark matter detection experiments.\n  Though the Milky Way models in our chain all satisfy the prescribed\nobservational constraints, they vary considerably in key structural parameters\nand therefore respond differently to non-axisymmetric perturbations.

The bar pattern speeds are ~ 40 - 50\nkm/s/kpc at the time when they form and then decrease, presumably due to\ncoupling of the bar with the halo. Since the Galactic bar has a pattern speed\n~50 km/s/kpc we conclude that it must have formed recently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2008 20:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-21"}

When the feedback is\ninstantaneous, solutions approach a self-limiting equilibrium state. When there\nis a delay, even though the feedback is negative, the solutions can exhibit\ncyclic and episodic solutions. We find that periodic or episodic star formation\nonly occurs when two conditions are satisfied. Firstly the delay timescale must\nexceed a cloud consumption timescale. Secondly the feedback must be strong.\nThis statement is quantitatively equivalent to requiring that the timescale to\napproach equilibrium be greater than approximately twice the cloud consumption\ntimescale. The period of oscillations predicted is approximately 4 times the\ndelay timescale. The amplitude of the oscillations increases with both feedback\nstrength and delay time.\n  We discuss applications of the delay differential equation (DDE) model to\nstar formation in galaxies using the cloud density as a variable. The DDE model\nis most applicable to systems that recycle gas and only slowly remove gas from\nthe system. We propose likely delay mechanisms based on the requirement that\nthe delay time is related to the observationally estimated time between\nepisodic events. The proposed delay timescale accounting for episodic star\nformation in galaxy centers on periods similar to P 10 Myrs, irregular galaxies\nwith P 100 Myrs, and the Milky Way disk with P~ 2Gyr, could be that for\nexciting turbulence following creation of massive stars, that for gas pushed\ninto the halo to return and interact with the disk and that for spiral density\nwave evolution, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2008 21:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

Our work builds on recent results that have established the\npossibility of significant capacity gains in the wideband/low-SNR regime when\nthere is perfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter.\nFurthermore, the perfect CSI benchmark gain can be obtained with the feedback\nof just one bit per channel coefficient. However, the input signals used in\nthese methods are peaky, that is, they have a large peak-to-average power\nratios. Signal peakiness is related to channel coherence and many recent\nmeasurement campaigns show that, in contrast to previous assumptions, wideband\nchannels exhibit a sparse multipath structure that naturally leads to coherence\nin time and frequency.

On the other hand, if $F$ is gauge invariant, $L^2$\ncharge is conserved and hence, as in the Euclidean case, it is possible to\nextend local $L^2$ solutions to global ones. The corresponding argument in\n$H^1$ requires the conservation of energy, which holds under the stronger\ncondition that $F$ is defocusing.

Assuming a hadronic\norigin, and distances of 2 and 4 kpc for cloud components, the required cosmic\nray density enhancement factors (with respect to the solar value) are in the\nrange ~10 to ~30. If situated at 2 kpc distance, such cosmic ray densities may\nbe supplied by a SNR like W28.

The potential is derived from an N-body calculation and leads to a\nmulti-armed time-evolving pattern. The gas forms long spiral arms typical of\ngrand design galaxies, although the spiral pattern is asymmetric. The primary\ndifference from a grand-design spiral galaxy, which has a consistent 2/4-armed\npattern, is that instead of passing through the spiral arms, gas generally\nfalls into a developing potential minimum and is released only when the local\nminimum dissolves. In this case, the densest gas is coincident with the spiral\npotential, rather than offset as in the grand-design spirals. We would there\nfore expect no offset between the spiral shock and star formation, and no\nobvious co-rotation radius. Spurs which occur in grand-design spirals when\nlarge clumps are sheared off leaving the spiral arms, are rare in the active,\ntime-evolving spiral reported here. Instead, large branches are formed from\nspiral arms when the underlying spiral potential is dissolving due to the\nN-body dynamics. We find that the molecular cloud mass spectrum for the active\npotential is similar to that for clouds in grand design calculations, depending\nprimarily on the ambient pressure rather than the nature of the potential.

After\ndiscussing the evolution of the background spacetime, focusing on the number of\ne-folds and the isotropization, we solve the perturbation equations and predict\nthe power spectra of the curvature perturbations and gravity waves at the end\nof inflation. The main features of the early anisotropic phase is (1) a\ndependence of the spectra on the direction of the modes, (2) a coupling between\ncurvature perturbations and gravity waves, and (3) the fact that the two\ngravity waves polarisations do not share the same spectrum on large scales. All\nthese effects are significant only on large scales and die out on small scales\nwhere isotropy is recovered. They depend on a characteristic scale that can,\nbut a priori must not, be tuned to some observable scale. To fix the initial\nconditions, we propose a procedure that generalises the one standardly used in\ninflation but that takes into account the fact that the WKB regime is violated\nat early times when the shear dominates. We stress that there exist modes that\ndo not satisfy the WKB condition during the shear-dominated regime and for\nwhich the amplitude at the end of inflation depends on unknown initial\nconditions. On such scales, inflation loses its predictability. This study\npaves the way to the determination of the cosmological signature of a\nprimordial shear, whatever the Bianchi I spacetime. It thus stresses the\nimportance of the WKB regime to draw inflationary predictions and demonstrates\nthat when the number of e-folds is large enough, the predictions converge\ntoward those of inflation in a Friedmann-Lemaitre spacetime but that they are\nless robust in the case of an inflationary era with a small number of e-folds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2008 15:10:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 May 2008 09:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Accurate (~ 10%)\ndistances, I band photometry, and B-V colors are known for the majority of the\ngalaxies in our sample. The faint galaxies are drawn from the Faint Irregular\nGalaxy GMRT survey (FIGGS), and we have HI rotation velocities derived from\naperture synthesis observations for all of them. For the faint galaxies, we\nfind that even though the median HI and stellar masses are comparable, the HI\nmass correlates significantly better with the circular velocity indicators than\nthe stellar mass. We also find that W$_{20}$ correlates better with mass than\nthe rotation velocity, although the difference is not statistically\nsignificant. The faint galaxies lie systematically below the I band TF relation\ndefined by bright galaxies, and also show significantly more intrinsic scatter.\nThis implies that the integrated star formation in these galaxies has been both\nless efficient and also less regulated than in large galaxies. We find that\nwhile the faint end deviation is greatly reduced in Baryonic Tully-Fisher (BTF)\nrelations, the existence of a break at the faint end of the BTF is subject to\nsystematics such as the assumed stellar mass to light ratio. If we assume that\nthere is an intrinsic BTF and try to determine the baryonic mass by searching\nfor prescriptions that lead to the tightest BTF, we find that scaling the HI\nmass leads to a much more significant tightening than scaling the stellar mass\nto light ratio. The most significant tightening that we find however, is if we\nscale the entire baryonic mass of the faint (but not the bright) galaxies.
