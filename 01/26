We review the progress made by numerical\nsimulations carried out on large parallel supercomputers. Recent progress stems\nfrom a combination of increased resolution and improved treatment of the\nastrophysical processes modeled in the simulations, such as the\nphenomenological description of the interstellar medium and of the process of\nstar formation. High mass and spatial resolution is a necessary condition in\norder to obtain large disks comparable with observed spiral galaxies avoiding\nspurious dissipation of angular momentum. A realistic model of the star\nformation history. gas-to-stars ratio and the morphology of the stellar and\ngaseous component is instead controlled by the phenomenological description of\nthe non-gravitational energy budget in the galaxy. We show that simulations of\ngas collapse within cold dark matter halos including a phenomenological\ndescription of supernovae blast-waves allow to obtain stellar disks with nearly\nexponential surface density profiles as those observed in real disk galaxies,\ncounteracting the tendency of gas collapsing in such halos to form cuspy\nbaryonic profiles. However, the ab-initio formation of a realistic rotationally\nsupported disk galaxy with a pure exponential disk in a fully cosmological\nsimulation is still an open problem. We argue that the suppression of bulge\nformation is related to the physics of galaxy formation during the merger of\nthe most massive protogalactic lumps at high redshift, where the reionization\nof the Universe likely plays a key role. A sufficiently high resolution during\nthis early phase of galaxy formation is also crucial to avoid artificial\nangular momentum loss (Abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2008 20:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-28"}

The purpose\nof this paper is to provide a simple theoretical description of the\ncontact-induced decoherence in ballistic nanostructures, which is established\nwithin the framework of the open systems theory. The active region's evolution\nin the presence of contacts is generally non-Markovian. However, if the\ncontacts' energy relaxation due to electron-electron scattering is sufficiently\nfast, then the contacts can be considered memoryless on timescales coarsened\nover their energy relaxation time, and the evolution of the current-limiting\nactive region can be considered Markovian. Therefore, we first derive a general\nMarkovian map in the presence of a memoryless environment, by coarse-graining\nthe exact short-time non-Markovian dynamics of an abstract open system over the\nenvironment memory-loss time, and we give the requirements for the validity of\nthis map. We then introduce a model contact-active region interaction that\ndescribes carrier injection from the contacts for a generic two-terminal\nballistic nanostructure. Starting from this model interaction and using the\nMarkovian dynamics derived by coarse-graining over the effective memory-loss\ntime of the contacts, we derive the formulas for the nonequilibrium\nsteady-state distribution functions of the forward and backward propagating\nstates in the nanostructure's active region.

Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols\nwith single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source\nuser, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merit that\nthe improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users.

It is well-known that the maximum possible throughput of a slotted\nAloha system with a large number of nodes is 1/e = 0.3679. Indeed, a saturation\nthroughput of 1/e can be achieved with an exponential backoff factor of r =\ne/(e-1)=1.5820. The binary backoff factor of r = 2 is assumed in the majority\nof prior work, and in many practical multiple-access networks such as the\nEthernet and WiFi. For slotted Aloha, the saturation throughput 0.3466 for r =\n2 is reasonably close to the maximum of 1/e, and one could hardly raise\nobjection to adopting r = 2 in the system. However, this paper shows that if\nmean queuing delay is to be bounded, then the sustainable throughput when r = 2\nis only 0.2158, a drastic 41% drop from 1/e . Fortunately, the optimal setting\nof r = 1.3757 under the bounded mean-delay requirement allows us to achieve\nsustainable throughput of 0.3545, a penalty of only less than 4% relative to\n1/e. A general conclusion is that the value of r may significantly affect the\nqueuing delay performance. Besides analyzing mean queuing delay, this paper\nalso delves into the phenomenon of starvation, wherein some nodes are deprived\nof service for an extended period of time while other nodes hog the system.\nSpecifically, we propose a quantitative definition for starvation and show that\nthe conditions to guarantee bounded mean delay and non-starved operation are\none of the same, thus uniting these two notions. Finally, we show that when\nmean delay is large and starvation occurs, the performance results obtained\nfrom simulation experiments may not converge.

Parameters of the kinetic model are biologically\nmeaningful, but the optimization of the non-linear model has significant\ncomputational issues. In practice, convergence of the optimization algorithm is\nnot guaranteed and the accuracy of the model fitting may be compromised. To\novercome this problems, this paper proposes a semi-parametric penalized spline\nsmoothing approach, with which the AIF is convolved with a set of B-splines to\nproduce a design matrix using locally adaptive smoothing parameters based on\nBayesian penalized spline models (P-splines). It has been shown that kinetic\nparameter estimation can be obtained from the resulting deconvolved response\nfunction, which also includes the onset of contrast enhancement. Detailed\nvalidation of the method, both with simulated and in vivo data, is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2008 08:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}
