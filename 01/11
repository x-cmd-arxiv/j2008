Aims: Cosmic ray transport within elliptical\ngalaxies is an interesting element in understanding the origin of high\nenergetic particles measured on Earth. As probable sources of those high\nenergetic particles, elliptical galaxies show a dense interstellar medium as a\nconsequence of activity in the galactic nucleus or merging events between\ngalaxies. Thus it is necessary for an appropriate description of cosmic ray\ntransport to take the diffusive and convective processes in a dense\ninterstellar environment into account. Here we show that the transport\nequations can be solved analytically with respect to the given geometry and\nboundary conditions in position space, as well as in momentum space. Results:\nThe spatial solution is shown using a generalized source of cosmic rays.\nAdditionally, the special case of a jet-like source is illustrated. We present\nthe solution in momentum space with respect to an escape term for cosmic ray\nprotons depending on the spatial shape of the galaxy. For a delta-shape\ninjection function, the momentum solution is obtained analytically. We find\nthat the spectral index measured on Earth can be obtained by appropriately\nchoosing of the strength of Fermi I and Fermi II processes. From these results\nwe calculate the gamma-ray flux from pion decay due to proton-proton\ninteraction to give connection to observations. Additionally we determine the\nescape-spectrum of cosmic rays.

The functional\nintegral formulation of this problem in d spatial dimensions yields a\n(d+1)-dimensional classical XY-model with extended disorder--the so-called\nrandom rod problem. Particle-hole symmetry may then be broken by adding nonzero\nsite energies. We may distinguish three cases: (i) exact particle-hole\nsymmetry, in which the site energies all vanish, (ii) statistical particle-hole\nsymmetry in which the site energy distribution is symmetric about zero,\nvanishing on average, and (iii) complete absence of particle-hole symmetry in\nwhich the distribution is generic. We explore in each case the nature of the\nexcitations in the non-superfluid Mott insulating and Bose glass phases. We\nfind that the Bose glass compressibility, which has the interpretation of a\ntemporal spin stiffness or superfluid density, is positive in cases (ii) and\n(iii), but that it vanishes with an essential singularity as full particle-hole\nsymmetry is restored.

Our sun must have rotated more rapidly in its past, as is\nsuggested by observations of many rapidly rotating young solar-type stars. Here\nwe explore the effects of more rapid rotation on the patterns of convection in\nsuch stars and the global-scale flows which are self-consistently established.\nThe convection in these systems is richly time dependent and in our most\nrapidly rotating suns a striking pattern of spatially localized convection\nemerges. Convection near the equator in these systems is dominated by one or\ntwo patches of locally enhanced convection, with nearly quiescent streaming\nflow in between at the highest rotation rates. These active nests of convection\nmaintain a strong differential rotation despite their small size. The structure\nof differential rotation is similar in all of our more rapidly rotating suns,\nwith fast equators and slower poles. We find that the total shear in\ndifferential rotation, as measured by latitudinal angular velocity contrast,\nDelta_Omega, increases with more rapid rotation while the relative shear,\nDelta_Omega/Omega, decreases. In contrast, at more rapid rotation the\nmeridional circulations decrease in both energy and peak velocities and break\ninto multiple cells of circulation in both radius and latitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2008 21:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25"}

This is demonstrated using a semianalytic\nsimulation of galaxy formation within the standard hierarchical scenario of\nstructure formation. The assumed threshold mass is motivated by the prediction\nof stable shock heating above this mass and the finding that such a shutdown\nreproduces the observed distribution of galaxies in luminosity and colour.The\nshutdown at a critical halo mass introduces a characteristic stellar mass for\nthe transition of galaxies into the `red sequence' of the galaxy\ncolour-magnitude diagram. Central galaxies of haloes that are more massive\ntoday have reached this mass earlier and can therefore grow further along the\nred sequence by dry mergers, ending up more massive and containing older stars.\nSmall galaxies formed in haloes below the critical mass can shutdown late, when\nthey fall into haloes above the critical mass and become satellites. While our\nsemianalytic simulation that incorporates an explicit shutdown reproduces\ndownsizing as inferred from the stellar ages of ellipticals, we explain why it\nis much harder to detect downsizing using the mass functions of different\ngalaxy types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2008 21:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Errors, in boundary conditions,\nappearing owing to linear interpolation may lead to increasing errors in\nnumerical solution during integration. The methods developed to reduce these\nerrors deal with continuous dynamic assimilation of known global data available\ninside the regional domain. Essentially, this assimilation procedure performs a\nnudging of large-scale component of regional model solution to large-scale\nglobal data component by introducing the relaxation forcing terms into the\nregional model equations.

Instead, for each pair of processes\nwhich interact, our method constructs an automata-theoretic product\n(\\intr{pair-machine}) which embodies all the possible interactions of these two\nprocesses. From each pair-machine, we can synthesize a correct\n\\intr{pair-program} which coordinates the two involved processes as needed. We\nallow such pair-programs to be added dynamically at run-time. They are then\n``composed conjunctively'' with the currently alive pair-programs to\nre-synthesize the program as it results after addition of the new pair-program.\nWe are thus able to add new behaviors, which result in new properties being\nsatisfied, at run-time. We establish a ``large model'' theorem which shows that\nthe synthesized large program inherits correctness properties from the\npair-programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2008 21:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-14"}

The large scatter in both the metallicity and\nradiation hardness dependence of this behavior implies that it is not due to a\nsingle effect, but to some combination.

Results: While the continuum emission in NGC6334I\nmainly traces the UCHII region, toward NGC6334I(N) we detect line emission from\nfour of the previously identified dust continuum condensations that are of\nprotostellar or pre-stellar nature. The CH3CN(5_K-4_K) lines are detected in\nall K-components up to energies of 128K above ground toward two protostellar\ncondensations in both regions. We find line-width increasing with increasing K\nfor all sources, which indicates a higher degree of internal motions closer to\nthe central protostars. Toward the main mm and CH3CN source in NGC6334I we\nidentify a velocity gradient approximately perpendicular to the large-scale\nmolecular outflow. This may be interpreted as a signature of an accretion disk,\nalthough other scenarios, e.g., an unresolved double source, could produce a\nsimilar signature as well. No comparable signature is found toward any of the\nother sources. HCN does not trace the dense gas well but it is dominated by the\nmolecular outflows. While the outflow in NGC6334I exhibits a normal Hubble-law\nlike velocity structure, the data indicate a precessing outflow close to the\nplane of the sky for NGC6334I(N).

The multiple images allow us\nto construct an accurate 2-dimensional mass map of the central part of the\ncluster. The modelling of the cluster mass includes the most prominent cluster\ngalaxies modelled as truncated isothermal spheres and a smooth halo component\nthat is described with 2 parametric profiles. The mass reconstruction is done\nusing a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that provides us with a total projected\nmass density as well as estimates for the parameters of interest and their\nrespective errors. The mass profile is in reasonable agreement with previous\nmass estimates based on the X-ray emission from the hot intra-cluster gas,\nhowever the X-ray mass estimates are systematically lower than what we obtain\nwith gravitational lensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2008 15:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
