Many X-ray binaries lie in the Galactic\nplane and as such are often heavily obscured in the optical by interstellar\nextinction. The infrared component of the SED, vital to the study of jets and\ndust, can be provided {\\it only} by Spitzer; in the X-rays we currently have an\nunprecedented six satellites available and in the optical and radio dozens of\nground-based facilities to complement the Spitzer observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2008 18:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

This paper derives exact\ncapacity formulas and presents a new randomized fingerprinting scheme with the\nfollowing properties: (1) the encoder and receiver assume a nominal coalition\nsize but do not need to know the actual coalition size and the collusion\nchannel; (2) a tunable parameter $\\Delta$ trades off false-positive and\nfalse-negative error exponents; (3) the receiver provides a reliability metric\nfor its decision; and (4) the scheme is capacity-achieving when the\nfalse-positive exponent $\\Delta$ tends to zero and the nominal coalition size\ncoincides with the actual coalition size.\n  A fundamental component of the new scheme is the use of a \"time-sharing\"\nrandomized sequence. The decoder is a maximum penalized mutual information\ndecoder, where the significance of each candidate coalition is assessed\nrelative to a threshold, and the penalty is proportional to the coalition size.\nA much simpler {\\em threshold decoder} that satisfies properties (1)---(3)\nabove but not (4) is also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2008 20:37:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2008 17:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 22:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-26"}

We explain various viewpoints on topological\n2-groups and Cech cohomology with coefficients in a topological 2-group C, also\nknown as 'nonabelian cohomology'. Then we give an elementary proof that under\nmild conditions on M and C there is a bijection between the first Cech\ncohomology of M with coefficients in C and [M,B|C|] where B|C| is the\nclassifying space of the geometric realization of the nerve of C. Applying this\nresult to the 'string 2-group' String(G) of a simply-connected compact simple\nLie group G, it follows that principal String(G)-2-bundles have rational\ncharacteristic classes coming from elements of the rational cohomology of BG\nmodulo the ideal generated by c, where c is any nonzero element in the 4th\ncohomology of BG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2008 20:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2009 14:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-27"}

Accretion discs are a fundamental component\nof several astrophysical systems on very diverse scales, and can be found\naround supermassive black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and also in\nour Galaxy around stellar mass compact objects and around young stars.\nNotwithstanding the specific differences arising from such diversity in\nphysical extent, all these systems share a common feature where a central\nobject is fed from the accretion disc, due to the effect of turbulence and disc\ninstabilities, which are able to remove the angular momentum from the gas and\nallow its accretion. In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that\nthe gravitational field produced by the disc itself (the disc's self-gravity)\nis an important ingredient in the models, especially in the context of\nprotostellar discs and of AGN discs. Indeed, it appears that in many cases (and\nespecially in the colder outer parts of the disc) the development of\ngravitational instabilities can be one of the main agents in the redistribution\nof angular momentum. In some cases, the instability can be strong enough to\nlead to the formation of gravitationally bound clumps within the disc, and thus\nto determine the disc fragmentation. As a result, progress in our understanding\nof the dynamics of self-gravitating discs is essential to understand the\nprocesses that lead to the feeding of both young stars and of supermassive\nblack holes in AGN. At the same time, understanding the fragmentation\nconditions is important to determine under which conditions AGN discs would\nfragment and form stars and whether protostellar discs might form giant gaseous\nplanets through disc fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2008 00:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Because the mid-infrared is created by dust reprocessing of shorter\nwavelength nuclear light, this ratio is a diagnostic of f_obsc, the fraction of\nsolid angle around the nucleus covered by obscuring matter.

We studied the dependence of these properties on the properties\nof the QSOs and also, compared the properties with those of a similarly\nselected sample of 809 intervening systems (apparent relative velocity with\nrespect to the QSO of >3000km/s), so as to understand their origin.

The ionization so measured appears to be related to apparent\nejection velocity, being lower as the apparent ejection velocity is more and\nmore positive.

The double lobes of the radio galaxy MSH\n05-22 are giant--1.8 Mpc projected linear size--and interacting with the\nenvironment outside the interstellar medium and coronal halo associated with\nthe host galaxy. The radio lobes appear to be relicts and the double structure\nis asymmetric. We have examined the large-scale structure in the galaxy\ndistribution surrounding the radio source. The host galaxy of MSH 05-22 is\nassociated with a small group that lies close to the boundary of sheet-like and\nfilamentary density enhancements, and adjacent to a void. Assuming that the\ngalaxies trace gas, the asymmetries in the radio morphology in this case study\nappear related to the anisotropy in the medium.

The discordance suggests that even sources like\nMSH 05-22, which are observed in the relatively low-density IGM environment\nassociated with the filamentary large-scale structure and have multiple\nsignatures of being relicts, may be overpressured and evolving towards an\nequilibrium relaxed state with the ambient IGM.

The code includes treatments of two-body relaxation,\nthree- and four-body interactions involving primordial binaries and those\nformed dynamically, the Galactic tide, and the internal evolution of both\nsingle and binary stars. We arrive at a set of initial parameters for the\ncluster which, after 12Gyr of evolution, gives a model with a satisfactory\nmatch to the surface brightness profile, the velocity dispersion profile, and\nthe luminosity function in two fields. We describe in particular the evolution\nof the core, and find that M4 (which has a classic King profile) is actually a\npost-collapse cluster, its core radius being sustained by binary burning. We\nalso consider the distribution of its binaries, including those which would be\nobserved as photometric binaries and as radial-velocity binaries. We also\nconsider the populations of white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes and blue\nstragglers, though not all channels for blue straggler formation are\nrepresented yet in our simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2008 15:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The radial profiles of the stellar radial velocities and the\nvelocity dispersion are measured. N-body simulations are used to construct\ndynamical models of galaxies containing a stellar disk, bulge, and halo. The\nmasses of individual components are estimated formaximum-mass disk models. A\ncomparison of models with estimated rotational velocities and the stellar\nvelocity dispersion suggests that the stellar disks in lenticular galaxies are\n\"overheated\"; i.e., there is a significant excess velocity dispersion over the\nminimum level required to maintain the stability of the disk. This supports the\nhypothesis that the stellar disks of S0 galaxies were subject to strong\ngravitational perturbations. The relative thickness of the stellar disks in the\nS0 galaxies considered substantially exceed the typical disk thickness of\nspiral galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2008 15:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
