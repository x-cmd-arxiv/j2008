Our\nobservations were made at 890 micron with the Submillimetre Array (SMA). Our\nhigh-resolution submm imaging detects LH850.02 at >6-sigma as a single compact\n(size < 1 arcsec or < 8 kpc) point source and yields its absolute position to\n~0.2-arcsec accuracy. LH850.02 has two alternative radio counterparts within\nthe SCUBA beam (LH850.02N & S), both of which are statistically very unlikely\nto be so close to the SCUBA source position by chance. However, the precise\nastrometry from the SMA shows that the submm emission arises entirely from\nLH850.02N, and is not associated with LH850.02S (by far the brighter of the two\nalternative identifications at 24-micron). Fits to the optical-infrared\nmulti-colour photometry of LH850.02N & S indicate that both lie at z~3.3, and\nare therefore likely to be physically associated. At these redshifts, the 24\nmicron--to--submm flux density ratios suggest that LH850.02N has an Arp220-type\nstarburst-dominated far-IR SED, while LH850.02S is more similar to Mrk231, with\nless dust-enshrouded star-formation activity, but a significant contribution at\n24-micron (rest-frame ~5-6 micron) from an active nucleus. This complex mix of\nstar-formation and AGN activity in multi-component sources may be common in the\nhigh redshift ultraluminous galaxy population, and highlights the need for\nprecise astrometry from high resolution interferometric imaging for a more\ncomplete understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2008 20:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2008 17:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In addition, we\nshow that the revenue-maximizing mechanism is not truthful, but has a Nash\nequilibrium whose outcome is identical to our mechanism. As far as we can tell,\nthis is the first treatment of sponsored search that directly incorporates both\nmultiple slots and budget constraints into an analysis of incentives.\n  Our mechanism employs a descending-price auction that maintains a solution to\na certain machine scheduling problem whose job lengths depend on the price, and\nhence is variable over the auction. The price stops when the set of bidders\nthat can afford that price pack exactly into a block of ad slots, at which\npoint the mechanism allocates that block and continues on the remaining slots.\nTo prove our result on the equilibrium of the revenue-maximizing mechanism, we\nfirst show that a greedy algorithm suffices to solve the revenue-maximizing\nlinear program; we then use this insight to prove that bidders allocated in the\nsame block of our mechanism have no incentive to deviate from bidding the fixed\nprice of that block.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2008 16:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-21"}

It was shown recently by Valiant, Cai, and\nChoudhary that tensor networks can be efficiently contracted on planar graphs\nif components of every tensor obey a system of quadratic equations known as\nmatchgate identities. Such tensors are referred to as matchgate tensors. The\npresent paper provides an alternative approach to contraction of matchgate\ntensor networks that easily extends to non-planar graphs. Specifically, it is\nshown that a matchgate tensor network on a graph $G$ of genus $g$ with $n$\nvertices can be contracted in time $T=poly(n) + 2^{2g} O(m^3)$ where $m$ is the\nminimum number of edges one has to remove from $G$ in order to make it planar.\nOur approach makes use of anticommuting (Grassmann) variables and Gaussian\nintegrals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2008 23:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-16"}

Like gene expression profiles,\narrayCGH profiles are characterized by a large number of variables usually\nmeasured on a limited number of samples. However, arrayCGH profiles have a\nparticular structure of correlations between variables, due to the spatial\norganization of BACs along the genome.
