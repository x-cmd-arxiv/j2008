We perform two-dimensional modeling of the light\ndistributions to analyze the host galaxies' morphology.

Our results are compatible with the\npresence of both GeSe4/2 tetrahedra and Se-Se bonds. The Ag atoms are linked to\nSe in a triangular environment.

The structural\nchanges are directly correlated with the temperature dependence of the\nmagnetization. Fe70Cr10B20 crystallizes following a two-step process: an\neutectic crystallization of alfa-Fe (bcc) and the metastable tetragonal phase\n(Fe0.8Cr0.2)3B followed by another eutectic transformation to the stable phase\n(Fe0.75Cr0.25)2B and more segregation of alfa-Fe. These tetragonal phases are\nmagnetically anisotropic, giving rise to a large increase of the coercivity.\nThis behaviour is similar to that of Fe80B20 alloys, with Cr atoms replacing\nthe Fe positions in both crystalline phases. Fe80Zr10B10 shows also a two-step\nprocess in which two polymorphic transformations take place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2008 15:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-08"}

I show the rotation curves for a family of fiducial bulges with Sersic\nsurface brightness profiles and with various concentrations and intrinsic axis\nratios. Both parameters have a profound impact on the shape of the rotation\ncurve. In particular, I show how the peak rotation velocity, as well as the\nradius where it is reached, depend on both parameters.\n  I also discuss the implications of the flattening of a bulge for the\ndecomposition of a rotation curve and use the case of NGC 5533 to show the\nerrors that result from neglecting it. For NGC 5533, neglecting the flattening\nof the bulge leads to an overestimate of its mass-to-light ratio by\napproximately 30% and an underestimate of the contributions from the stellar\ndisc and dark matter halo in the regions outside the bulge-dominated area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2008 15:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
