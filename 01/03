Coupled with observations of\nclose interactions between dissolution pits and stylolitic peaks, these data\nillustrate a possible mechanism for stylolite formation. The complex geometry\nof stylolite surfaces is imposed by the interplay between the development of\ndissolution peaks in preferential locations (fast dissolution pits) and the\nmechanical properties of the solid-fluid-solid interfaces. Simple mechanical\nmodeling expresses the crucial competition that could rule the development of\nmicrostylolites: (i) a stress-related process, modeled in terms of the\nstiffness of springs that activate the heterogeneous dissolution rates of the\nsolid interface, promotes the deflection. In parallel, (ii) the strength of the\nsolid interface, modeled in terms of the stiffness of a membrane, is equivalent\nto a surface tension that limits the deflection and opposes its development.\nThe modeling produces stylolitic surfaces with characteristic geometries\nvarying from conical to columnar when both the effect of dissolution-rate\nheterogeneity and the strength properties of the rock are taken into account.

As a consequence, the pore waters become more reactive, which\nleads to enhanced dissolution-precipitation processes and a modification of the\nmechanical and hydrological properties of the rock. This effect is especially\nimportant for limestones given that the solubility and reactivity of carbonates\nis strongly dependent on pH and the partial pressure of CO2. The main mechanism\nthat couples dissolution, precipitation and rock matrix deformation is commonly\nreferred to as intergranular pressure solution creep (IPS) or pervasive\npressure solution creep (PSC). This process involves dissolution at\nintergranular grain contacts subject to elevated stress, diffusion of dissolved\nmaterial in an intergranular fluid, and precipitation in pore spaces subject to\nlower stress. This leads to an overall and pervasive reduction in porosity due\nto both grain indentation and precipitation in pore spaces. The percolation of\nCO2-rich fluids may influence on-going compaction due to pressure solution and\ncan therefore potentially affect the reservoir and its long-term CO2 storage\ncapacity. We aim at quantifying this effect by using a 2D numerical model to\nstudy the coupling between dissolution-precipitation processes, local mass\ntransfer, and deformation of the rock over long time scales.
