In this paper we\nshow that the internal absorption of gamma-rays caused by interactions with\ndense narrow-band radiation fields in the vicinity of compact gamma-ray\nproduction regions can lead to the formation of gamma-ray spectra of an almost\narbitrary hardness. This allows significant relaxation of the current tight\nconstraints on particle acceleration and radiation models, although at the\nexpense of enhanced requirements to the available nonthermal energy budget. The\nlatter, however, is not a critical issue, as long as it can be largely\ncompensated by the Doppler boosting, assuming very large ($\\geq 30$) Doppler\nfactors of the relativistically moving gamma-ray production regions.

Cascading clusters of\nsub-populations are built from bottom up, with higher-level sub-populations\noptimising larger parts of the problem. Hence higher-level sub-populations\nsearch a larger search space with a lower resolution whilst lower-level\nsub-populations search a smaller search space with a higher resolution. The\neffects of different partner selection schemes amongst the agents on solution\nquality are examined for two multiple-choice optimisation problems. It is shown\nthat partnering strategies that exploit problem-specific knowledge are superior\nand can counter inappropriate (sub-) fitness measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2008 15:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2008 17:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}

Relativistic invariance is achieved by constructing a dynamical\nunitary representation of the Poincar\\'e group on the three-nucleon Hilbert\nspace. Based on a Malfliet-Tjon type interaction, observables for elastic and\nbreak-up scattering are calculated for projectile energies in the intermediate\nenergy range up to 2 GeV, and compared to their nonrelativistic counterparts.\nThe convergence of the multiple scattering series is investigated as a function\nof the projectile energy in different scattering observables and\nconfigurations.

We focus on devising methods to recover the infall mass\nand infall eccentricity of subhaloes from the properties of their tidally\nstripped material (i.e. tidal streams). Our analysis reveals that there is a\nrelation between the scatter of stream particles about the best-fit debris\nplane and the infall mass of the progenitor subhalo. This allows us to\nreconstruct the infall mass from the spread of its tidal debris in space. We\nalso find that the spread in radial velocities of the debris material (as\nmeasured by an observer located at the centre of the host) correlates with the\ninfall eccentricity of the subhalo, which allows us to reconstruct its orbital\nparameters. We devise an automated method to identify leading and trailing arms\nthat can, in principle at least, be applied to observations of stellar streams\nfrom satellite galaxies. This method is based on the energy distribution of\nmaterial in the tidal stream. Using this method, we show that the mass\nassociated with leading and trailing arms differ. While our analysis indicates\nthat tidal streams can be used to recover certain properties of their\nprogenitor subhaloes (and consequently satellites), we do not find strong\ncorrelations between host halo properties and stream properties. This likely\nreflects the complicated relationship between the stream and the host, which in\na cosmological context is characterised by a complex mass accretion history, an\nasymmetric mass distribution and the abundance of substructure.
