These fixed-angle chains can serve as models of protein\nbackbones. The corresponding problem in 3D is open. We show that three special\ncases of particular relevance to the protein model are solvable in polynomial\ntime. When all link lengths and all angles are equal, the maximum 3D span is\nachieved in a flat configuration and can be computed in constant time. When all\nangles are equal and the chain is simple (non-self-crossing), the maximum flat\nspan can be found in linear time. In 3D, when all angles are equal to 90 deg\n(but the link lengths arbitrary), the maximum 3D span is in general nonplanar\nbut can be found in quadratic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2008 04:17:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 12:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-03"}

We discuss new types of pinwheel torques, which are\nsystematic torques arising from infrared emission and torques arising from the\ninteraction of grains with ions and electrons in hot plasma. We show that both\ntypes of torques are long-lived, i.e. may exist longer than gaseous damping\ntime. We compare these torques with the torques introduced by E.

These reaction networks are open systems of chemical reactions\nwith no zero-order reaction rates systems. They are characterized by at least\ntwo stationary points, one of which is a nonzero stable point, and one unstable\ntrivial solution (stability based on a linear stability analysis of the\ndeterministic system). Starting from a nonzero initial condition, the\ndeterministic system never reaches the zero stationary point due to its\nunstable nature. In contrast, the result presented here proves that this\nzero-state is the only stable stationary state for the discrete stochastic\nsystem. This result generalizes previous theoretical studies and simulations of\nspecific systems and provides a theoretical basis for analyzing a class of\nsystems that exhibit such inconsistent behavior. This result has implications\nin the simulation of infection, apoptosis, and population kinetics, as it can\nbe shown that for certain models the stochastic simulations will always yield\ndifferent predictions for the mean behavior than the deterministic simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2008 07:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-03"}

We demonstrate that the\nconductance variance $<[\\delta G]^2>$ is very sensitive to the elastic\nscattering breaking the valley symmetry. In the absence of such scattering\n(disorder potential smooth at atomic scales, trigonal warping negligible), the\nvariance $<[\\delta G]^2 > = 4 < [\\delta G]^2 >_\\text{metal}$ is four times\ngreater than that in conventional metals, which is due to the two-fold valley\ndegeneracy.

Only in the limit of strong intervalley scattering $<[\\delta\nG]^2 > = < [\\delta G]^2 >_\\text{metal}$. Our theory explains recent numerical\nresults and can be used for comparison with existing experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2008 15:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-25"}
