For each of the two accretion time\nscales we considered, we performed three simulations. In two of the three\nsimulations, we stop the accretion onto the planet once its mass becomes\ncharacteristic of that of Saturn or Jupiter. In the remaining case, the planet\ncan accrete disc material freely in such a way that its mass becomes higher\nthan Jupiter's. The simulations show different outcomes depending on the final\nmass m_p of the giant. For m_p=1 M_S (where M_S is Saturn's mass), we find that\nthe planet migrates inward through its interaction with the disc until its\neccentricity becomes high enough to induce a torque reversal. The planet then\nmigrates outward, and the system remains stable on long time scales. For m_p >\n1 M_J (where M_J is Jupiter's mass) we observed two different outcomes. In each\ncase the planet enters the 4:1 resonance with the binary, and resonant\ninteraction drives up the eccentricity of the planet until it undergoes a close\nencounter with the secondary star. The result can either be ejection from the\nsystem or scattering out into the disc followed by a prolonged period of\noutward migration. These results suggest that circumbinary planets are more\nlikely to be quite common in the Saturn-mass range. Jupiter-mass circumbinary\nplanets are likely to be less common because of their less stable evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2008 16:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The jet has been investigated by means of near-IR H2 and\n[FeII] narrow-band imaging, high resolution spectroscopy of the 1-0S(1) line\n(2.12 um), NIR (0.9-2.5 um) low resolution spectroscopy, along with ISO-SWS and\nLWS spectra (from 2.4 to 200 um). The flow shows a complex morphology. In\naddition to the large-scale jet precession presented in previous studies, we\ndetect a small-scale wiggling close to the source, that may indicate the\npresence of a multiple system. The peak radial velocities of the H2 knots range\nfrom -42 to -14 km s^-1 in the blue lobe, and from -8 to 47 km s^-1 in the red\nlobe. The low resolution spectra are rich in H_2 emission, and relatively faint\n[FeII] (NIR), [OI] and [CII] (FIR) emission is observed in the region close to\nthe source. A warm H2 gas component has an average excitation temperature that\nranges between 2000 K and 2500 K. Additionally, the ISO-SWS spectrum reveals\nthe presence of a cold component (520 K), that strongly contributes to the\nradiative cooling of the flow and plays a major role in the dynamics of the\nflow. The estimated L(H2) of the jet is 8.2+/-0.7 L_sun, suggesting that\nIRAS20126+4104 has an accretion rate significantly increased compared to\nlow-mass YSOs. This is also supported by the derived mass flux rate from the H2\nlines (Mflux(H2)~7.5x10^-4 M_sun yr^-1). The comparison between the H2 and the\noutflow parameters strongly indicates that the jet is driving, at least\npartially, the outflow. As already found for low-mass protostellar jets, the\nmeasured H2 outflow luminosity is tightly related to the source bolometric\nluminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2008 16:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Fast-drift structures and continuum bursts are also observed in\nassociation with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), not only flares. Methods: We\nanalyse radio spectral features and images acquired at radio, H-alpha, EUV, and\nsoft X-ray wavelengths, during an event close to the solar limb on 2 June 2003.\nResults: The fast-drifting decimetric-metric radio burst corresponds to a\nmoving, wide emission front in the radio images, which is normally interpreted\nas a signature of a propagating shock wave. A decimetric-metric type II burst\nwhere only the second harmonic lane is visible could explain the observations.\nAfter long-lasting activity in the active region, the hot and dense loops could\nbe absorbing or suppressing emission at the fundamental plasma frequency. The\nobserved burst speed suggests a super-Alfvenic velocity for the burst driver.\nThe expanding and opening loops, associated with the flare and the early phase\nof CME lift-off, could be driving the shock. Alternatively, an instantaneous\nbut fast loop expansion could initiate a freely propagating shock wave. The\nlater, complex-looking decametre-hectometre wave type III bursts indicate the\nexistence of a propagating shock, although no interplanetary type II burst was\nobserved during the event. The data does not support CME bow shock or a shock\nat the flanks of the CME as the origin of the fast-drift decimetric-metric\nradio source. Therefore super-Alfvenic loop expansion is the best candidate for\nthe initiation of the shock wave, and this result challenges the current view\nof metric/coronal shocks originating either in the flanks of CMEs or from flare\nblast waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2008 17:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-26"}

In this case the tomographic imaging of complex multielectron\nsystems may be obscured. We employ a time-dependent density functional model of\nC60 and show that with increasing laser wavelength the dynamics becomes more\nand more single active electron-like, suggesting that long wavelengths are to\nbe preferred for imaging purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2008 20:43:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2008 17:53:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2008 17:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We use 2D stellar models and a 2D finite\ndifference integration of the linearized pulsation equations to calculate\nnon-radial oscillations. This approach allows us to directly calculate the\npulsation modes for a distorted rotating star without treating the rotation as\na perturbation. We are also able to express the finite difference solution in\nthe horizontal direction as a sum of multiple spherical harmonics for any given\nmode. Using these methods, we have investigated the effects of increasing\nrotation and the number of spherical harmonics on the calculated\neigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions and compared the results to perturbation\ntheory. In slowly rotating stars, current methods work well, and we show that\nthe eigenfunction can be accurately modelled using 2nd order perturbation\ntheory and a single spherical harmonic. We use 10 Msun models with velocities\nranging from 0 to 420 km/s (0.89 Omega_c) and examine low order p modes.

X, a reciprocating\nfunction r is constructed, based only on the distribution of X, such that the\nconditional distribution of X given the (at-most-)two-point set {X,r(X)} is the\nzero-mean distribution on this set; in fact, a more general construction\nwithout the continuity assumption is given in this paper, as well as a large\nvariety of other related results, including characterizations of the\nreciprocating function and modeling distribution asymmetry patterns. The\nmentioned disintegration of zero-mean r.v.'s implies, in particular, that an\narbitrary zero-mean distribution is represented as the mixture of two-point\nzero-mean distributions; moreover, this mixture representation is most\nsymmetric in a variety of senses. Somewhat similar representations -- of any\nprobability distribution as the mixture of two-point distributions with the\nsame skewness coefficient (but possibly with different means) -- go back to\nKolmogorov; very recently, Aizenman et al. further developed such\nrepresentations and applied them to (anti-)concentration inequalities for\nfunctions of independent random variables and to spectral localization for\nrandom Schroedinger operators. One kind of application given in the present\npaper is to construct certain statistical tests for asymmetry patterns and for\nlocation without symmetry conditions. Exact inequalities implying conservative\nproperties of such tests are presented. These developments extend results\nestablished earlier by Efron, Eaton, and Pinelis under a symmetry condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2008 00:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

We also consider cases where\nangular momentum at large radii is latitude- and azimuth-dependent. For the\nlatitude-dependent angular momentum, 3-D simulations confirm axisymmetric\nresults: the material that has too much angular momentum to be accreted forms a\nthick torus near the equator. Consequently, accretion proceeds only through the\npolar funnel, and the mass accretion rate through the funnel is constrained by\nthe size and shape of the torus, not by the outer conditions. In 3-D\nsimulations, we found that the torus precesses, even for axisymmetric\nconditions at large radii.

We find that the IR behaviour of SN 2006jc can\nbe explained as a combination of IR echoes from two manifestations of\ncircumstellar material. The bulk of the near-IR emission arises from an IR echo\nfrom newly-condensed dust in a cool dense shell (CDS) produced by the\ninteraction of the ejecta outward shock with a dense shell of circumstellar\nmaterial ejected by the progenitor in a luminous blue variable (LBV) like\noutburst about two years prior to the SN explosion.

The mass of the\npre-existing CSM dust is at least ~8 x 10^(-3) M(solar).
