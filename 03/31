The actual CPU\ntime spent by each MPI task on previous time-step is used to adjust boundaries\nfor the next time-step. For a typical decomposition of 5^3 domains, the number\nof possible changes in boundaries is 3^{84}.

At the\nbeginning of a zero-level time-step, domains create and exchange large\nparticles. Then each domain advances all its particles for many small\ntime-steps. At the end of the large step, the domains decide where to place new\nboundaries and re-distribute particles.

These photons thus can heat or cool electrons at other\nradii via Compton scattering. This effect has been ignored in most previous\nworks on hot accretion flows and is the focus of this paper. If the mass\naccretion rate is described by $\\dot{M}=\\dot{M}_0(r/r_{\\rm out})^{0.3}$ and\n$r_{\\rm out}=10^4r_{\\rm s}$, we find that the Compton scattering will play a\ncooling and heating role at $r\\la 5\\times 10^3 r_{\\rm s}$ and $r\\ga 5\\times\n10^3 r_{\\rm s}$, respectively. Specifically, when $\\dot{M}_0>0.1L_{\\rm\nEdd}/c^2$, the Compton cooling rate is larger than the local viscous heating\nrate at certain radius; therefore the cooling effect is important. When\n$\\dot{M}_0>2L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$, the heating effect at $r_{\\rm out}$ is important.\nWe can obtain the self-consistent steady solution with the global Compton\neffect included only if $\\dot{M}_0\\la L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$ for $r_{\\rm\nout}=50r_{\\rm s}$, which corresponds to $L\\la 0.02L_{\\rm Edd}$. Above this rate\nthe Compton cooling is so strong at the inner region that hot solutions can not\nexist. On the other hand, for $r_{\\rm out}= 10^5r_{\\rm s}$, we can only get the\nself-consistent solution when $\\dot{M}_0\\la L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$ and $L<0.01L_{\\rm\nEdd}$. Above this accretion rate the equilibrium temperature of electrons at\n$r_{\\rm out}$ is higher than the virial temperature as a result of strong\nCompton heating, so the accretion is suppressed. In this case the activity of\nthe black hole will likely \"oscillate\" between an active and an inactive\nphases, with the oscillation timescale being the radiative timescale of the gas\nat $r_{\\rm out}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2008 05:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2008 05:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We first focus on gap\nprobabilities on the real axis, i.e. the probability that these polynomials\nhave no real root in a given interval. For generalized Kac polynomials, indexed\nby an integer d, of large degree n, one finds that the probability of no real\nroot in the interval [0,1] decays as a power law n^{-\\theta(d)} where \\theta(d)\n> 0 is the persistence exponent of the diffusion equation with random initial\nconditions in spatial dimension d. For n \\gg 1 even, the probability that they\nhave no real root on the full real axis decays like\nn^{-2(\\theta(2)+\\theta(d))}. For Weyl polynomials and Binomial polynomials,\nthis probability decays respectively like \\exp{(-2\\theta_{\\infty}} \\sqrt{n})\nand \\exp{(-\\pi \\theta_{\\infty} \\sqrt{n})} where \\theta_{\\infty} is such that\n\\theta(d) = 2^{-3/2} \\theta_{\\infty} \\sqrt{d} in large dimension d. We also\nshow that the probability that such polynomials have exactly k roots on a given\ninterval [a,b] has a scaling form given by \\exp{(-N_{ab} \\tilde\n\\phi(k/N_{ab}))} where N_{ab} is the mean number of real roots in [a,b] and\n\\tilde \\phi(x) a universal scaling function. We develop a simple Mean Field\n(MF) theory reproducing qualitatively these scaling behaviors, and improve\nsystematically this MF approach using the method of persistence with partial\nsurvival, which in some cases yields exact results. Finally, we show that the\nprobability density function of the largest absolute value of the real roots\nhas a universal algebraic tail with exponent {-2}. These analytical results are\nconfirmed by detailed numerical computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2008 08:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This\nstability was achieved by the european grid system and a large flexible and\nreliable spare power plant capacity. This system allowed a continuous demand\ngrowth during the past 10-20 years of up to a few % per year. However,\npartially due to this overcapacity, no new large power plants have been\ncompleted during the past 10-15 years. The obvious consequence is that the\nreliable spare capacity has been reduced and that a further yearly demand\ngrowth of 1-2% for electric energy can only be achieved if new power plants\nwill be constructed soon. Data from various European countries, provided by the\nUCTE, indicate that the system stress during peak load times and especially\nduring particular cold winter days is much larger than generally assumed. In\nfact, the latest UCTE data on reliable power capacity indicate that already\nduring the Winter 2007/8 only a few very cold winter days in Western Europe\ncould have resulted in very unpleasant supply problems during the early evening\npeak load times in France and the neighboring countries.\n  An analysis of the potential to build and operate new power plants\ndemonstrates that no short term solution, which allows a further continuous\n1-2% consumption growth seems to exist. Thus, without any action from the\nvarious governments in Europe to reduce the electricity demand in a serious\nway, the risk of blackouts will increase dramatically in the near future.\nInstead of simply waiting for the blackout disaster to happen, a few simple\nshort term political actions are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2008 10:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-01"}

Because of the\nlow-ionisation fraction in molecular clouds, neutral and charged particles are\nweakly coupled. Ambipolar diffusion then plays an important role in the\nformation process. A quiescent, uniform plasma is perturbed by a fast-mode\nwave. Using 2D numerical simulations, we follow the evolution of the fast-mode\nwave. The simulations are done with a multifluid, adaptive mesh refinement MHD\ncode. Initial perturbations with wavelengths that are 2 orders of magnitude\nlarger than the dissipation length are strongly affected by the ion-neutral\ndrift. Only in situations where there are large variations in the magnetic\nfield corresponding to a highly turbulent gas can fast-mode waves generate\ndense cores. This means that, in most cores, no substructure can be produced.\nHowever, Core D of TMC-1 is an exception to this case. Due to its atypically\nhigh ionisation fraction, waves with wavelengths up to 3 orders of magnitude\ngreater than the dissipation length can be present. Such waves are only weakly\naffected by ambipolar diffusion and can produce dense substructure without\nlarge wave-amplitudes.

However, the FP\nhas been found to be tilted against the simple virial expectation, prompting\ndebates on its origin. In order to investigate the contribution of systematic\nstellar population variation to the FP tilt, we study here the FP relations of\nearly-type galaxies in mid-infrared (MIR) which may represent the stellar mass\nwell.

By comparison with a so-called Earth\nsystem model of intermediate complexity (CLIMBER-2), in which the events\nrepresent oscillations between two climate states corresponding to two\nfundamentally different modes of deep-water formation in the North Atlantic, we\ndemonstrate that the conceptual model captures fundamental aspects of the\nnonlinearity of the events in that model.

On the other hand, Vassiliev works\ngives another way to study link invariant, by generalizing them to singular\nlinks i.e. links with a finite number of rigid transverse double points. The\nfirst part of this thesis deals with a possible relation between these two\napproaches in the case of the Alexander polynomial. To this purpose, we extend\ngrid presentation for links to singular links. Then we use it to generalize\nOzsvath and Szabo invariant to singular links.

This work can be considered as\na first step toward a categorification of Vassiliev theory. In a second part,\nwe give a refinement of Khovanov homology to restricted links. Restricted links\nare link diagrams up to a restricted set of Reidemeister moves. In particular,\nclosed braids can be seen as a subset of them. Such a refinement give then a\nnew tool for studying knots and their deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2008 15:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-01"}
