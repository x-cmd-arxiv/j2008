This happens even though the neutrino mass-squared differences are\nmeasured to be small, and even when neutrino self-coupling is sub-dominant.

Using our\nstrong gravitational lensing model presented in Bradac et al. (2006), we find\nthat the magnifications are 10 to 50 for the three images of the galaxy. The\nimplied infrared luminosity is consistent with the galaxy being a LIRG, with a\nstellar mass of M_*~2e11 M_Sun and a star formation rate of ~90 M_Sun/yr. With\nlensed fluxes at 24 microns of 0.58 mJy and 0.39 mJy in the two brightest\nimages, this galaxy presents a unique opportunity for detailed study of an\nobscured starburst with star fomation rate comparable to that of L* galaxies at\nz>2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 19:42:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2008 19:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Single-stranded DNA has been employed to make these\ndesirable properties accessible for large scale fabrication of devices. Because\nsingle-stranded DNA can helically wrap a SWNT, forming a stable hybrid\nstructure, DNA/polymer wrapping has been used to disperse bundles of\nintrinsically hydrophobic SWNTs into individual tubes in aqueous solution. The\nability to isolate individual tubes, make them soluble, and separate them\naccording to symmetry would enable fabrication of SWNT optoelectronic devices\nthat benefit from the unique electronic properties of specific nanotube\nstructures. Envisioning optoelectronic applications of nanotubes, we\ninvestigate whether the optical properties of DNA-wrapped SWNT materials are\ndifferent than those of pristine SWNTs.

Successive randomly distributed and\nclustered SNe explosions cause the formation of hot superbubbles that drive\neither fountains or galactic winds above the galactic disk, depending on the\namount and concentration of energy that is injected by the SNe. In a galactic\nfountain, the ejected gas is re-captured by the gravitational potential and\nfalls back onto the disk. From 3D nonequilibrium radiative cooling\nhydrodynamical simulations of these fountains, we find that they may reach\naltitudes up to about 5 kpc in the halo and thus allow for the formation of the\nso called intermediate-velocity-clouds (IVCs) which are often observed in the\nhalos of disk galaxies. The high-velocity-clouds that are also observed but at\nhigher altitudes (of up to 12 kpc) require another mechanism to explain their\nproduction. We argue that they could be formed either by the capture of gas\nfrom the intergalactic medium and/or by the action of magnetic fields that are\ncarried to the halo with the gas in the fountains. Due to angular momentum\nlosses to the halo, we find that the fountain material falls back to smaller\nradii and is not largely spread over the galactic disk. Instead, the SNe ejecta\nfall nearby the region where the fountain was produced, a result which is\nconsistent with recent chemical models of the galaxy. The fall back material\nleads to the formation of new generations of molecular clouds and to supersonic\nturbulence feedback in the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 22:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

It appears that the\nyoungest pulsars have the most disordered subpulses and the subpulses become\nmore and more organized into drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages.

If the hot ICM is nearly isothermal in the projected\nregion of interest, the X-ray temperature inferred from a broad-band (0.7-7.0\nkeV) spectrum should be identical to the X-ray temperature inferred from a\nhard-band (2.0-7.0 keV) spectrum. However, if unresolved cool lumps of gas are\ncontributing soft X-ray emission, the temperature of a best-fit\nsingle-component thermal model will be cooler for the broad-band spectrum than\nfor the hard-band spectrum. Using this difference as a diagnostic, the ratio of\nbest-fitting hard-band and broad-band temperatures may indicate the presence of\ncooler gas even when the X-ray spectrum itself may not have sufficient\nsignal-to-noise to resolve multiple temperature components. To test this\npossible diagnostic, we extract X-ray spectra from core-excised annular regions\nfor each cluster in our archival sample. We compare the X-ray temperatures\ninferred from single-temperature fits when the energy range of the fit is\n0.7-7.0 keV (broad) and when the energy range is 2.0/(1+z)-7.0 keV (hard).

We also take into consideration the\nmagnitude of the GdFeO3-type orthorhombic lattice distortion, which is large\nand small in Y1-xCaxVO3 and La1-xSrxVO3, respectively, and discuss its effect\non the evolution of charge dynamics. The optical conductivity spectra show that\nthe doped hole is well localized and forms the small polaron like state. The\nhole dynamics in Y1-xCaxVO3 is nearly isotropic up to the doping level of the\norbital order-disorder transition, while that in La1-xSrxVO3 is anisotropic in\nthe lightly doped region due to the one-dimensional orbital exchange\ninteraction. The possible origin of the difference in the hole dynamics is\ndiscussed in terms of the local lattice distortion, which is induced by the\nformation of the small polaron like state and becomes more significant for the\nreduced one-electron bandwidth. In addition, the optical Mott-gap excitation in\nthe nominally C-type spin and $G$-type orbital ordered phase is distinct from\nthat for La1-xSrxVO3 in its intensity and spectral shape. This suggests that\nthe orthorhombic lattice distortion enhances the modification of the spin and\norbital ordering from the pure C-type and G-type, respectively.

Opinion formation is a complex\nprocess and a realistic model should also take into account the important\nfeedbacks that the opinions of the agents have on the structure of the social\nnetworks and on the characteristics of the opinion dynamics. In this paper we\nwill show that associating to different agents different kinds of\ninterconnections and different interacting behaviours can lead to interesting\nscenarios, like the coexistence of several opinion clusters, namely pluralism.\nIn our model agents have opinions uniformly and continuously distributed\nbetween two extremes. The social network is formed through a social aggregation\nmechanism including the segregation process of the extremists that results in\nmany real communities. We show how this process affects the opinion dynamics in\nthe whole society. In the opinion evolution we consider the different\npredisposition of single individuals to interact and to exchange opinion with\neach other; we associate to each individual a different tolerance threshold,\ndepending on its own opinion: extremists are less willing to interact with\nindividuals with strongly different opinions and to change significantly their\nideas. A general result is obtained: when there is no interaction restriction,\nthe opinion always converges to uniformity, but the same is happening whenever\na strong segregation process of the extremists occurs. Only when extremists are\nforming clusters but these clusters keep interacting with the rest of the\nsociety, the survival of a wide opinion range is guaranteed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2008 10:17:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2008 10:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2008 12:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-15"}

We begin by presenting a general\nframework, in which the set of genes in a functional category is compared to\nthe complementary set of genes on the array. The framework includes tests for\noverrepresentation of a category within a list of significant genes, and\nmethods that consider continuous measures of differential expression. Existing\ntests are divided into two classes. Class 1 tests assume gene-specific measures\nof differential expression are independent, despite overwhelming evidence of\npositive correlation. Analytic and simulated results are presented that\ndemonstrate Class 1 tests are strongly anti-conservative in practice. Class 2\ntests account for gene correlation, typically through array permutation that by\nconstruction has proper Type I error control for the induced null. However,\nboth Class 1 and Class 2 tests use a null hypothesis that all genes have the\nsame degree of differential expression. We introduce a more sensible and\ngeneral (Class 3) null under which the profile of differential expression is\nthe same within the category and complement. Under this broader null, Class 2\ntests are shown to be conservative.

The worthiness of all\ncomponents in the schedule has to be continuously demonstrated in order for\nthem to remain there. This demonstration employs a dynamic evaluation function\nwhich evaluates how well each component contributes towards the final\nobjective.

The real accretion flow was found to be\ntime-dependent and turbulent. This paper presents the minimal MHD spherical\naccretion model that separately deals with turbulence. Treatment of turbulence\nis based on simulations of several regimes of collisional MHD. The effects of\nfreezing-in amplification, dissipation, dynamo action, isotropization, and\nconstant magnetic helicity are self-consistently included. The assumptions of\nequipartition and magnetic field isotropy are released. Correct dynamics of\nmagnetized flow is calculated. Diffusion, convection, and radiation are not\naccounted for. Two different types of Radiatively Inefficient accretion flows\nare found: a transonic non-rotating flow (I), a flow with effective transport\nof angular momentum outward (II). Non-rotating flow has an accretion rate\nseveral times smaller than Bondi rate, because turbulence inhibits accretion.\nFlow with angular momentum transport has accretion rate about 10-100 times\nsmaller than Bondi rate. The effects of highly helical turbulence, states of\nouter magnetization, and different equations of state are discussed. The flows\nwere found to be convectively stable on average, despite gas entropy increases\ninward. The proposed model has a small number of free parameters and the\nfollowing attractive property. Inner density in the non-rotating magnetized\nflow was found to be several times lower than density in a non-magnetized\naccretion. Still several times lower density is required to explain the\nobserved low IR luminosity and low Faraday rotation measure of accretion onto\nSgr A*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2008 12:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is able to categorize all cells (or\nmolecules) within the body as self-cells or non-self cells. It does this with\nthe help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action\nfrom a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical\nmessengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune\nsystem. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and\ndestroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds\nto previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can\nremain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information\nprocessing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in\nrecent years. A novel computational intelligence technique, inspired by\nimmunology, has emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several concepts\nfrom the immune have been extracted and applied for solution to real world\nscience and engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the\nimmune system metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune Systems\nmethods. We will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable for\nArtificial Immune Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough for one\nsuch problem. A comparison of the Artificial Immune Systems to other well-known\nalgorithms, areas for future work, tips & tricks and a list of resources will\nround this tutorial off.

We use a library of templates computed with PEGASE.2 to fit their\nmultiwavelength photometry and derive their stellar continuum. Subtraction of\nthe stellar continuum enables us to detect in 5 galaxies a significant excess\nin the IRAC band pass where the 3.3 um PAH is expected. We then assess if the\nphysical origin of the IRAC excess is due to an obscured active galactic\nnucleus (AGN) or warm dust emission. For one galaxy evidence of an obscured AGN\nis found, while the remaining four do not exhibit any significant AGN activity.\nPossible contamination by warm dust continuum of unknown origin as found in the\nGalactic diffuse emission is discussed. The properties of such a continuum\nwould have to be different from the local Universe to explain the measured IRAC\nexcess, but we cannot definitively rule out this possibility until its origin\nis understood. Assuming that the IRAC excess is dominated by the 3.3 um PAH\nfeature, we find good agreement with the observed 11.3 um PAH line flux arising\nfrom the same C-H bending and stretching modes, consistent with model\nexpectations. Finally, the IRAC excess appears to be correlated with the\nstar-formation rate in the galaxies.

In this\ncontribution, we present a theoretical comparison of three different types of\nunimolecular rectifiers: i) systems where the donor- and acceptor-part of the\nmolecules are taken from charge-transfer salt components; ii) zwitterionic\nsystems; and iii) Tour wires with nitro substituents.

We put a particular emphasis on the prediction\nof rectification ratios (RR), which are crucial for the assessment of the\ntechnological usefulness of single molecule junctions as diodes. We also\ncompare our results with values reported in the literature for other types of\nmolecular rectification, where the essential asymmetry is not induced by the\nstructure of the molecule alone but either by a difference in the electronic\ncoupling of the molecule to the two electrodes or by attaching alkyl chains of\ndifferent lengths to the central molecular moiety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2008 14:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-28"}

One of the important features of the LHT model is\nthe existence of new source of FC interactions between the SM fermions and the\nmirror fermions. These FC interactions can make significant loop-level\ncontributions to the couplings $tcV$, and furthermore enhance the cross\nsections of the FC single-top quark production processes. In this paper, we\nstudy some FC single-top quark production processes, $pp\\to t\\bar{c}$ and\n$pp\\to tV$, at the LHC in the LHT model.

The observation of these FC processes at the LHC is certainly the clue\nof new physics, and further precise measurements of the cross scetions can\nprovide useful information about the free parameters in the LHT model,\nspecially about the mirror quark masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2008 15:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-14"}
