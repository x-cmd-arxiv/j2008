Observations of emission\nlines from edge-wise shocks in SNRs can constrain the gas velocity and\ncollisionless electron heating at the shock front. Downstream hydrogen atoms\nengage in charge transfer, excitation and ionization reactions, defining an\ninteraction region called the shock transition zone. The properties of hot\nhydrogen atoms produced by charge transfers (called broad neutrals) are\ncritical for accurately calculating the structure and radiation from the shock\ntransition zone. This paper is the third in a series describing the kinetic,\nfluid and emission properties of Balmer-dominated shocks, and is the first to\nproperly treat the effect of broad neutral kinetics on shock transition zone\nstructure. We use our models to extract shock parameters from observations of\nBalmer-dominated SNRs. We find that inferred shock velocities and electron\ntemperatures are lower than those of previous calculations by <10% for v_s<1500\nkm/s, and by 10-30% for v_s>1500 km/s. This effect is primarily due to the fact\nthat excitation by proton collisions and charge transfer to excited levels\nfavor the high speed part of the neutral hydrogen velocity distribution. Our\nresults have a strong dependence on the ratio of electron to proton\ntemperatures, \\beta=T_e/T_p, which allows us to construct a relation \\beta(v_s)\nbetween the temperature ratio and shock velocity.

This property consists in the existence of an ultimate lower\nlimit l* to the thickness of the slices for which a statistical-mechanical\ndescription is viable, depending l* on the thermodynamical variables which\ndefine the state of the system locally. This limiting scale, found to be in\ngeneral much larger than the Planck scale (so that no Planck scale physics must\nbe necessarily invoked to justify it), appears not related to gravity and this\nsuggests that the generalized entropy bound is likely to be rooted on\nconventional flat-spacetime statistical mechanics, with the maximum admitted\nentropy being however actually determined also by gravity.\n  Some examples of ideal fluids are considered in order to identify the\nmechanisms which can set a lower limit to the statistical-mechanical\ndescription and these systems are found to respect the lower limiting scale l*.\nThe photon gas, in particular, appears to seemingly saturate this limiting\nscale and the consequence is drawn that for systems consisting of a single\nslice of a photon gas with thickness l*, the generalized Bousso bound is\nsaturated. It is argued that this seems to open the way to a peculiar\nunderstanding of black hole entropy: if an entropy can meaningfully (i.e. with\na second law) be assigned to a black hole, the value A/4 for it (where A is the\narea of the black hole) is required simply by (conventional) statistical\nmechanics coupled to general relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2008 16:10:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2008 09:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Experiments on lateral spreading of receptor\nactivity into ligand-free regions challenge the current standard models of EGFR\nactivation. Here, we propose and study a theoretical model, which explains\nspreading into ligand-free regions without introducing any new, unknown kinetic\nparameters. The model exhibits bistability of activity, induced by a generic\nreaction mechanism, which consists of activation via dimerization and\ndeactivation via a Michaelis-Menten reaction. It possesses slow propagating\nfront solutions and faster initial transients. We analyze relevant experiments\nand find that they are in quantitative accordance with the fast initial modes\nof spreading, but not with the slow propagating front. We point out that\nlateral spreading of activity is linked to pathological levels of persistent\nreceptor activity as observed in cancer cells and exemplify uses of this link\nfor the design and quick evaluation of molecular therapies targeting primary\nactivation of EGFR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2008 17:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-19"}

We aim to test an alternative\nmodel in which absorption creates the observed spectral shape, explains the\npuzzling lack of variability of the red wing and reduces the high reflection\nalbedo, substantially greater than unity, that is otherwise inferred at\nenergies E > 20 keV. We compiled all the available long-exposure, high-quality\ndata for MCG-6-30-15: 522 ks of Chandra HETGS, 282 ks of XMM-Newton pn/RGS and\n253 ks of Suzaku XIS/PIN data. This is the first analysis of this full dataset.\nWe investigated the spectral variability on timescales >20 ks using principal\ncomponents analysis and fitted spectral models to \"flux state\" and mean spectra\nover the energy range 0.5-45 keV (depending on detector). The absorber model\nwas based on the zones previously identified in the high-resolution grating\ndata. Joint fits were carried out to any data that were simultaneous. Multiple\nabsorbing zones covering a wide range of ionisation are required by the grating\ndata, including a highly ionised outflowing zone. A variable partial-covering\nzone plus absorbed low-ionisation reflection, distant from the source, provides\na complete description of the variable X-ray spectrum. A single model fits all\nthe data. We conclude that these zones are responsible for the red wing, its\napparent lack of variability, the absorption structure around the Fe K-alpha\nline, the soft-band \"excess\" and the high flux seen in the hard X-ray band. A\nrelativistically-blurred Fe line is not required in this model.

On average, a Milky Way-sized galaxy has 3 subhalos with\nvmax>80km/s; 7 with vmax>60km/s; and 15 with vmax>40km/s merge at redshift z>1.\nAssuming isotropic accretion, a third of these merge at an impact angle <20\ndegrees and are dragged into the disc plane by dynamical friction. Their\naccreted stars and dark matter settle into a thick disc. The stellar thick disc\nqualitatively reproduces the observed thick disc at the solar neighbourhood,\nbut is less massive by a factor ~2-10. The dark matter disc contributes 0.25-1\ntimes the halo density at the solar position. Although not likely to be\ndynamically interesting, the dark disc has important implications for the\ndirect detection of dark matter because of its low velocity with respect to the\nEarth. Higher inclination encounters (>20 degrees) are twice as likely as low\ninclination ones. These lead to structures that closely resemble the recently\ndiscovered inner/outer stellar halos. They also do more damage to the Milky Way\nstellar disc creating a more pronounced flare, and warp; both long-lived and\nconsistent with current observations. The most massive mergers (vmax>80km/s)\nheat the thin disc enough to produce a thick disc. These heated thin disc stars\nare essential for obtaining a thick disc as massive as that seen in the Milky\nWay; they likely comprise some ~50-90% of the thick disc stars. The Milky Way\nthin disc must reform from fresh gas after z=1 [abridged].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2008 03:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2008 14:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We argue that cargo movement may result\nfrom its ability to perturb the existing motor distribution and to surf at the\nresulting shock waves separating regions of different motor densities within\nthe transient regime. In this case, the observed bidirectionality of cargo\nmovement is naturally associated with reversals of shocks directions.\nComparison of the quantitative results predicted by this model with available\ndata for cargo velocity allows us to suggest that geometrical characteristics\nof the transported particle shall determine the extension and intensity of the\nperturbation it produces and thus, its dynamics. Possible implications of these\nideas to virus movement at the cell body are discussed in connection with their\ndistinguished morphological characteristics.

The standard circuit model of quantum computing\nrequires a universal set of quantum logic gates for the implementation of\narbitrary quantum operations. As in classical models of computation, quantum\nerror correction techniques enable rectification of small imperfections in gate\noperations, thus allowing for perfect computation in the presence of noise. For\nfault-tolerant computation, it is commonly believed that error thresholds\nranging between 10^-4 and 10^-2 will be required depending on the noise model\nand the computational overhead for realizing the quantum gates. Up to now, all\nexperimental implementations have fallen short of these requirements. Here, we\nreport on a Molmer-Sorensen type gate operation entangling ions with a fidelity\nof 99.3(1)% which together with single-qubit operations forms a universal set\nof quantum gates. The gate operation is performed on a pair of qubits encoded\nin two trapped calcium ions using a single amplitude-modulated laser beam\ninteracting with both ions at the same time. A robust gate operation, mapping\nseparable states onto maximally entangled states is achieved by adiabatically\nswitching the laser-ion coupling on and off. We analyse the performance of a\nsingle gate and concatenations of up to 21 gate operations. The gate mechanism\nholds great promise not only for two-qubit but also for multi-qubit operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2008 13:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-29"}

The standard D3Q19\nlattice Boltzmann model is derived and explained in depth, followed by a\ndetailed discussion of complementary methods for the coupling of solvent and\nsolute. Colloidal dispersions are best described in terms of extended particles\nwith appropriate boundary conditions at the surfaces, while particles with\ninternal degrees of freedom are easier to simulate as an arrangement of mass\npoints with frictional coupling to the solvent. In both cases, particular care\nhas been taken to simulate thermal fluctuations in a consistent way. The\nusefulness of this methodology is illustrated by studies from our own research,\nwhere the dynamics of colloidal and polymeric systems has been investigated in\nboth equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2008 15:52:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2008 17:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
