Our goal is to estimate the timing\nerrors and CFOs of each active RSS.

The monitoring\nperiod covered two decades for RX Boo (1987 -- 2007) and 12 years for SV Peg\n(1990 -- 1995, 2000 -- 2007). In addition, maps were obtained of RX Boo with\nthe Very Large Array over several years. We find that most of the emission in\nthe circumstellar shell of RX Boo is located in an incomplete ring with an\ninner radius of 91 mas (15 AU). A velocity gradient is found in a NW--SE\ndirection. The maser region can be modelled as a shell with a thickness of 22\nAU, which is only partially filled. The gas crossing time is 16.5 years. The\nring-like structure and the velocity gradient remained stable for at least 11\nyears, while the maser line profiles varied strongly. This suggests that the\nspatial asymmetry is not accidental, so that either the mass loss process or\nthe maser excitation conditions in RX Boo are not spherically symmetric. The\nstrong variability of the maser spectral features is mainly due to incoherent\nintensity fluctuations of maser emission spots, which have lifetimes of the\norder of 1 year. We found no correlation between the optical and the maser\nvariability in either star. The variability properties of the SV Peg masers do\nnot differ substantially from those of RX Boo.

The resulting `imbalanced\nsuperfluid' has been realized experimentally for ultracold atomic gases with\ns-wave interactions. Inspired by high-temperature superconductivity, we\ninvestigate the case of d-wave interactions, and find marked differences from\nthe s-wave superfluid. Whereas s-wave imbalanced Fermi gases tend to phase\nseparate in real space, in a balanced condensate and an imbalanced normal halo,\nwe show that the d-wave gas can phase separate in reciprocal space so that\nimbalance and superfluidity can coexist spatially. We show that the mechanism\nexplaining this property is the creation of polarized excitations in the nodes\nof the gap. The Sarma mechanism, present only at nonzero temperatures for the\ns-wave case, is still applicable in the temperature zero limit for the d-wave\ncase. As a result, the d-wave BCS superfluid is more robust with respect to\nimbalance, and a region of the phase diagram can be identified where the s-wave\nBCS superfluidity is suppressed whereas the d-wave superfluidity is not. When\nthese results are extended into the BEC limit of strongly bound molecules, the\nsymmetry of the order parameter matters less. The effects of fluctuations\nbeyond mean field is taken into account in the calculation of the structure\nfactor and the critical temperature. The poles of the structure factor\n(corresponding to bound molecular states) are less damped in the d-wave case as\ncompared to s-wave. On the BCS side of the unitarity limit, the critical\ntemperature follows the temperature corresponding to the pair binding energy\nand as such will also be more robust against imbalance. Possible routes for the\nexperimental observation of the d-wave superfluidity have been discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Feb 2008 17:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-28"}

Nuclei propagating in\nthe intergalactic space are photo-disintegrated and decrease their Lorentz\nfactor due to the interaction with cosmic microwave background and\nextragalactic background light. We calculate the evolution trajectories in the\nbackward time, that describe how atomic mass number $A$ and Lorentz factor\n$\\Gamma$ change with redshift $z$. Three methods of spectra calculations are\ninvestigated and compared: {\\it (i)} trajectory method, {\\it(ii)} kinetic\nequation combined with trajectory calculations and {\\it (iii)} coupled kinetic\nequations. We believe that these three methods exhaust at least the principal\npossibilities for any analytic solution of the problem. In the most\nstraightforward method {\\it(i)} only trajectory calculations are used to\nconnect the observed nuclei flux with the production rate of primary\n(accelerated) nuclei $A_0$. In the second method {\\it (ii)} the flux (space\ndensity) of primary nuclei, and secondary nuclei and protons are calculated\nwith the help of kinetic equation and trajectories are used only to determine\nthe generation rates of these nuclei. The third method {\\it (iii)} consists in\nsolving the complete set of coupled kinetic equations, written starting with\nprimary nuclei $A_0$, then for $A_0-1$ etc down to the $A$ of interest. The\nsolution of the preceding equation gives the generation rate for the one which\nfollows. An important element of the calculations for all methods is the\nsystematic use of Lorentz factor instead of energy. We consider here the\ninteraction of nuclei only with the cosmic microwave background, this case is\nparticularly suitable for understanding the physical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Feb 2008 19:41:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 12:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2010 18:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2012 18:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

To better understand the formation, morphology and ordering of\nepitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs), it is essential to have an\naccurate model that can aid further experiments and predict the trends in SAQD\nformation. SAQDs form because of the destabilizing effect of elastic mismatch\nstrain, but most analytic models and some numerical models of SAQD formation\neither assume an elastically homogeneous anisotropic film-substrate system or\nassume an elastically heterogeneous isotropic system. In this work, we perform\nthe full film-substrate elastic calculation. Then we incorporate the elasticity\ncalculation into a stochastic linear growth model.

Motivated by recent claims\nthat the indirect coupling between magnetic moments in precessional motion has\na much longer range than its static counterpart, here we consider how magnetic\natoms adsorbed to the walls of a metallic nanotube respond to a time-dependent\nperturbation that induces their magnetic moments to precess.

Reasoning\nabout privacy, however, is fraught with pitfalls. One of the most significant\nis the auxiliary information (also called external knowledge, background\nknowledge, or side information) that an adversary gleans from other channels\nsuch as the web, public records, or domain knowledge. This paper explores how\none can reason about privacy in the face of rich, realistic sources of\nauxiliary information. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of\ncurrent anonymization schemes in preserving privacy when multiple organizations\nindependently release anonymized data about overlapping populations. 1. We\ninvestigate composition attacks, in which an adversary uses independent\nanonymized releases to breach privacy. We explain why recently proposed models\nof limited auxiliary information fail to capture composition attacks. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that even a simple instance of a composition attack can\nbreach privacy in practice, for a large class of currently proposed techniques.\nThe class includes k-anonymity and several recent variants. 2. On a more\npositive note, certain randomization-based notions of privacy (such as\ndifferential privacy) provably resist composition attacks and, in fact, the use\nof arbitrary side information. This resistance enables stand-alone design of\nanonymization schemes, without the need for explicitly keeping track of other\nreleases. We provide a precise formulation of this property, and prove that an\nimportant class of relaxations of differential privacy also satisfy the\nproperty. This significantly enlarges the class of protocols known to enable\nmodular design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Mar 2008 00:36:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2008 16:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

It is often preferred for the sake of its\nstability. We present TPILU(k), the first efficiently parallelized ILU(k)\npreconditioner that maintains this important stability property. Even better,\nTPILU(k) preconditioning produces an answer that is bit-compatible with the\nsequential ILU(k) preconditioning. In terms of performance, the TPILU(k)\npreconditioning is shown to run faster whenever more cores are made available\nto it --- while continuing to be as stable as sequential ILU(k). This is in\ncontrast to some competing methods that may become unstable if the degree of\nthread parallelism is raised too far. Where Block Jacobi ILU(k) fails in an\napplication, it can be replaced by TPILU(k) in order to maintain good\nperformance, while also achieving full stability. As a further optimization,\nTPILU(k) offers an optional level-based incomplete inverse method as a fast\napproximation for the original ILU(k) preconditioned matrix.
