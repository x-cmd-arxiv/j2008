The results are: (1) the population of strong MgII systems\n(W_0>2.0 Ang.) near cluster redshifts shows a significant (>3 sigma)\noverabundance (up to a factor of 15) when compared with the 'field' population;\n(2) the overabundance is more evident at smaller distances (d<1 Mpc) than\nlarger distances (d<2 Mpc) from the cluster center; and, (3) the population of\nweak MgII systems (W_0<0.3 Ang.) near cluster redshifts conform to the field\nstatistics. Unlike in the field, this dichotomy makes n(W) in clusters appear\nflat and well fitted by a power-law in the entire W-range. A sub-sample of the\nmost massive clusters yields a stronger and still significant signal. Since\neither the absorber number density or filling-factor/cross-section affects the\nabsorber statistics, an interesting possibility is that we have detected the\nsignature of truncated halos due to environmental effects.

This model emerges as a low-energy theory on\nthe worldsheet of the BPS-saturated flux tubes (strings) in N=2 supersymmetric\nQCD deformed by a superpotential of a special type breaking N=2 supersymmetry\ndown to N=1. Using large-N expansion we solve this model to the leading order\nin 1/N. Our solution exhibits spontaneous supersymmetry breaking for all values\nof the deformation parameter. We identify the Goldstino field. The discrete\nZ_{2N} symmetry is shown to be spontaneously broken down to Z_2; therefore, the\nworldsheet model has N strictly degenerate vacua (with nonvanishing vacuum\nenergy).

The curvature, synchrotron and inverse Compton\nradiation of both primary electrons and pairs produce a broad spectrum of\nemission from infra-red to GeV energies. Both primaries and pairs undergo\ncyclotron resonant absorption of radio photons, allowing them to maintain\nsignificant pitch angles. Synchrotron radiation from pairs with a power-law\nenergy spectrum with Lorentz factors 10^2 - 10^5, dominate the spectrum up to\n10 MeV. Synchrotron and curvature radiation of primaries dominates from 10 MeV\nup to a few GeV. We examine the energy-dependent pulse profiles and\nphase-resolved spectra for parameters of the Crab pulsar as a function of\nmagnetic inclination and viewing angle, comparing to broad-band data. In most\ncases, the pulse profiles are dominated by caustics on trailing field lines. We\nalso explore the relation of the high-energy and the radio profiles, as well as\nthe possibility of caustic formation in the radio cone emission. We find that\nthe Crab pulsar profiles and spectrum can be reasonably well reproduced by a\nmodel with viewing angle 45 degrees and inclination angle 100 or 80 degrees.\nThis model predicts that the slot gap emission below 200 MeV will exhibit\ncorrelations in time and phase with the radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2008 17:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These are independent of choices up to canonical isomorphism, and\nhave important invariance properties under Hamiltonian equivalence. Floer\ncohomology groups are the morphism groups in the derived Fukaya category of\n(M,w), and so are an essential part of the Homological Mirror Symmetry\nConjecture of Kontsevich.\n  The goal of this paper is to extend all this to immersed Lagrangians L in M\nwith immersion i : L --> M, with transverse self-intersections. In the embedded\ncase, Floer cohomology HF^*(L,b;\\Lambda) is a modified, 'quantized' version of\ncohomology H^*(L;\\Lambda) over the Novikov ring \\Lambda. In our immersed case,\nHF^*(L,b;\\Lambda) turns out to be a quantized version of the sum of\nH^*(L;\\Lambda) with a \\Lambda-module spanned by pairs (p,q) for p,q distinct\npoints of L with i(p)=i(q) in M.\n  The theory becomes simpler and more powerful for graded Lagrangians in\nCalabi-Yau manifolds, when we can work over a smaller Novikov ring\n\\Lambda_{CY}. The proofs involve associating a gapped filtered A-infinity\nalgebra over \\Lambda or \\Lambda_{CY} to i : L --> M, which is independent of\nnearly all choices up to canonical homotopy equivalence, and is built using a\nseries of finite approximations called A_{N,0} algebras for N=0,1,2,...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2008 17:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-21"}

A considerable fraction of the gamma-ray sources discovered with the\nEnergetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) remain unidentified.

Most of the variable sources\nare strong radio blazars.However, some low galactic-latitude EGRET sources,\nwith highly variable gamma-ray emission, lack any evident counterpart according\nto the radio data available until now.\n  Aims. The primary goal of this paper is to identify and characterise the\npotential radio counterparts of four highly variable gamma-ray sources in the\ngalactic plane through mapping the radio surroundings of the EGRET confidence\ncontours and determining the variable radio sources in the field whenever\npossible.\n  Methods. We have carried out a radio exploration of the fields of the\nselected EGRET sources using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)\ninterferometer at 21 cm wavelength, with pointings being separated by months.\n  Results.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the complexity of syndromeless decoding for RS codes, and compare\nit to that of syndrome-based decoding. Aiming to provide guidelines to\npractical applications, our complexity analysis differs in several aspects from\nexisting asymptotic complexity analysis, which is typically based on\nmultiplicative fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques and is usually in big O\nnotation. First, we focus on RS codes over characteristic-2 fields, over which\nsome multiplicative FFT techniques are not applicable. Secondly, due to\nmoderate block lengths of RS codes in practice, our analysis is complete since\nall terms in the complexities are accounted for. Finally, in addition to fast\nimplementation using additive FFT techniques, we also consider direct\nimplementation, which is still relevant for RS codes with moderate lengths.\nComparing the complexities of both syndromeless and syndrome-based decoding\nalgorithms based on direct and fast implementations, we show that syndromeless\ndecoding algorithms have higher complexities than syndrome-based ones for high\nrate RS codes regardless of the implementation.

The standard model predicts\nthat the electroweak interaction can produce a top quark together with an\nantibottom quark or light quark, without the antiparticle top quark partner\nthat is always produced from strong coupling processes. Top quarks were first\nobserved in pair production in 1995, and since then, single top quark\nproduction has been searched for in ever larger datasets. In this analysis, we\nselect events from a 0.9 fb-1 dataset that have an electron or muon and missing\ntransverse energy from the decay of a W boson from the top quark decay, and\ntwo, three, or four jets, with one or two of the jets identified as originating\nfrom a b hadron decay.

A binned likelihood fit of the\nsignal cross section plus background to the data from the combination of the\nresults from the three analysis methods gives a cross section for single top\nquark production of 4.7 +- 1.3 pb. The probability to measure a cross section\nat this value or higher in the absence of signal is 0.014%, corresponding to a\n3.6 standard deviation significance.

Translocation through each constituent part of the\ncomposite is treated as being analogous to the diffusion of the translocation\ncoordinate over the free energy landscape derived from the chain configurations\nwithin the pore. The proposed method accounts for possible reverse motions of\nthe leading chain end at the interface between constituent parts of a composite\npore, a possibility that has been neglected in prior studies. As an\nillustration of our method, we study the translocation of a Gaussian chain\nbetween two spherical compartments connected by a cylindrical pore, and by a\ncomposite pore consisting of two connected cylinders of different diameters,\nwhich is structurally similar to the $\\alpha$-hemolysin membrane channel. We\ndemonstrate that reverse chain motions between the pore constituents may\ncontribute significantly to the total translocation time. Our results further\nestablish that translocation through a two-cylinder composite pore is faster\nwhen the chain is introduced into the pore on the cis (wide) side of the\nchannel rather than the trans (narrow) side.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2008 22:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-07"}

Recently, it was shown in \\cite{I} that they admit left-right\nsymmetric characterizations analogue to those of Frobenius algebras: a\ncoalgebra $C$ is co-Frobenius if and only if it is isomorphic to its rational\ndual. We consider the more general quasi-co-Frobenius (QcF) coalgebras; in the\nfirst main result we show that these also admit symmetric characterizations: a\ncoalgebra is QcF if it is weakly isomorphic to its (left, or equivalently\nright) rational dual $Rat(C^*)$, in the sense that certain coproduct or product\npowers of these objects are isomorphic. These show that QcF coalgebras can be\nviewed as generalizations of both co-Frobenius coalgebras and Frobenius\nalgebras. Surprisingly, these turn out to have many applications to fundamental\nresults of Hopf algebras. The equivalent characterizations of Hopf algebras\nwith left (or right) nonzero integrals as left (or right) co-Frobenius, or QcF,\nor semiperfect or with nonzero rational dual all follow immediately from these\nresults. Also, the celebrated uniqueness of integrals follows at the same time\nas just another equivalent statement. Moreover, as a by-product of our methods,\nwe observe a short proof for the bijectivity of the antipode of a Hopf algebra\nwith nonzero integral. This gives a purely representation theoretic approach to\nmany of the basic fundamental results in the theory of Hopf algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2008 02:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 22:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-13"}

In many plasmas, long-lived metastable atomic levels are depopulated\nby collisions (quenched) before they decay radiatively. In low-density regions,\nhowever, the low collision rate may allow depopulation by electric dipole (E1)\nforbidden radiative transitions, so-called forbidden lines (mainly M1 and E2\ntransitions). If the atomic transition data are known, these lines are\nindicators of physical plasma conditions and used for abundance determination.\nAims. Transition rates can be derived by combining relative intensities between\nthe decay channels, so-called branching fractions (BFs), and the radiative\nlifetime of the common upper level. We use this approach for forbidden [Sc ii]\nlines, along with new calculations. Methods. Neither BFs for forbidden lines,\nnor lifetimes of metastable levels, are easily measured in a laboratory.\nTherefore, astrophysical BFs measured in Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph\n(STIS) spectra of the strontium filament of Eta Carinae are combined with\nlifetime measurements using a laser probing technique on a stored ion-beam\n(CRYRING facility,MSL, Stockholm).

We use the radial magnetic maps to extrapolate the\ncoronal field (by assuming a potential field) for each star individually - at\npresent ignoring any possible interaction. The secondary star is found to\nexhibit an extreme tilt (~75 deg) of its large scale magnetic field to that of\nits rotation axis for both epochs. The field complexity that is apparent in the\nsurface maps persists out to a significant fraction of the binary separation.\nAny interaction between the fields of the two stars is therefore likely to be\ncomplex also. Modelling this would require a full binary field extrapolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2008 11:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Its Z-dependence is\ndiscussed in relation to the formation of long-duration Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs)\nand the yields from early stellar generations. However, the mechanism of\nformation of WR-type stellar winds is still under debate. We present the first\nfully self-consistent atmosphere/wind models for late-type WN stars. We\ninvestigate the mechanisms leading to their strong mass loss, and examine the\ndependence on stellar parameters, in particular on the metallicity Z. We\nidentify WNL stars as very massive stars close to the Eddington limit,\npotentially still in the phase of central H-burning. Due to their high L/M\nratios, these stars develop optically thick, radiatively driven winds. These\nwinds show qualitatively different properties than the thin winds of OB stars.\nThe resultant mass loss depends strongly on Z, but also on the Eddington\nfactor, and the stellar temperature. We combine our results in a parametrized\nmass loss recipe for WNL stars. According to our present model computations,\nstars close to the Eddington limit tend to form strong WR-type winds, even at\nvery low Z. Our models thus predict an efficient mass loss mechanism for low\nmetallicity stars. For extremely metal-poor stars, we find that the\nself-enrichment with primary nitrogen can drive WR-type mass loss. These first\nWN stars might play an important role in the enrichment of the early ISM with\nfreshly produced nitrogen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2008 13:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Re-analysis\nof the enlarged data set of cluster Ap stars indicates that such stars with\nmasses in the range of 2 -- 5 \\mo show RMS fields larger than about 1 kG only\nwhen they are near the ZAMS. The time scale on which these large fields\ndisappear varies strongly with mass, ranging from about 250 Myr for stars of 2\n- 3 solar mass to 15 Myr for stars of 4 - 5 solar mass. Our data are consistent\neither with emergent flux conservation for most (but not all) Ap stars, or with\nmodest decline in flux with age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2008 14:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

At q=0 these formulas specialize to the\nformula of Schwer for the Macdonald spherical function in terms of positively\nfolded alcove walks and at q=t=0 these formulas specialize to the formula for\nthe Weyl character in terms of the Littelmann path model (in the positively\nfolded gallery form of Gaussent-Littelmann).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2008 18:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-10"}
