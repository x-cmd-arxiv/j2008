At the\nlevel of the chiral effective Lagrangian, discretization effects in the\nmixed-action theory give rise to two new parameters as compared to the lowest\norder Lagrangian for staggered fermions -- the residual quark mass, m_res, and\nthe mixed valence-sea meson mass-splitting, Delta_mix. We find that the size of\nm_res is approximately four times smaller than our lightest valence quark mass\non our coarser lattice spacing, and comparable to that of simulations by RBC\nand UKQCD. We also find that the size of Delta_mix is comparable to the\nsmallest of the staggered meson taste-splittings measured by MILC. Because\nlattice artifacts are different in the valence and sea sectors of the\nmixed-action theory, they give rise to unitarity-violating effects that\ndisappear in the continuum limit. Such effects are expected to be mild for many\nquantities of interest, but are significant in the case of the isovector scalar\n(a_0) correlator. Specifically, once m_res, Delta_mix, and two other parameters\nthat can be determined from the light pseudoscalar spectrum are known, the\ntwo-particle intermediate state \"bubble\" contribution to the scalar correlator\nis completely predicted within mixed-action chiral perturbation theory\n(MAChPT). We find that the behavior of the scalar meson correlator is\nquantitatively consistent with the MAChPT prediction; this supports the claim\nthat MAChPT describes the dominant unitarity-violating effects in the\nmixed-action theory and can be used to remove lattice artifacts and recover\nphysical quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Mar 2008 16:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The bare Raman intensity displays two peaks related\nto one-magnon van-Hove singularities. We find that 1/S self-energy corrections\nto the one-magnon spectrum strongly modify this intensity profile. The central\nRaman-peak is significantly enhanced due to plateaus in the magnon dispersion,\nthe high frequency peak is suppressed due to magnon damping, and the overall\nspectral support narrows considerably. Additionally we investigate final-state\ninteractions by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation to $O(1/S)$. In contrast to\ncollinear antiferromagnets, the non-collinear nature of the magnetic ground\nstate leads to an irreducible magnon scattering which is retarded and\nnon-separable already to lowest order.

We present a sample of 1716 galaxies with companions within Delta\nv < 500 km/s, r_p < 80 kpc and stellar mass ratio 0.1 < M_1/M_2 < 10 from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 4 (DR4). In agreement with\nprevious studies, we find an enhancement in the star formation rate (SFR) of\ngalaxy pairs at projected separations < 30--40 kpc. In addition, we find that\nthis enhancement is highest (and extends to the greatest separations) for\ngalaxies of approximately equal mass, the so-called `major' pairs. However, SFR\nenhancement can still be detected for a sample of galaxy pairs whose masses are\nwithin a factor of 10 of each other. In agreement with the one previous study\nof the luminosity-metallicity (LZ) relation in paired galaxies, we find an\noffset to lower metallicities (by ~ 0.1 dex) for a given luminosity for\ngalaxies in pairs compared to the control sample. We also present the first\nmass-metallicity (MZ) relation comparison between paired galaxies and the\nfield, and again find an offset to lower metallicities (by ~ 0.05 dex) for a\ngiven mass. The smaller offset in the MZ relation indicates that both higher\nluminosities and lower metallicities may contribute to the shift of pairs\nrelative to the control in the LZ relation. We show that the offset in the LZ\nrelation depends on galaxy half light radius, r_h. Galaxies with r_h < 3 kpc\nand with a close companion show a 0.05-0.1 dex downwards offset in metallicity\ncompared to control galaxies of the same size. Finally, we study the AGN\nfraction in both the pair and control sample and find that whilst selecting\ngalaxies in different cuts of color and asymmetry yields different AGN\nfractions, the fraction for pairs and the control sample are consistent for a\ngiven set of selection criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2008 01:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The model depends on\nthe parameters n, beta, and K, which represent, respectively, the number of\nspins, the inverse temperature, and the interaction strength. Our main focus is\non the asymptotic behavior of the magnetization m(beta_n,K_n) for appropriate\nsequences (beta_n,K_n) that converge to a second-order point or to the\ntricritical point of the model and that lie inside various subsets of the\nphase-coexistence region.

The suppression of back-to-back correlations\nin heavy-ion collisions allows, due to a different geometrical bias, a view\ninto the medium which is qualitatively different from the one offered by single\nhadron suppression. A control parameter for the suppression corresponding to a\nsystematic variation of in-medium pathlengths and density can be obtained by\nstudying collisions at finite impact parameter b. A systematic variation of\npathlength can then be introduced by studying the suppression pattern as a\nfunction of the angle phi with the reaction plane.

However, the analysis of greedy routing using the probability\ndistributions arising from these dynamics is quite complex because of mutual\ndependencies.

In the limit of zero crossing\nangle, the radiation tends towards a Cherenkov radiation with a discrete\nspectrum, studied by different authors. If the particle crosses a bent fiber at\nregularly spaced points, interference gives quasi-monochromatic lines. If the\nparticle passes near an end of the fiber, light is produced by the capture of\nvirtual photons through the end face. An alternative way consists in sticking a\nmetallic ball to the fiber: the passing particle induces plasmons which are\nthen evacuated as light in the fiber. Interferences can occur between lights\nfrom several ends or balls. Applications of these various light signals to beam\ndiagnostics are discussed. The shadow effect, which reduces the photon yield\nwhen the particle runs parallel to a row of balls, is pointed out and an upper\nbound $-dE/dz\\le C(Ze/b)^2$ for the particle energy loss is conjectured ($Ze$\nis the particle charge, $b$ the impact parameter and $C$ a numerical constant).\nThis bound should also apply to other kinds of light sources, in particular to\nSmith-Purcell radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2008 14:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

The mode sums are then explicitly calculated for the Schwinger model\nand SU(2) gauge theory in a homogeneous background field. Using SU(2) lattice\ngauge theory, the IR dominated mode sums are considered and the mode sum\napproximation to the static quark anti-quark potential is obtained numerically.\nWe find a good agreement between the mode sum approximation and the static\npotential at large distances for the confinement and the high temperature\nplasma phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2008 15:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 10:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A comparison between\nCahn's method and later works by Sullivan, Evans et al is made. By using an\nexpression of the energy of interaction between solid surface and liquids\nproposed recently by Gouin, we obtain the equations of density profiles and the\nboundary conditions on a solid surface. In the case of a convex free energy, a\none-dimensional solution of a linear problem is proposed for the density\nprofiles between a bulk and on a solid wall. A non-linear model of binary\nmixtures extending Cahn's results for simple fluids is also studied. For the\ncase of a purely attractive wall we have established a criterion of a first\norder transition in terms of the structure of the level set of the homogeneous\npart of the free energy. Additively, explicit expressions of density profiles\nnear the wall are proposed. They allow one to consider the adsorption of\nmixture components by a solid wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2008 13:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
