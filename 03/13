They found that at least half of these\nsources have signs of excess infrared emission. Here we discuss the nature of\nthe IR emission and its implications for cool core clusters. The strength of\nthe mid-IR excess emission correlates with the luminosity of the optical\nemission lines. Excluding the four systems dominated by an AGN, the excess\nmid-infrared emission in the remaining brightest cluster galaxies is likely\nrelated to star formation. The mass of molecular gas (estimated from CO\nobservations) is correlated with the IR luminosity as found for normal star\nforming galaxies. The gas depletion time scale is about 1 Gyr. The physical\nextent of the infrared excess is consistent with that of the optical emission\nline nebulae. This supports the hypothesis that the star formation occurs in\nmolecular gas associated with the emission line nebulae and with evidence that\nthe emission line nebulae are mainly powered by ongoing star formation. We find\na correlation between mass deposition rates (${\\dot M}_X$) estimated from the\nX-ray emission and the star formation rate estimated from the infrared\nluminosity. The star formation rates are 1/10 to 1/100 of the mass deposition\nrates suggesting that the re-heating of the ICM is generally very effective in\nreducing the amount of mass cooling from the hot phase but not eliminating it\ncompletely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2008 18:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Large-scale quantum communication (of\nthe order of 100 km) has been achieved; however, serious problems occur beyond\nthis distance scale, mainly due to inevitable photon loss in the transmission\nchannel. Quantum communication eventually fails when the probability of a dark\ncount in the photon detectors becomes comparable to the probability that a\nphoton is correctly detected. To overcome this problem, Briegel, D\\\"{u}r, Cirac\nand Zoller (BDCZ) introduced the concept of quantum repeaters, combining\nentanglement swapping and quantum memory to efficiently extend the achievable\ndistances. Although entanglement swapping has been experimentally demonstrated,\nthe implementation of BDCZ quantum repeaters has proved challenging owing to\nthe difficulty of integrating a quantum memory. Here we realize entanglement\nswapping with storage and retrieval of light, a building block of the BDCZ\nquantum repeater. We follow a scheme that incorporates the strategy of BDCZ\nwith atomic quantum memories. Two atomic ensembles, each originally entangled\nwith a single emitted photon, are projected into an entangled state by\nperforming a joint Bell state measurement on the two single photons after they\nhave passed through a 300-m fibre-based communication channel. The entanglement\nis stored in the atomic ensembles and later verified by converting the atomic\nexcitations into photons. Our method is intrinsically phase insensitive and\nestablishes the essential element needed to realize quantum repeaters with\nstationary atomic qubits as quantum memories and flying photonic qubits as\nquantum messengers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2008 16:40:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 10:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-01"}

We show that completing the precession\nequations with this term reveals the existence of a conserved quantity at 2PN\norder when averaging over orbital motion. This quantity allows one to solve the\n(orbit-averaged) precession equations exactly in the case of equal masses and\narbitrary spins, neglecting radiation reaction. For unequal masses, an exact\nsolution does not exist in closed form, but we are still able to derive\naccurate approximate analytic solutions. We also show how to incorporate\nradiation reaction effects into our analytic solutions adiabatically, and\ncompare the results to solutions obtained numerically. For various\nconfigurations of the binary, the relative difference in the accumulated\norbital phase computed using our analytic solutions versus a full numerical\nsolution vary from about 0.3% to 1.8% over the 80 - 140 orbital cycles\naccumulated while sweeping over the orbital frequency range 20 - 300 Hz.

We present the spectral, spatial, and\ntemporal properties of the bursts in the INTEGRAL GRB catalogue using data from\nthe imager, IBIS, and spectrometer, SPI. Spectral properties of the GRBs are\ndetermined using power-law, Band model and quasithermal model fits to the\nprompt emission. Spectral lags, i.e. the time delay in the arrival of\nlow-energy gamma-rays with respect to high-energy gamma-rays, are measured for\n31 of the GRBs. The photon index distribution of power-law fits to the prompt\nemission spectra is consistent with that obtained by Swift. The peak flux\ndistribution shows that INTEGRAL detects proportionally more weak GRBs than\nSwift because of its higher sensitivity in a smaller field of view. The all-sky\nrate of GRBs above ~0.15 ph cm^-2 s^-1 is ~1400 yr^-1 in the fully coded field\nof view of IBIS. Two groups are identified in the spectral lag distribution,\none with short lags <0.75 s (between 25-50 keV and 50-300 keV) and one with\nlong lags >0.75 s. Most of the long-lag GRBs are inferred to have low redshifts\nbecause of their long spectral lags, their tendency to have low peak energies\nand their faint optical and X-ray afterglows.

In this work we show that a combination of cavity effects and\nsurface plasmon generation gives rise to enhanced second harmonic generation in\nthe regime of extraordinary transmittance of the pump field. We have studied\nboth forward and backward second harmonic generation conversion efficiencies as\nfunctions of the geometrical parameters, and how they relate to pump\ntransmission efficiency. The resonance phenomenon is evident in the generated\nsecond harmonic signal, as conversion efficiency depends on the duration of\nincident pump pulse, and hence its bandwidth. Our results show that the\nexcitation of tightly confined modes as well as the combination of enhanced\ntransmission and nonlinear processes can lead to several potential new\napplications such as photo-lithography, scanning microscopy, and high-density\noptical data storage devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2008 20:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Tidal interactions produce well-defined spiral arms and\nextended tidal features such as bridge and tail that are all transient, but\ndistinct in nature. In the extended disks, strong tidal force is able to lock\nthe perturbed epicycle phases of the near-side particles to the perturber,\nshaping them into a tidal bridge that corotates with the perturber. A tidal\ntail develops at the opposite side as strongly-perturbed, near-side particles\novertake mildly-perturbed, far-side particles. The tail is essentially a narrow\nmaterial arm with a roughly logarithmic shape, dissolving with time because of\nlarge velocity dispersions. Inside the disks where tidal force is relatively\nweak, on the other hand, a two-armed logarithmic spiral pattern emerges due to\nthe kinematic alignment of perturbed particle orbits. While self-gravity makes\nthe spiral arms a bit stronger, the arms never become fully self-gravitating,\nwind up progressively with time, and decay after the peak almost exponentially\nin a time scale of ~ 1 Gyr. The arm pattern speed varying with both radius and\ntime converges to Omega-kappa/2 at late time, suggesting that the pattern speed\nof tidally-driven arms may depend on radius in real galaxies.

Variable selection for semiparametric regression\nmodels consists of two components: model selection for nonparametric components\nand selection of significant variables for the parametric portion. Thus,\nsemiparametric variable selection is much more challenging than parametric\nvariable selection (e.g., linear and generalized linear models) because\ntraditional variable selection procedures including stepwise regression and the\nbest subset selection now require separate model selection for the\nnonparametric components for each submodel. This leads to a very heavy\ncomputational burden. In this paper, we propose a class of variable selection\nprocedures for semiparametric regression models using nonconcave penalized\nlikelihood. We establish the rate of convergence of the resulting estimate.\nWith proper choices of penalty functions and regularization parameters, we show\nthe asymptotic normality of the resulting estimate and further demonstrate that\nthe proposed procedures perform as well as an oracle procedure. A\nsemiparametric generalized likelihood ratio test is proposed to select\nsignificant variables in the nonparametric component. We investigate the\nasymptotic behavior of the proposed test and demonstrate that its limiting null\ndistribution follows a chi-square distribution which is independent of the\nnuisance parameters. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to\nexamine the finite sample performance of the proposed variable selection\nprocedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2008 09:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

However, this is not the case for the\nconditional mass function (CMF). We propose a simple analytical procedure to\nderive the CMF by rescaling the UMF to the constrained environment using the\nappropriate mean and variance of the density field at the constrained point.\nThis method introduces two major modifications with respect to the standard\nre-scaling procedure. First of all, rather than using in the scaling procedure\nthe properties of the environment averaged over all the conditioning region, we\nimplement the re-scaling locally. We show that for high masses this\nmodification may lead to substantially different results. Secondly, we modify\nthe (local) standard re-scaling procedure in such a manner as to force\nnormalisation, in the sense that when one integrates the CMF over all possible\nvalues of the constraint multiplied by their corresponding probability\ndistribution, the UMF is recovered. In practise, we do this by replacing in the\nstandard procedure the value delta_c (the linear density contrast for collapse)\nby certain adjustable effective parameter delta_eff. In order to test the\nmethod, we compare our prescription with the results obtained from numerical\nsimulations in voids (Gottlober et al. 2003), finding a very good agreement.\nBased on these results, we finally present a very accurate analytical fit to\nthe (accumulated) conditional mass function obtained with our procedure, which\nmay be useful for any theoretical treatment of the large scale structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2008 12:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

After the above steps, an input solution\nbecomes partial and thus the resulting partial solution needs to be repaired.\nThe repair is carried out by using the Prioritization step to first produce\npriorities that determine an order by which the following Construction step\nthen schedules the remaining components. Therefore, the optimisation in the\nISWO is achieved by solution disruption, iterative improvement and an iterative\nconstructive repair process performed. Encouraging experimental results are\nreported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2008 15:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}

To achieve\nthis target, the Bayesian optimization algorithm builds a Bayesian network of\nthe joint probability distribution of the rules used to construct solutions,\nwhile the adapted classifier system assigns each rule a strength value that is\nconstantly updated according to its usefulness in the current situation.\nComputational results from 52 real data instances of nurse scheduling\ndemonstrate the success of both approaches. It is also suggested that the\nlearning mechanism in the proposed approaches might be suitable for other\nscheduling problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2008 15:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}
