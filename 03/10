Specifically, the frame\ndependence and stability properties of de Sitter space scalar field theory are\nstudied.

A key question is how\nsub-millisecond pulsars could form. Both sub-Keplerian (for neutron and quark\nstars) and super-Keplerian cases (only for quark stars, which are bound\nadditionally by strong interaction) have been discussed in this paper in order\nto investigate possible ways of forming sub-millisecond pulsars. In the\nsub-Keplerian case, the equilibrium periods of both neutron and quark stars\ncould be as low as ~0.4 ms when they are spun up through accretion in binary\nsystems. In the super-Keplerian case, pulsars could very likely have an initial\nperiod of ~0.1 ms if quark stars with different mass could be formed from\naccretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs. The timescale for a\nsub-millisecond pulsar to keep its period <1 ms is restricted due to\ngravitational wave radiation.

The\nimportance of Hume's Principle of Causality is stressed and his Principle of\nCausation is weakened. The key concept of the paper, the so-called relative\nfreedom, is also suggested by physics. It is a kind of freedom that can be\nobserved everywhere in nature. Turning to biology, incomplete knowledge is\ndefined for all organisms.

One source of their success is the relative freedom of choice\nfrom the basic option ranges: mutations, motions and neural connections.\nFinally, the conjecture is adopted that communicability can be used as a\ncriterion of consciousness and free will is defined as a conscious version of\nrelative freedom.

This\nmodel (MHB2000, Mathews et al. 2002) was adopted by the IAU (International\nAstronomical Union) during the General Assembly in Manchester, in 2000. It is\nbased (i) on some improvements for the precession model (with respect to the\nprevious one of Lieske et al. 1977) owing to the VLBI technique, and (ii) on a\nvery accurate nutation model, close to the observations. With this prize, the\nDescartes nutation project could offer for international scientists some\ngrants, to be used for further improvements of the precession-nutation Earth\nmodel. At the IGG (Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics), with the OCCAM 6.1\nVLBI analysis software and the best data and models available, we re-analyzed\nthe whole VLBI sessions available (from 1985 till 2005) solving for the Earth\nOrientation Parameters (EOP). In this paper we present the results obtained for\nthe EOP and more particularly for the nutation series. We compare them with the\nother IVS analysis centers results, as well as with the IVS combined EOP series\nfrom the analysis coordinator. The series are in good agreement, except for the\npolar motion coordinates that show a shift with respect to the other ones and\nthat we discuss here. Finally, we analyse the nutation series in the framework\nof the free core nutation (FCN) study and modelisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2008 12:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

We confront both conjectures with a\ndetailed analysis of the kinematical backreaction term and estimate its\nstrength for a multi-scale inhomogeneous matter and curvature distribution. Our\nmain result is a formula for the spatially averaged scalar curvature involving\nquantities that are all measurable on regional (i.e. up to 100 Mpc) scales.

A\nnonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in SNRs is employed to\ninvestigate the properties of Tycho's SNR and their correspondence to the\nexisting experimental data. It is demonstrated that the large mean ratio\nbetween the radii of the contact discontinuity and the forward shock is\nconsistent with the very effective acceleration of nuclear energetic particles\nat the forward shock.

The\ndata are analyzed by means of a code that simulates the emission of a nebula\nshowing a variety of physical conditions and kinematics.\n  Our observations clearly show that the CO emitting gas in Gomez's Hamburger\nforms a spectacular disk in keplerian rotation. Model calculations undoubtly\nconfirm this result. The central (mainly stellar) mass is found to be high, ~ 4\nMo for a distance of 500 pc. The mass and (relatively low) luminosity of the\nsource are, independent of the assumed distance, very different from those\npossible in evolved stars.

The distribution of absorbing column densities in type\nII QSOs is investigated and the dependence of absorption on X-ray luminosity\nand redshift is studied.\n  We inspected 51 spectroscopically classified type II QSO candidates from the\nXMM-Newton Marano field survey, the XMM-Newton-2dF wide angle survey (XWAS),\nand the AXIS survey to set-up a well-defined sample with secure optical type II\nidentifications. Fourteen type II QSOs were classified and an X-ray spectral\nanalysis performed. Since most of our sources have only ~40 X-ray counts\n(PN-detector), we carefully studied the fit results of the simulated X-ray\nspectra as a function of fit statistic and binning method. We determined that\nfitting the spectra with the Cash-statistic and a binning of minimum one count\nper bin recovers the input values of the simulated X-ray spectra best. Above\n100 PN counts, the free fits of the spectrum's slope and absorbing hydrogen\ncolumn density are reliable.\n  We find only moderate absorption (N_H=(2-10) x 10^22 cm^-2) and no obvious\ntrends with redshift and intrinsic X-ray luminosity. In a few cases a\nCompton-thick absorber cannot be excluded. Two type II objects with no X-ray\nabsorption were discovered. We find no evidence for an intrinsic separation\nbetween type II AGN and high X-ray luminosity type II QSO in terms of\nabsorption. The stacked X-ray spectrum of our 14 type II QSOs shows no iron\nK-alpha line. In contrast, the stack of the 8 type II AGN reveals a very\nprominent iron K-alpha line at an energy of ~ 6.6 keV and an EW ~ 2 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2008 15:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
