Namely, if the substance has mixed-valence ions, which\ncan supply free carriers and have electric dipole and spin moments, all three\ntypes of long-range order (ferromagnetic, ferroelectric and magnetoelectric\n(ME)) can occur at low temperature. The physical origin of the effect is that\ncharge carriers can mediate the multiferroic behavior via spin - spin (RKKY),\ndipole-dipole and dipole - spin interactions. Our estimate of the interaction\nmagnitude shows that there exist an optimal carrier concentration, at which the\nstrength of ME interaction is maximal and comparable to that of spin-spin RKKY\ninteraction. This permits to conclude that in substances, where RKKY\ninteraction between local spins is not small, a substantial value of free\ncarriers mediated ME interaction can occur. Our analysis shows that disorder in\nthe above substances does not suppress multiferroic effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Mar 2008 18:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We aim at evaluate robustly the evolution of\nrotating spirals since z~0.6, as well as to test the different schemes for\nclassifying galaxies morphologically. We used all the information provided by\nmulti-band images, color maps and 2 dimensional light fitting to assign to each\nobject a morphological class. We divided our sample between spiral disks,\npeculiar objects, compact objects and mergers. Using our morphological\nclassification scheme, 4/5 of identified spirals are rotating disks and more\nthan 4/5 of identified peculiar galaxies show complex kinematics, while\nautomatic classification methods such as Concentration-Asymmetry and GINI-M20\nseverely overestimate the fraction of relaxed disk galaxies. Using this\nmethodology, we find that the fraction of rotating spirals has increased by a\nfactor ~ 2 during the last 6 Gyrs, a much higher fraction that found previously\nbased on morphologies alone. These rotating spiral disks are forming stars very\nrapidly, doubling their stellar masses over the last 6 Gyrs, while most of\ntheir stars have been formed few Gyrs earlier, which reveals the presence of a\nlarge gas supply. Because they are likely the progenitors of local spirals, we\ncan conjecture how their properties are evolving. Their disks show some\nevidence for an inside-out growth and the gas supply/accretion is not made\nrandomly as the disk need to be stable in order to match the local disk\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Mar 2008 20:15:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2008 12:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

In this intermediate state, a\nnarrow spectral band of modes dominates the dynamics, giving rise to the\nformation of iso-surfaces of electric potential with a complicated topology.\nSince E x B advection of tracer particles takes place along these iso-surfaces,\ntheir topological complexity affects the characteristic features of radial and\npoloidal transport dramatically. In particular, they both become strongly\nnon-diffusive and non-Gaussian. Since radial transport determines the system\nconfinement properties and poloidal transport controls the equilibration\ndynamics (on any magnetic surface), the development of non-diffusive models in\nboth directions is thus of physical interest. In previous work, a fractional\nmodel to describe radial transport was constructed by the authors.

By using the Abel-Plana formula, the topological parts are\nexplicitly extracted from the vacuum expectation values. In this way the\nrenormalization is reduced to the renormalization procedure in uncompactified\nde Sitter spacetime. It is shown that in the uncompactified subspace the\nequation of state for the topological part of the energy-momentum tensor is of\nthe cosmological constant type. Asymptotic behavior of the topological parts in\nthe expectation values is investigated in the early and late stages of the\ncosmological expansion. In the limit when the comoving length of a compactified\ndimension is much smaller than the de Sitter curvature radius the topological\npart in the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor coincides with the\ncorresponding quantity for a massless field and is conformally related to the\ncorresponding flat spacetime result.

For instance, the nodes could correspond to neurons along the\ncortical surface and the vector field could correspond to the gradient of\nneurotrophic factors, or the nodes could represent towns while the vector\nfields would be given by economical and/or geographical gradients. Therefore\ntrajectory networks are natural models of a large number of geographical\nstructures. The geographical infiltrations correspond to the addition of new\nlocal connections between nearby existing nodes. As such, these infiltrations\ncould be related to several real-world processes such as contaminations,\ndiseases, attacks, parasites, etc. The way in which progressive geographical\ninfiltrations affect trajectory networks is investigated in terms of the\ndegree, clustering coefficient, size of the largest component and the lengths\nof the existing chains measured along the infiltrations. It is shown that the\nmaximum infiltration distance plays a critical role in the intensity of the\ninduced topological changes. For large enough values of this parameter, the\nchains intrinsic to the trajectory networks undergo a collapse which is shown\nnot to be related to the percolation of the network also implied by the\ninfiltrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2008 13:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2008 19:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-21"}

The dwarfs originally consist of a low surface brightness\nstellar disk embedded in a cosmologically motivated dark matter halo. During 10\nGyr of dynamical evolution and after 5 pericentre passages the dwarfs suffer\nsubstantial mass loss and their stellar component undergoes a major\nmorphological transformation from a disk to a bar and finally to a spheroid.\nThe bar is preserved for most of the time as the angular momentum is\ntransferred outside the galaxy. A dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy is formed via\ngradual shortening of the bar. This work thus provides a comprehensive\nquantitative explanation of a potentially crucial morphological transformation\nmechanism for dwarf galaxies that operates in groups as well as in clusters. We\ncompare three cases with different initial inclinations of the disk and find\nthat the evolution is fastest when the disk is coplanar with the orbit. Despite\nthe strong tidal perturbations and mass loss the dwarfs remain dark matter\ndominated. For most of the time the 1D stellar velocity dispersion, \\sigma,\nfollows the maximum circular velocity, V_{\\rm max}, and they are both good\ntracers of the bound mass.

The latter relation is\nbased on directly measuring the stellar kinematics of the simulated dwarf and\nmay thus be reliably used to map the observed stellar velocity dispersions of\ndSphs to halo circular velocities when addressing the missing satellites\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2008 15:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 13:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
