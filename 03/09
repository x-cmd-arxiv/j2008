How\nmuch of this dependence is a scaling violation has remained an intriguing\nquestion. Our approach has been to investigate the issue with an action with\nknown lattice artifacts, i.e., the standard Wilson quark and gauge action with\n$\\beta=5.6$ and 2 degenerate flavors of sea quarks on $ 16^3 \\times 32 $\nlattices. In order to study in detail the sea quark mass dependence,\nmeasurements are carried out at eight values of the Wilson hopping parameter\n$\\kappa$ in the range 0.156 - 0.158 corresponding to PCAC quark mass values\n$am_q$ from about 0.07 to below 0.015. We analyze the static potential by\nfitting to the familiar phenomenological form and extract $a/r_c$.

Indeed, merely a single case of a star-planet-disk\nsystem has previously been detected at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths.\nConsequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poor\nstatistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or the\nphysics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias and\nselection effects. Finding more examples would be very significant. The\nselected target, q1 Eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess a\nplanet, q1 Eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at IRAS wavelengths, but had\nremained undetected in the millimeter regime. Therefore, submm flux densities\nwould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of the\nplanetary disk. Consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1\nEri. The detected dust toward q1 Eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable fact\nthat the entire SED, from the IR to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a single\ntemperature blackbody function (60 K). This would imply that the emitting\nregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much larger\nthan the orbital distance of q1 Eri b, and that the emitting particles are\nconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. However, the 870 micron source is\nextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 AU. Therefore, a\nphysically more compelling model also invokes a belt of cold dust (17 K),\nlocated at 300 AU from the star and about 60 AU wide. The minimum mass of 0.04\nMearth (3 Mmoon) of 1 mm-size icy ring-particles is considerable, given the\nstellar age of about 1 Gyr. These big grains form an inner edge at about 25 AU,\nwhich may suggest the presence of an unseen outer planet (q1 Eri c).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Mar 2008 13:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
