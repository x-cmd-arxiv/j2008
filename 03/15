Application scenarios of probabilistic databases\nhowever often involve the conditioning of a database using additional\ninformation in the form of new evidence. The conditioning problem is thus to\ntransform a probabilistic database of priors into a posterior probabilistic\ndatabase which is materialized for subsequent query processing or further\nrefinement. It turns out that the conditioning problem is closely related to\nthe problem of computing exact tuple confidence values.\n  It is known that exact confidence computation is an NP-hard problem. This has\nled researchers to consider approximation techniques for confidence\ncomputation. However, neither conditioning nor exact confidence computation can\nbe solved using such techniques.\n  In this paper we present efficient techniques for both problems.

We find that these formation times have different dependence on halo\nmass. While some formation times characterize well the hierarchical nature of\nhalo formation, in the sense that more massive halos have later formation, the\ntrend is reversed for other definitions of the formation time. In particular,\nthe formation times that are likely to be related to the formation of galaxies\nin dark halos show strong trends of ``down-sizing'', in that lower-mass halos\nform later. We also investigate how the correlation amplitude of dark matter\nhalos depends on the different formation times.

In the model, two distinct accretion\nmodes depending on gravitational stability of the CND play a key role on\naccreting gas to a SMBH. (i) If the CMD is gravitationally unstable, energy\nfeedback from supernovae (SNe) supports a geometrically thick, turbulent gas\ndisk. The accretion in this mode is dominated by turbulent viscosity, and it is\nsignificantly larger than that in the mode (ii), i.e., the CMD is supported by\ngas pressure. Once the gas supply from the host is stopped, the high accretion\nphase ($\\sim 0.01- 0.1 M_{\\odot} {\\rm yr}^{-1}$) changes to the low one (mode\n(ii), $\\sim 10^{-4} M_{\\odot} {\\rm yr}^{-1}$), but there is a delay with $\\sim\n10^{8}$ yr. Through this evolution, the gas-rich CND turns into the gas poor\nstellar disk. We found that not all the gas supplied from the host galaxy\naccrete onto the SMBH even in the high accretion phase (mode (i)), because the\npart of gas is used to form stars. As a result, the final SMBH mass ($M_{\\rm\nBH,final}$) is not proportional to the total gas mass supplied from the host\ngalaxy ($M_{\\rm sup}$); $M_{\\rm BH,final}/M_{\\rm sup}$ decreases with $M_{\\rm\nsup}$.This would indicate that it is difficult to form a SMBH with $\\sim 10^{9}\nM_{\\odot}$ observed at high-$z$ QSOs. The evolution of the SMBH and CND would\nbe related to the evolutionary tracks of different type of AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Mar 2008 06:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Analytical expressions are derived\nfor each perturbative field, and basic properties are analyzed. The power\nspectrum of the fields is well approximated by a power-law, resulting in\nsignificant tails at high frequencies. Another feature of the perturbation by a\nsubstructure is that the ratio of the power spectrum at order $n$ of the 2\nfields $R_n$ is nearly 1. The ratio $R_n \\simeq 1$ is specific to\nsubstructures, for instance an higher order distortion ($n>2$) but with\nauto-similar isophotes will result in $R_n \\propto \\frac{1}{n^2}$. Finally, the\nproblem of reconstructing the perturbative field is investigated. Local field\nmodel are implemented and fitted to maximize image similarity in the source\nplane. The non-linear optimization is greatly facilitated, since in the\nperturbative approach the circular source solution is always known. Examples of\nimages distortions in the subcritical regime due to substructures are\npresented, and analyzed for different source shapes. Provided enough images and\nsignal is available, the substructure field can be identified confidently.\nThese results suggests that the perturbative method is an efficient tool to\nestimate the contribution of substructures to the mass distribution of lenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Mar 2008 13:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
