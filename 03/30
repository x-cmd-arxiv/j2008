For cases in which there is an angular dependence in the relation\namong intensity, flavor and spectrum, we find instabilities in the evolution\nequations and greatly speeded-up flavor exchange. The instabilities are\ncategorized by examining linear perturbations to simple solutions, and their\neffects are exhibited in complete numerical solutions to the system. The\napplication is to the region just under the neutrino surfaces in the supernova\ncore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2008 13:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-29"}

This is illustrated in terms of computation using\nHeisenberg interactions only, where global decoupling pulses commute with the\ncomputation. We derive a rigorous error bound on the trace distance or fidelity\nbetween the desired computational state and the actual time-evolved state, for\na system subject to coupling to a bounded-strength bath. The bound is expressed\nin terms of the operator norm of the effective Hamiltonian generating the\nevolution in the presence of decoupling and logic operations. We apply the\nbound to the case of periodic pulse sequences and find that in order maintain a\nconstant trace distance or fidelity, the number of cycles -- at fixed pulse\ninterval and width -- scales in inverse proportion to the square of the number\nof qubits. This sets a scalability limit on the protection of quantum\ncomputation using periodic dynamical decoupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2008 14:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-14"}
