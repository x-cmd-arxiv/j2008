These properties\nsimultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and the cluster\nobservable-mass relation. It was recently discovered that the clustering\namplitude of halos depends not only on the halo mass, but also on various\nsecondary variables, such as the halo formation time and the concentration;\nthese dependences are collectively termed assembly bias. Applying modified\nFisher matrix formalism, we explore whether these secondary variables have a\nsignificant impact on the study of dark energy properties using the\nself-calibration technique in current (SDSS) and the near future (DES, SPT, and\nLSST) cluster surveys. The impact of the secondary dependence is determined by\n(1) the scatter in the observable-mass relation and (2) the correlation between\nobservable and secondary variables. We find that for optical surveys, the\nsecondary dependence does not significantly influence an SDSS-like survey;\nhowever, it may affect a DES-like survey (given the high scatter currently\nexpected from optical clusters) and an LSST-like survey (even for low scatter\nvalues and low correlations). For an SZ survey such as SPT, the impact of\nsecondary dependence is insignificant if the scatter is 20% or lower but can be\nenhanced by the potential high scatter values introduced by a highly correlated\nbackground. Accurate modeling of the assembly bias is necessary for cluster\nself-calibration in the era of precision cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2008 19:16:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2008 23:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Moreover, with regards to the AdS/CFT correspondence the result is\nincomplete as the fluctuations orthogonal to this subspace in AdS_5 x S^5 are\nnot taken into account. Nevertheless, the calculation serves the purpose of\nunderstanding how the moduli of the algebraic curve gets quantised\nsemiclassically, purely from the point of view of finite-gap integration and\nwith no input from the gauge theory side. Our result is expressed in a very\ncompact and simple formula which encodes the infinite sum over stability angles\nin a succinct way and reproduces exactly what one expects from knowledge of the\ndual gauge theory. Namely, at tree level the filling fractions of the algebraic\ncurve get quantised in large integer multiples of hbar = 1/lambda^{1/2}. At\n1-loop order the filling fractions receive Maslov index corrections of hbar/2\nand all the singular points of the spectral curve become filled with small\nhalf-integer multiples of hbar.

With Dirichlet Process priors and an\nefficient implementation the models are highly scalable, as demonstrated with a\nsocial network from the Last.fm web site, with 670,000 nodes and 1.89 million\nlinks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2008 18:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-12"}

Membership of 37 objects can be confirmed\nthrough new radial velocities and data collected from the literature. The\nresulting colour-magnitude diagram shows that early-type FS90 galaxies that are\nspectroscopically confirmed Antlia members or that were considered as definite\nmembers by FS90, follow a well defined CMR (sigma_(C -T1) ~ 0.07 mag) that\nspans 9 magnitudes in brightness with no apparent change of slope. This\nrelation is very tight for the whole magnitude range but S0 galaxies show a\nlarger dispersion, apparently due to a separation of ellipticals and S0s.\nAntlia displays a slope of -13.6 in a T1 vs. (C -T1) diagram, in agreement with\nresults for clusters like Fornax, Virgo, Perseus and Coma, which are\ndynamically different to Antlia. This fact might indicate that the build up of\nthe CMR in cluster of galaxies is more related to galaxies internal processes\nthan to the influence of the environment. Interpreting the CMR as a\nluminosity-metallicity relation of old stellar systems, the metallicities of\nthe Antlia galaxies define a global relation down to Mv ~ -13. We also find,\nfor early-type dwarfs, no clear relation between luminosity and effective\nradius, indicating a nearly constant mean effective radius of ~ 1 kpc. This\nvalue is also found in several samples of dwarf galaxies in Virgo and Coma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2008 17:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-19"}

The bulk of the observations (135h) were obtained during a WET\ncampaign (XCOV15) in July 1997 that featured coordinated observing from 4\nsouthern observatory sites over an 8-day period. The remaining data (42h) were\nobtained in June 2004 at Mt John Observatory in NZ over a one-week observing\nperiod. This work significantly extends the discovery observations of this\nlow-amplitude (few percent) pulsator by increasing the number of detected\nfrequencies from 8 to 18, and employs a simulation procedure to confirm the\nreality of these frequencies to a high level of significance (1 in 1000). The\nnature of the observed pulsation spectrum precludes identification of unique\npulsation mode properties using any clearly discernable trends. However, we\nhave used a global modelling procedure employing genetic algorithm techniques\nto identify the n, l values of 8 pulsation modes, and thereby obtain\nasteroseismic measurements of several model parameters, including the stellar\nmass (0.55 M_sun) and T_eff (~28200 K). These values are consistent with those\nderived from published spectral fitting: T_eff ~ 28400 K and log g ~ 7.86. We\nalso present persuasive evidence from apparent rotational mode splitting for\ntwo of the modes that indicates this compact object is a relatively rapid\nrotator with a period of 2h. In direct analogy with the corresponding\nproperties of the hydrogen (DAV) atmosphere pulsators, the stable low-amplitude\npulsation behaviour of EC 20058 is entirely consistent with its inferred\neffective temperature, which indicates it is close to the blue edge of the DBV\ninstability strip.

The\nsubstructural logic usually associated with K is an algebraizable logic that\nhas K as its equivalent algebraic semantics, and is a logic that preserves\ntruth, i.e., 1 is the only truth value preserved by the inferences of the\nlogic. In this paper we introduce another logic associated with K, namely the\nlogic that preserves degrees of truth, in the sense that it preserves lower\nbounds of truth values in inferences. We study this second logic mainly from\nthe point of view of abstract algebraic logic. We determine its algebraic\nmodels and we classify it in the Leibniz and the Frege hierarchies: we show\nthat it is always fully selfextensional, that for most varieties K it is\nnon-protoalgebraic, and that it is algebraizable if and only K is a variety of\ngeneralized Heyting algebras, in which case it coincides with the logic that\npreserves truth. We also characterize the new logic in three ways: by a Hilbert\nstyle axiomatic system, by a Gentzen style sequent calculus, and by a set of\nconditions on its closure operator. Concerning the relation between the two\nlogics, we prove that the truth preserving logic is the purely inferential\nextension of the one that preserves degrees of truth with either the rule of\nModus Ponens or the rule of Adjunction for the fusion connective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2008 18:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2009 15:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-02"}

The Zel'dovich mechanism for\nDDT requires the formation of a nearly isothermal region of mixed ash and fuel\nthat is larger than a critical size. We primarily consider the hypothesis by\nKhokhlov et al. and Niemeyer and Woosley that the nearly isothermal, mixed\nregion is produced when the flame makes the transition to the distributed\nregime. We use two models for the distribution of the turbulent velocity\nfluctuations to estimate the probability as a function of the density in the\nexploding white dwarf that a given region of critical size is in the\ndistributed regime due to strong local turbulent stretching of the flame\nstructure. We also estimate lower limits on the number of such regions as a\nfunction of density. We find that the distributed regime, and hence perhaps\nDDT, occurs in a local region of critical size at a density at least a factor\nof 2-3 larger than predicted for mean conditions that neglect intermittency.\nThis factor brings the transition density to be much larger than the empirical\nvalue from observations in most situations. We also consider the intermittency\neffect on the more stringent conditions for DDT by Lisewski et al. and Woosley.\nWe find that a turbulent velocity of $10^8$ cm/s in a region of size $10^6$ cm,\nrequired by Lisewski et al., is rare. We expect that intermittency gives a\nweaker effect on the Woosley model with stronger criterion. The predicted\ntransition density from this criterion remains below $10^7$ g/cm$^3$ after\naccounting for intermittency using our intermittency models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2008 01:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

All the other axioms of ZF are valid and all the basic sets, such as\ncomplement, intersection and cartesian product, exist although complement is\nnot quite the same set as in ZF. The set of all sets can be equipped with the\ntopology of approximations (Ta). Every set is closed and every function is\ncontinuous in Ta. This implies that the Continuum Hypothesis is false. The sets\ncontaining a subset which is perfect in Ta are of the greatest cardinality. A\nsimple observation shows that the concept of well-ordering must be defined in a\nslightly different way than in ZF. We prove that a set can be well-ordered if\nand only if it has no perfect subset. Therefore the cardinalities of arbitrary\nsets are always comparable without assuming the Axiom of Choice.

Methods: Using traditional Fourier analysis\ntechniques on three independent data reductions, intrinsic frequencies for the\nstar are identified. Theoretical non-adiabatic axisymmetric modes influenced by\na magnetic field having polar field strengths Bp = 0-5kG were computed to\ncompare the observations to theory. Results: The high-precision data allow us\nto identify three definite intrinsic pulsation frequencies and two other\ncandidate frequencies with low S/N.

Recent work has shown that primordial gas that is not collapsing\ngravitationally but is cooling from an initially ionized state forms hydrogen\ndeuteride, HD, in sufficient amounts to cool the gas to the temperature of the\ncosmic microwave background. This extra cooling can reduce the characteristic\nmass for gravitational fragmentation and may cause a shift in the\ncharacteristic masses of population III stars. Motivated by the importance of\nthe atomic and molecular data for the cosmological question, we assess several\nchemical and radiative processes that have hitherto been neglected: the\nsensitivity of the low temperature H2 cooling rate to the ratio of ortho-H2 to\npara-H2, the uncertainty in the low temperature cooling rate of H2 excited by\ncollisions with H, the effects of cooling from H2 excited by collisions with H+\nand e-, and the large uncertainties in the rates of several of the reactions\nresponsible for determining the H2 fraction in the gas.\n  We show that the most important of the neglected processes is the excitation\nof H2 by collisions with protons and electrons. This cools the gas more rapidly\nat early times, and so it forms less H2 and HD at late times. This fact, as\nwell as several of the chemical uncertainties presented here, significantly\naffects the thermal evolution of the gas. We anticipate that this may lead to\nclear differences in future detailed 3D studies of first structure formation.\nFinally, we show that although the thermal evolution of the gas is in principle\nsensitive to the ortho-para ratio, in practice the standard assumption of a 3:1\nratio produces results that are almost indistinguishable from those produced by\na more detailed treatment.

We\nfocus on the regime where the initial inter-atomic interactions dominate over\nthe kinetic energy and the disorder. At equilibrium in a trapping potential and\nfor small disorder, the condensate shows a Thomas-Fermi shape modified by the\ndisorder. When the condensate is released from the trap, a strong suppression\nof the expansion is obtained in contrast to the situation in a periodic\npotential with similar characteristics. This effect crucially depends on both\nthe momentum distribution of the expanding BEC and the strength of the\ndisorder. For strong disorder, the suppression of the expansion results from\nthe fragmentation of the core of the condensate and from classical reflections\nfrom large modulations of the disordered potential in the tails of the\ncondensate. We identify the corresponding disorder-induced trapping scenario\nfor which large atom-atom interactions and strong reflections from single\nmodulations of the disordered potential play central roles. For weak disorder,\nthe suppression of the expansion signals the onset of Anderson localization,\nwhich is due to multiple scattering from the modulations of the disordered\npotential.

By writing the flow of\nray trajectories in terms of linear phase space operators, it is suggested here\nto reformulate ray-tracing algorithms in terms of boundary operators containing\nonly short ray segments. SEA can now be identified as a low resolution ray\ntracing algorithm and typical SEA assumptions can be quantified in terms of the\nproperties of the ray dynamics. The new technique presented here enhances the\nrange of applicability of standard SEA considerably by systematically\nincorporating dynamical correlations wherever necessary. Some of the\ninefficiencies inherent in typical ray tracing methods can be avoided using\nonly a limited amount of the geometrical ray information. The new dynamical\ntheory - Dynamical Energy Analysis (DEA) - thus provides a universal approach\ntowards determining wave energy distributions in complex structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2008 14:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
