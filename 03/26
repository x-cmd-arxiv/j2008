Common security protocols for aggregated WSNs are\neither hop-by-hop or end-to-end, each of which has its own encryption schemes\nconsidering different security primitives. End-to-end encrypted data\naggregation protocols introduce maximum data secrecy with in-efficient data\naggregation and more vulnerability to active attacks, while hop-by-hop data\naggregation protocols introduce maximum data integrity with efficient data\naggregation and more vulnerability to passive attacks.\n  In this paper, we propose a secure aggregation protocol for aggregated WSNs\ndeployed in hostile environments in which dual attack modes are present. Our\nproposed protocol is a blend of flexible data aggregation as in hop-by-hop\nprotocols and optimal data confidentiality as in end-to-end protocols. Our\nprotocol introduces an efficient O(1) heuristic for checking data integrity\nalong with cost-effective heuristic-based divide and conquer attestation\nprocess which is $O(\\ln{n})$ in average -O(n) in the worst scenario- for\nfurther verification of aggregated results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2008 18:08:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Is individual cell motion best characterized as a random\nwalk? Do individual cells have a search strategy when they are beyond the range\nof the signal they would otherwise move toward? Here we ask if single,\nisolated, Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium amoebae bias their motion in the\nabsence of external cues. We placed single well-isolated Dictyostelium and\nPolysphondylium cells on a nutrient-free agar surface and followed them at 10\nsec intervals for ~10 hr, then analyzed their motion with respect to velocity,\nturning angle, persistence length, and persistence time, comparing the results\nto the expectation for a variety of different types of random motion. We find\nthat amoeboid behavior is well described by a special kind of random motion:\nAmoebae show a long persistence time (~10 min) beyond which they start to lose\ntheir direction; they move forward in a zig-zag manner; and they make turns\nevery 1-2 min on average. They bias their motion by remembering the last turn\nand turning away from it. Interpreting the motion as consisting of runs and\nturns, the duration of a run and the amplitude of a turn are both found to be\nexponentially distributed.

It does not support the\nspin-Peierls phase, which is predicted as an additional possibility within\nLandau theory, and the transition is first-order for reasons unconnected with\nthe symmetry analysis of Landau theory. Quenched disorder stabilises the cubic\nphase, and we find a phase diagram as a function of temperature and disorder\nstrength similar to that observed in ZnCdCrO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2008 17:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 09:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-30"}

From the small\nangular distance of the clouds to group members, and the small velocity\ndifference between group members and clouds, we conclude that the clouds are\nmost likely relics of ongoing interactions between galaxies in the group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2008 20:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, such algorithms run on planar graphs only. To efficiently\nconstruct a planar graph, they require a unit-disk graph. To make the topology\nunit-disk, the maximum link length in the network has to be selected\nconservatively. In practical setting this leads to the designs where the node\ndensity is rather high. Moreover, the network diameter of a planar subgraph is\ngreater than the original graph, which leads to longer routes. To remedy this\nproblem, we propose a void traversal algorithm that works on arbitrary\ngeometric graphs. We describe how to use this algorithm for geometric routing\nwith guaranteed delivery and compare its performance with GFG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2008 20:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

A new method is\nintroduced to analyze low resolution (~5 AE) spectra, which yields\nmetallicities accurate to 0.2 dex including the uncertainties arising from the\nerrors in Teff (5%) and log g (0.2 dex). For the first time the stellar\nmetallicity gradient based on elements such as titanium and iron in a galaxy\nbeyond the Local Group is investigated. Solar metallicity is measured in the\ncenter and 0.3 solar in the outskirts and a logarithmic gradient of -0.08\ndex/kpc. An average reddening of E(B-V)~0.12 mag is obtained, however with a\nlarge variation from 0.07 to 0.24 mag. We also determine stellar radii,\nluminosities and masses and discuss the evolutionary status. Finally, the\nobserved relationship between absolute bolometric magnitudes M_{bol} and flux\nweighted gravities g_{F} = g/Teff^4 is investigated. At high temperatures the\nstrengths of the Balmer lines depends solely on the flux-weighted gravity,\nwhich allows a precise direct determination of log g_{F} with an accuracy of\n0.05 to 0.1 dex. We find a tight relationship between M_{bol} and log g_{F} in\nagreement with stellar evolution theory. Combining these new results with\nprevious work on Local Group galaxies we obtain a new flux weighted gravity\nluminosity relationship (FGLR), which is very well defined and appears to be an\nexcellent alternative tool to determine distances to galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 01:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However,\nthe standard SVM can not select variables automatically and therefore its\nsolution typically utilizes all the input variables without discrimination.\nThis makes it difficult to identify important predictor variables, which is\noften one of the primary goals in data analysis. In this paper, we propose two\nnovel types of regularization in the context of the multicategory SVM (MSVM)\nfor simultaneous classification and variable selection. The MSVM generally\nrequires estimation of multiple discriminating functions and applies the argmax\nrule for prediction. For each individual variable, we propose to characterize\nits importance by the supnorm of its coefficient vector associated with\ndifferent functions, and then minimize the MSVM hinge loss function subject to\na penalty on the sum of supnorms. To further improve the supnorm penalty, we\npropose the adaptive regularization, which allows different weights imposed on\ndifferent variables according to their relative importance. Both types of\nregularization automate variable selection in the process of building\nclassifiers, and lead to sparse multi-classifiers with enhanced\ninterpretability and improved accuracy, especially for high dimensional low\nsample size data. One big advantage of the supnorm penalty is its easy\nimplementation via standard linear programming. Several simulated examples and\none real gene data analysis demonstrate the outstanding performance of the\nadaptive supnorm penalty in various data settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 08:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Minimal perfect hashing makes it\npossible to avoid storing the set S, but this induces a space overhead of\nTheta(n) bits in addition to the nr bits needed for function values. In this\npaper we show how to eliminate this overhead. Moreover, we show that for any k\nquery time O(k) can be achieved using space that is within a factor 1+e^{-k} of\noptimal, asymptotically for large n. If we allow logarithmic evaluation time,\nthe additive overhead can be reduced to O(log log n) bits whp. The time to\nconstruct the data structure is O(n), expected. A main technical ingredient is\nto utilize existing tight bounds on the probability of almost square random\nmatrices with rows of low weight to have full row rank. In addition to direct\nconstructions, we point out a close connection between retrieval structures and\nhash tables where keys are stored in an array and some kind of probing scheme\nis used. Further, we propose a general reduction that transfers the results on\nretrieval into analogous results on approximate membership, a problem\ntraditionally addressed using Bloom filters. Again, we show how to eliminate\nthe space overhead present in previously known methods, and get arbitrarily\nclose to the lower bound. The evaluation procedures of our data structures are\nextremely simple (similar to a Bloom filter). For the results stated above we\nassume free access to fully random hash functions. However, we show how to\njustify this assumption using extra space o(n) to simulate full randomness on a\nRAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 10:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-27"}

It is natural to statistically model this as a\nbinomial-variable proportion, with a given (observed) number of qualifying\nattempts (called ``at-bats''), an observed number of successes (``hits'')\ndistributed according to the binomial distribution, and with a true (but\nunknown) value of $p_i$ that represents the player's latent ability. This is a\ncommon data structure in many statistical applications; and so the\nmethodological study here has implications for such a range of applications. We\nlook at batting records for each Major League player over the course of a\nsingle season (2005). The primary focus is on using only the batting records\nfrom an earlier part of the season (e.g., the first 3 months) in order to\nestimate the batter's latent ability, $p_i$, and consequently, also to predict\ntheir batting-average performance for the remainder of the season. Since we are\nusing a season that has already concluded, we can then validate our estimation\nperformance by comparing the estimated values to the actual values for the\nremainder of the season. The prediction methods to be investigated are\nmotivated from empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes interpretations. A newly\nproposed nonparametric empirical Bayes procedure performs particularly well in\nthe basic analysis of the full data set, though less well with analyses\ninvolving more homogeneous subsets of the data. In those more homogeneous\nsituations better performance is obtained from appropriate versions of more\nfamiliar methods. In all situations the poorest performing choice is the\nna\\\"{{\\i}}ve predictor which directly uses the current average to predict the\nfuture average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 11:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

One\nis the \\mu-/B \\mu-problem and the second is the cosmological one. The former\nstems from the fact that the B parameter tends to be comparable with the\ngravitino mass, which is two order of magnitude larger than the other soft\nmasses. The latter problem is caused by the decay of the modulus whose\nbranching ratio into the gravitino pair is sizable. In this paper, we propose a\nmodel of mirage mediation, in which Peccei-Quinn symmetry is incorporated. In\nthis axionic mirage mediation, it is shown that the PQ symmetry breaking scale\nis dynamically determined around 10^{10-12} GeV due to the supersymmetry\nbreaking effects, and the \\mu-problem can be solved naturally. Furthermore, in\nour model, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is the axino, that is the\nsuperpartner of the axion. The overabundance of the LSPs due to decays of\nmodulus/gravitino, which is the most serious cosmological difficulty in the\nmirage mediation, can be avoided if the axino is sufficiently light. The\nnext-LSPs (NLSPs) produced by the gravitino decay eventually decay into the\naxino LSPs, yielding the dominant component of the axinos remaining today. It\nis shown that the axino with the mass of O(100) MeV is naturally realized,\nwhich can constitute the dark matter of the Universe, with the free-streaming\nlength of the order of 0.1 Mpc. The saxion, the real scalar component of the\naxion supermultiplet, can also be cosmologically harmless due to the dilution\nof the modulus decay. The lifetime of NLSP is relatively long, but much shorter\nthan 1 sec., when the big-bang nucleosynthesis commences. The decay of NLSP\nwould provide intriguing collider signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 13:18:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2008 09:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This is due to a structural transition of the\ncorresponding gradient network clusters, which self-organize such as to reduce\nthe congestion pressure. This reduction is enhanced when lowering the value of\nthe connectivity exponent $\\lambda$ towards 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 15:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-27"}
