The resulting effective pair\ninteractions between a nanoparticle and a point particle, as well as between\ntwo nanoparticles, are then given by spherically symmetric potentials. If\noverlap between particles is allowed, the effective potential generally has\nnon-analytic points, but for each effective potential the expressions for\ndifferent overlapping cases can be written in terms of one analytic auxiliary\npotential. Effective potentials for hollow nanoparticles (appropriate e.g. for\nbuckyballs) are also considered, and shown to be related to those for solid\nnanoparticles. Finally, explicit expressions are given for the effective\npotentials derived from basic pair potentials of power law and exponential\nform, as well as from the commonly used London-Van der Waals, Morse,\nBuckingham, and Lennard-Jones potential. The applicability of the latter is\ndemonstrated by comparison with an atomic description of nanoparticles with an\ninternal face centered cubic structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2008 19:26:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2008 21:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The feedback model we consider\nconsists of two distinct phases: 1) an early starburst during the bulge\nformation and 2) a subsequent long-lasting mass and energy injection from\nstellar winds of low-mass stars and Type Ia SNe. An energetic outward blastwave\nis initiated by the starburst and is maintained and enhanced by the\nlong-lasting stellar feedback. For a MW-like galactic bulge, this blastwave\nsweeps up the halo gas in the proto-galaxy and heats up the surrounding medium\nto a scale much beyond the virial radius of the halo, thus the accretion of the\nhalo hot gas can be completely stopped. In addition, the long-lasting feedback\nin the later phase powers a galactic bulge wind that is reverse-shocked at a\nlarge radius in the presence of surrounding intergalactic medium and hence\nmaintains a hot gaseous halo. As the mass and energy injection decreases with\ntime, the feedback evolves to a subsonic and quasi-stable outflow, which is\nenough to prevent halo gas from cooling. The two phases of the feedback thus\nre-enforce each-other's impact on the gas dynamics. The simulation results\ndemonstrate that the stellar bulge feedback may provide a plausible solution to\nthe long-standing problems in understanding the MW type galaxies, such as the\n\"missing stellar feedback\" problem and the \"over-cooling\" problem. The\nsimulations also show that the properties of the hot gas in the subsonic\noutflow state depend sensitively on the environment and the formation history\nof the bulge. This dependence and variance may explain the large dispersion in\nthe X-ray to B-band luminosity ratio of the low $L_X/L_B$ Es.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2008 21:41:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2008 15:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

This system contains a striking\nexample of `beads on a string': a series of star formation complexes ~1 kpc\napart. These `beads' are found in a tail-like feature that is perpendicular to\nthe disk of NGC 2856, which implies that it was formed from material accreted\nfrom the companion NGC 2854. The extreme blueness of the optical/UV colors and\nredness of the mid-infrared colors implies very young stellar ages (~4 - 20\nMyrs) for these star forming regions. Spectral decomposition of these `beads'\nshows excess emission above the modeled stellar continuum in the 3.6 micron and\n4.5 micron bands, indicating either contributions from interstellar matter to\nthese fluxes or a second older stellar population. These clumps have -12.0 <\nM(B) < -10.6, thus they are less luminous than most dwarf galaxies.

One of the largest Lya nebulae, discovered at a redshift of z~2.7 via\nits strong mid-infrared emission, provides an unbiased test of this\nassociation.

This is the first study of the environment of a Lya nebula found\nwithout a priori knowledge of its surroundings.

Both the local concentration of fluorescence dye and the local\ntemperature are measured near the sidewall of a rectangular cell. It is found\nthat, although they are advected by the same turbulent flow, the two scalars\ndistribute differently. This difference is twofold, i.e. both the quantities\nthemselves and their small-scale increments have different distributions. Our\nresults show that there is a certain buoyant scale based on time domain, i.e.\nthe Bolgiano time scale $t_B$, above which buoyancy effects are significant.\nAbove $t_B$, temperature is active and is found to be more intermittent than\nconcentration, which is passive. This suggests that the active scalar possesses\na higher level of intermittency in turbulent thermal convection. It is further\nfound that the mixing of both scalar fields are isotropic for scales larger\nthan $t_B$ even though buoyancy acts on the fluid in the vertical direction.\nBelow $t_B$, temperature is passive and is found to be more anisotropic than\nconcentration. But this higher degree of anisotropy is attributed to the higher\ndiffusivity of temperature over that of concentration. From the simultaneous\nmeasurements of temperature and concentration, it is shown that two scalars\nhave similar autocorrelation functions and there is a strong and positive\ncorrelation between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 2008 05:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Its structure and dynamics have been studied previously\nthrough high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, and it appears dynamically\nsimilar to the ring structure around SN 1987A. Here we present long-slit\nspectroscopy of the circumstellar nebula around Sher 25, and of the background\nnebula of the host cluster NGC 3603. We perform a detailed nebular abundance\nanalysis to measure the gas-phase abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, neon\nand argon. The oxygen abundance in the circumstellar nebula (12 + log[O/H] =\n8.61 +/- 0.13 dex) is similar to that in the background nebula (8.56 +/- 0.07),\nsuggesting the composition of the host cluster is around solar. However, we\nconfirm that the circumstellar nebula is very rich in nitrogen, with an\nabundance of 8.91 +/- 0.15, compared to the background value of 7.47 +/- 0.18.\nA new analysis of the stellar spectrum with the FASTWIND model atmosphere code\nsuggests that the photospheric nitrogen and oxygen abundances in Sher 25 are\nconsistent with the nebular results. While the nitrogen abundances are high,\nwhen compared to stellar evolutionary models they do not unambiguously confirm\nthat the star has undergone convective dredge-up during a previous red\nsupergiant phase. We suggest that the more likely scenario is that the nebula\nwas ejected from the star while it was in the blue supergiant phase. The star's\ninitial mass was around 50 M_sun, which is rather too high for it to have had a\nconvective envelope stage as a red supergiant. Rotating stellar models that\nlead to mixing of core-processed material to the stellar surface during core\nH-burning can quantitatively match the stellar results with the nebula\nabundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 2008 12:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
