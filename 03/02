Direct approaches prove termination\ndirectly on the basis of the logic program. Transformational approaches\ntransform a logic program into a term rewrite system (TRS) and then analyze\ntermination of the resulting TRS instead. Thus, transformational approaches\nmake all methods previously developed for TRSs available for logic programs as\nwell. However, the applicability of most existing transformations is quite\nrestricted, as they can only be used for certain subclasses of logic programs.\n(Most of them are restricted to well-moded programs.) In this paper we improve\nthese transformations such that they become applicable for any definite logic\nprogram. To simulate the behavior of logic programs by TRSs, we slightly modify\nthe notion of rewriting by permitting infinite terms. We show that our\ntransformation results in TRSs which are indeed suitable for automated\ntermination analysis. In contrast to most other methods for termination of\nlogic programs, our technique is also sound for logic programming without occur\ncheck, which is typically used in practice. We implemented our approach in the\ntermination prover AProVE and successfully evaluated it on a large collection\nof examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Mar 2008 14:53:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2008 09:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-01"}

By comparing the spacecraft locations and AKR\nburst locations, the angular beaming pattern was found to be narrowly confined\nto a plane containing the magnetic field vector at the source and tangent to a\ncircle of constant latitude. Most rays paths are confined within 15 deg of this\ntangent plane, consistent with numerical simulations of AKR k-vector\norientation at maximum growth rate. The emission is also strongly directed\nupward in the tangent plane, which we interpret as refraction of the rays as\nthey leave the auroral cavity. The narrow beaming pattern implies that an\nobserver located above the polar cap can detect AKR emission only from a small\nfraction of the auroral oval at a given location. This has important\nconsequences for interpreting AKR visibility at a given location. It also helps\nre-interpret previously published Cluster VLBI studies of AKR source locations,\nwhich are now seen to be only a subset of all possible source locations.

All the four\nGRB-SNe are among a special class of Type Ic--called the broad-lined SNe\nindicative of a large explosion energy, suggesting that only a small fraction\nof SNe Ibc have GRBs associated with them. This scheme has been refreshed by\nthe discovery of a bright X-ray transient in NGC 2770 on 9 January 2008, which\nwas followed by a rather normal Type Ib SN 2008D. In this paper, I argue that\nthe transient 080109 is an X-ray flash (XRF, the soft version of a GRB) because\nof the following evidences: (1) The transient cannot be interpreted as a SN\nshock breakout event; (2) The GRB X-ray flare interpretation is not supported\nby the high-energy observation. Then I show that XRF 080109 satisfies the\nwell-known relation between the isotropic-equivalent energy and the peak\nspectral energy for LGRBs, which highly strengthens the XRF interpretation.\nFinally, I point out that, the peak spectral energy of XRF 080109 and the\nmaximum bolometric luminosity of SN 2008D agree with the\n$E_{\\gamma,\\p}$--$L_{{\\rm SN},\\max}$ relationship of Li (2006), strengthening\nthe validity of the relationship. I speculate that events like XRF 080109 may\noccur at a rate comparable to SNe Ibc, and a soft X-ray telescope devoted to\nsurveying for nearby X-ray flares will be very fruitful in discovering them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Mar 2008 21:41:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 May 2008 12:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-22"}

HI observations of galaxies and their\nenvironment have brought to light new facts and phenomena which are evidence of\nongoing or recent accretion:\n  1) A large number of galaxies are accompanied by gas-rich dwarfs or are\nsurrounded by HI cloud complexes, tails and filaments. It may be regarded as\ndirect evidence of cold gas accretion in the local universe. It is probably the\nsame kind of phenomenon of material infall as the stellar streams observed in\nthe halos of our galaxy and M31. 2) Considerable amounts of extra-planar HI\nhave been found in nearby spiral galaxies. While a large fraction of this gas\nis produced by galactic fountains, it is likely that a part of it is of\nextragalactic origin. 3) Spirals are known to have extended and warped outer\nlayers of HI. It is not clear how these have formed, and how and for how long\nthe warps can be sustained. Gas infall has been proposed as the origin. 4) The\nmajority of galactic disks are lopsided in their morphology as well as in their\nkinematics. Also here recent accretion has been advocated as a possible cause.\n  In our view, accretion takes place both through the arrival and merging of\ngas-rich satellites and through gas infall from the intergalactic medium (IGM).\nThe infall may have observable effects on the disk such as bursts of star\nformation and lopsidedness. We infer a mean ``visible'' accretion rate of cold\ngas in galaxies of at least 0.2 Msol/yr. In order to reach the accretion rates\nneeded to sustain the observed star formation (~1 Msol/yr), additional infall\nof large amounts of gas from the IGM seems to be required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Mar 2008 09:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}
