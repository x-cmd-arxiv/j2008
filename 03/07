Because the TKL is a non-bipartite lattice, dimer-dimer correlations\nare short-ranged, so that the ground state at the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point\nof the corresponding quantum dimer model on the same lattice is a short-ranged\nspin liquid. Using the Pfaffian method, we derive an exact form for the free\nenergy, and we find that the entropy is 1/3 ln2 per site, regardless of the\nweights of the bonds. The occupation probability of every bond is 1/4 in the\ncase of equal weights on every bond. Similar to the case of lattices formed by\ncorner-sharing triangles (such as the kagome and squagome lattices), we find\nthat the dimer-dimer correlation function is identically zero beyond a certain\n(short) distance. We find in addition that monomers are deconfined on the TKL,\nindicating that there is a short-ranged spin liquid phase at the RK point. We\nalso find exact results for the ground state energy of the classical Heisenberg\nmodel. The ground state can be ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, locally coplanar,\nor locally canted, depending on the couplings. From the dimer model and the\nclassical spin model, we derive upper bounds on the ground state energy of the\nquantum Heisenberg model on the TKL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2008 20:21:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 20:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-11"}

A gradual increase in\n$\\Phi_{\\rm NL}$ does not lead to a continuous increase in $d_{\\rm DNA}$ as\nobserved for DNA complexes of monovalent cationic lipids (CLs). Instead,\ndistinct spacing regimes exist, with sharp transitions between them.

Based on our\nexperimental and computational results, we conclude that the DNA condensation\nis mediated by the multivalent cationic lipids, which assemble between the\nnegatively charged DNA rods. Quite remarkably, the computational results show\nthat the less tightly packed structure in regime (ii) is thermodynamically more\nstable than the close packed structure in regime (i). Accordingly, the constant\nDNA spacing observed in regime (ii) is attributed to lateral phase coexistence\nbetween this stable CL-DNA complex and neutral membranes. This finding may\nexplain the reduced transfection efficiency measured for such complexes:\nTransfection involves endosomal escape and disassembly of the complex, and\nthese processes are inhibited by the high thermodynamic stability.

While the central role of the\ntwo-photon decay 2s->1s has been recognized for many decades, high-precision\ncalculations require us to consider two-photon decays from the higher states\nns,nd->1s (n>=3). Simple attempts to include these processes in recombination\ncalculations have suffered from physical problems associated with sequences of\none-photon decays, e.g. 3d->2p->1s, that technically also produce two photons.\nThese correspond to resonances in the two-photon spectrum that are optically\nthick, necessitating a radiative transfer calculation. We derive the\nappropriate equations, develop a numerical code to solve them, and verify the\nresults by finding agreement with analytic approximations to the radiative\ntransfer equation. The related processes of Raman scattering and two-photon\nrecombination are included using similar machinery. Our results show that early\nin recombination the two-photon decays act to speed up recombination, reducing\nthe free electron abundance by 1.3% relative to the standard calculation at\nz=1300. However we find that some photons between Ly-alpha and Ly-beta are\nproduced, mainly by 3d->1s two-photon decay and 2s->1s Raman scattering. At\nlater times these photons redshift down to Ly-alpha, excite hydrogen atoms, and\nact to slow recombination. Thus the free electron abundance is increased by\n1.3% relative to the standard calculation at z=900.

The main idea\nin the deduction is to apply the underlying symmetries of the system to show\nthat delta must be a function of r V''(r)/V'(r), and to use the transformation\nbehaviour of delta in a rotating system of reference. This is equivalent to\nsay, that the effective potential can be written in a one-parameter set of\npossibilities as sum of centrifugal potential and potential of the central\nforce. We get a universal formula for delta. It has to be read as follows: a\ncircular orbit at this value r exists and is stable if and only if this delta\nis a well-defined real; and if this is the case, then the angular difference\nfrom one perihelion to the next one for nearly circular orbits at this r is\nexactly 2 pi + delta.

The boundary local\nintegrals of motion are then systematically extracted from the asymptotic\nexpansion of the associated transfer matrix. In the case of SNP boundary\nconditions we recover previously known results. The other type of boundary\nconditions (SP), associated to the reflection algebra, are novel in this\ncontext and lead to a different set of conserved quantities that depend on free\nboundary parameters.

Naturally, questions arise, such as how to obtain the physical\nproperties of our world from the mathematical structure, or how many\npossibilities exist for a Universe minimally similar to ours.\n  In this letter we present some results which can be regarded as a\nstrengthening of MUH, as they give some hints on the derivation of spacetime in\ncurrent physics from a baggage free mathematical structure.\n  Concretely, we argue that the set of mathematical structures which can be\ninterpreted as a description of a spacetime is drastically reduced, if one\nadmits some natural postulates on minimal symmetry. Furthermore, the apparently\nvery particular form of classical Galilei-Newton and relativistic spacetimes,\nis not arbitrary and cannot be regarded as ``two possibilities among\narbitrarily many others''. In fact, such theories are determined by a single\nmathematical structure which only permits four possible types of spacetimes.\nFinally, we show how the minimal postulates on symmetry can be endowed with a\nsimple physical interpretation, i.e., they acquire ``baggage'' in a natural\nway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2008 19:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-07"}

A widely used approach is to gradually increase minimum support\nand minimum confidence or to filter the found rules using increasingly strict\nconstraints on additional measures of interestingness until the set of rules\nfound is reduced to a manageable size. In this paper we describe a different\napproach which is based on the idea to first define a set of ``interesting''\nitemsets (e.g., by a mixture of mining and expert knowledge) and then, in a\nsecond step to selectively generate rules for only these itemsets.

A generalized flow is one in which the flow out of an edge differs\nfrom the flow into the edge by a constant factor.

The system of linear equations\nthat arises at each step of the interior-point algorithm takes the form of a\nsymmetric M-matrix. We present an algorithm for solving such systems in nearly\nlinear time. The algorithm relies on the Spielman-Teng nearly linear time\nalgorithm for solving linear systems in diagonally-dominant matrices.\n  For a graph with m edges, our algorithm obtains an additive epsilon\napproximation of the maximum generalized flow and minimum cost generalized flow\nin time tildeO(m^(3/2) * log(1/epsilon)).

In particular, we discuss\nthe steady-state energy spectra of particles undergoing momentum diffusion due\nto resonant interactions with turbulent MHD modes, taking rigorously into\naccount direct energy losses connected with different radiative cooling\nprocesses. For the magnetic turbulence we assume a given power spectrum of the\ntype $W(k) \\propto k^{-q}$. In contrast to the previous approaches, however, we\nassume a finite range of turbulent wavevectors $k$, consider a variety of\nturbulence spectral indexes $1 =< q =< 2$, and concentrate on the case of a\nvery inefficient particle escape from the acceleration site. We find that for\ndifferent cooling and injection conditions, stochastic acceleration processes\ntend to establish a modified ultrarelativistic Maxwellian distribution of\nradiating particles, with the high-energy exponential cut-off shaped by the\ninterplay between cooling and acceleration rates. For example, if the timescale\nfor the dominant radiative process scales with the electron momentum as\n$\\propto p^r$, the resulting electron energy distribution is of the form\n$n_e(p) \\propto p^2 exp[ - (1 / a) (p / p_eq)^a]$, where $a = 2-q-r$, and\n$p_eq$ is the equilibrium momentum defined by the balance between stochastic\nacceleration and energy losses timescales.

Using the Infrared Array Camera and the Multiband Imaging Photometer\nonboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have obtained images of Chamaeleon I at\n3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 um. To search for new disk-bearing members of the\ncluster, we have performed spectroscopy on objects that have red colors in\nthese data. Through this work, we have discovered four new members of\nChamaeleon I with spectral types of M4, M6, M7.5, and L0. The first three\nobjects are highly embedded (A_J~5) and reside near known protostars,\nindicating that they may be among the youngest low-mass sources in the cluster\n(<1 Myr). The L0 source is the coolest known member of Chamaeleon I. Its\nluminosity implies a mass of 0.004-0.01 M_sun, making it the least massive\nbrown dwarf for which a circumstellar disk has been reliably detected. To\ncharacterize the disk population in Chamaeleon I, we have classified the\ninfrared spectral energy distributions of the 203 known members that are\nencompassed by the Spitzer images. Through these classifications, we find that\nthe disk fraction in Chamaeleon I is roughly constant at ~50% from 0.01 to 0.3\nM_sun. These data are similar to the disk fraction of IC 348, which is a denser\ncluster at the same age as Chamaeleon I. However, the disk fraction at M>1\nM_sun is significantly higher in Chamaeleon I than in IC 348 (65% vs. 20%),\nindicating longer disk lifetimes in Chamaeleon I for this mass range. Thus,\nlow-density star-forming regions like Chamaeleon I may offer more time for\nplanet formation around solar-type stars than denser clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2008 03:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

In social dilemma games with cyclically competing\nstrategies and homogeneous adaptation rates, altruistic strategies are often\nrelatively weak and cannot survive in finite-size populations. In such\nsituations, heterogeneous adaptation rates save coexistence of different\nstrategies and hence promote altruism.

In this paper we consider the possible explanations of this\napparent mass dependence in the evolutionary status of these cores, and the\nimplications for protostellar evolution and the mapping of the embedded core\nmass function (CMF) onto the stellar IMF. We consider the following potential\ncauses: dust temperature; selection effects in the submillimetre and in the\nmid-infrared observations used for pre/protostellar classification; confusion\nand multiplicity; transient cores; and varying evolutionary timescales. We\ndevelop Core Mass Evolution Diagrams (CMEDs) to investigate how the mass\nevolution of individual cores maps onto the observed CMF. Two physical\nmechanisms -- short timescales for the evolution of massive cores, and\ncontinuing accumulation of mass onto protostellar cores -- best explain the\nrelative excess of protostars in high mass cores and the rarity of massive\nstarless cores. In addition, confusion both increases the likelihood that a\nprotostar is identified within a core, and increases mass assigned to a core.\nThe observed pre/protostellar mass distributions are consistent with faster\nevolution and a shorter lifetime for higher-mass prestellar cores. We rule out\nlonger timescales for higher-mass prestellar cores. The differences in the\nprestellar and protostellar mass distributions imply that the prestellar CMF\n(and possibly the combined pre+protostellar CMF) should be steeper than the\nIMF.

A vectorial finite element method (FEM) is a good choice\nfor an accurate modeling of complicated geometrical features. However, from a\nnumerical point of view solving the arising system of linear equations is very\ndemanding even for medium sized 3D domains. In numerics, a domain decomposition\nmethod is a commonly used strategy to overcome this problem. Within this\napproach the overall computational domain is split up into smaller domains and\ninterface conditions are used to assure continuity of the electromagnetic\nfield.

This requires us\nto tackle the challenge of simulating open-ended evolution at all levels in a\nsingle simulation. The simulation should encompass not only biological\nevolution, but also physical evolution (a level below) and cultural evolution\n(a level above). The simulation would allow us to probe what would happen if we\nwould \"replay the tape of the universe\" with the same or different laws and\ninitial conditions. We also distinguish between real-world and artificial-world\nmodelling. Assuming that intelligent life could indeed simulate an entire\nuniverse, this leads to two tentative hypotheses. Some authors have argued that\nwe may already be in a simulation run by an intelligent entity. Or, if such a\nsimulation could be made real, this would lead to the production of a new\nuniverse. This last direction is argued with a careful speculative\nphilosophical approach, emphasizing the imperative to find a solution to the\nheat death problem in cosmology.

For N > 4, however, there is a first order bulk transition that cleanly\nseparates the strong and weak coupling regimes. We find that in this case the\ncalculated string tension can be readily fitted throughout the weak coupling\nregion by a standard 3-loop expression modified by lattice spacing corrections\nof the expected form. While our fits demand the presence of the latter, they do\nnot constrain the perturbative coupling scheme enough to enable us to extract a\nusefully accurate value of a(beta) in units of Lambda_MSbar. To resolve this\nambiguity we turn to SU(3) where we use the Schrodinger Functional coupling\nscheme to extract a value of r_0 x Lambda_SF as a benchmark. We then find that\nthe Parisi mean-field improved coupling scheme closely reproduces this result.\nWe also develop a comparison between different schemes that does not rely on\nthe calculation of any physical quantity and which can therefore be applied\nmuch further into weak coupling. Again the Parisi scheme is favoured over the\nothers that we compare.

Because of the\nwireless sensor's limited infrastructure, the bottleneck challenge for\ndeploying these algorithms is the key distribution. For the same reason of\nresources restriction, key distribution mechanisms which are used in\ntraditional wireless networks are not efficient for sensor networks.\n  To overcome the key distribution problem, several key pre-distribution\nalgorithms and techniques that assign keys or keying material for the networks\nnodes in an offline phase have been introduced recently.

The ratio between the vertical and horizontal kinetic energies\n($V^2/H^2$) can be measured from 5 to 25Hz and shows an abrupt transitionfrom\n0.1 in the 5-10Hz band, to about 0.8 in the 15-25Hz band.
