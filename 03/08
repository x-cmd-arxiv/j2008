We formalize the\nrobustness of state probabilities to reaction rate deviations, and describe a\nformal connection between robustness and efficiency of simulation. Without\nrobustness guarantees, stochastic simulation seems to require computational\ntime proportional to the total number of reaction events. Even if the\nconcentration (molecular count per volume) stays bounded, the number of\nreaction events can be linear in the duration of simulated time and total\nmolecular count. We show that the behavior of robust systems can be predicted\nsuch that the computational work scales linearly with the duration of simulated\ntime and concentration, and only polylogarithmically in the total molecular\ncount. Thus our asymptotic analysis captures the dramatic speedup when\nmolecular counts are large, and shows that for bounded concentrations the\ncomputation time is essentially invariant with molecular count. Finally, by\nnoticing that even robust stochastic chemical reaction networks are capable of\nembedding complex computational problems, we argue that the linear dependence\non simulated time and concentration is likely optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2008 17:36:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2008 02:10:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2009 09:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-28"}

If\ndescribed by a simple one-parameter model, we find a characteristic delay time\nof 2-3 Gyr. However, a number of recent results based on e.g., low redshift\nsupernova samples and supernova host galaxy properties suggest that the\nsupernova delay time distribution is bimodal. In this model, a major fraction\nof the Type Ia supernova rate is 'prompt' and follows the star formation rate,\nwhile a smaller fraction of the rate has a long delay time, making this channel\nproportional to mass. While our results are fully consistent with the bimodal\nmodel at low redshifts, the low rate we find at z>1.4 appears to contradict\nthese results.

Presence and level of magnetic activity\ndepend on star's rotation and rotation itself is strongly influenced by\nstrength and topology of the magnetic fields. Open clusters represent\nespecially useful targets to investigate the connection between rotation and\nactivity. The open cluster NGC2099 has been studied as a part of the RACE-OC\nproject, which is aimed at exploring the evolution of rotation and magnetic\nactivity in the late-type members of open clusters of different ages. Time\nseries CCD photometric observations of this cluster were collected during\nJanuary 2004. The relations between activity manifestations, such as the light\ncurve amplitude, and global stellar parameters are investigated. We have\ndiscovered 135 periodic variables, 122 of which are candidate cluster members.\nDetermination of rotation periods of G- and K-type stars has allowed us to\nbetter explore evolution of angular momentum at an age of about 500 Myr. A\ncomparison with the older Hyades cluster (~625 Myr) shows that the newly\ndetermined distribution of rotation periods is consistent with the scenario of\nrotational braking of main-sequence spotted stars as they age. However, a\ncomparison with the younger M34 cluster (~200 Myr) shows that the G8-K5 members\nof these clusters have the same rotation period distribution, that is G8-K5\nmembers in NGC2099 seem to have experienced no significant braking in the age\nrange from ~200 to ~500 Myr. Finally, NGC2099 members have a level of\nphotospheric magnetic activity, as measured by light curve amplitude, smaller\nthan in younger stars of same mass and rotation, suggesting that the activity\nlevel also depends on some other age-dependent parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2008 17:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We verify the excess of Class I\nbinary stars over solar-type main-sequence stars, especially at separations\nbeyond 500 AU. Although our sources are in nearby star forming regions\ndistributed across the entire sky (including Orion), none of our objects are in\na high stellar density environment. The binary separation distribution changes\nsignificantly during the Class I phase, and the binary frequency at separations\ngreater than 1000 AU declines steadily with respect to spectral index. Despite\nthese changes, the binary frequency remains constant until the end of the Class\nI phase, when it drops sharply. We propose a scenario to account for the\nchanges in the Class I binary separation distribution. This scenario postulates\nthat companions with a separation greater than ~1000 AU were ejected during the\nClass 0 phase, but remain gravitationally bound due to the mass of the\nenvelope. As the envelope dissipates, these companions become unbound and the\nbinary frequency at wide separations declines. This scenario predicts that a\nlarge number of Class 0 objects should be non-hierarchical multiple systems,\nand that many Class I YSOs with a widely separated companion should also have a\nvery close companion. We also find that Class I protostars are not dynamically\npristine, and have experienced dynamical evolution before they are visible as\nClass I objects. For the first time, evidence is presented showing that the\nClass I binary frequency and the binary separation distribution strongly depend\non the star forming environment. The reason for this dependence remains\nunclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2008 20:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Observations have been obtained in Lya and H-alpha\n(Ha) and 6 continuum filters between ~1500AA and the I-band. Previously (Hayes\net al 2005) we demonstrated that the production of Lya line-only images in the\nSBC-only data-set is non-trivial and that supporting data is a requirement. We\nhere develop various methods of continuum subtraction and assess their relative\nperformance using a variety of spectral energy distributions (SED) as input.

Moreover, a single component stellar\nor stellar+nebular spectrum is not always sufficient for realistic template\nSEDs and, in order to successfully recover the input observables, care must be\ntaken to control contributions of nebular gas and underlying stellar\npopulations.

Here, we introduce a new gas-grain chemical network, wherein a wide\narray of complex species may be formed by reactions involving radicals. The\nradicals we consider (H, OH, CO, HCO, CH3, CH3O, CH2OH, NH and NH2) are\nproduced primarily by cosmic ray-induced photodissociation of the granular ices\nformed during the colder, earlier stages of evolution. The gradual warm-up of\nthe hot core is crucial to the formation of complex molecules, allowing the\nmore strongly-bound radicals to become mobile on grain surfaces. This type of\nchemistry is capable of reproducing the high degree of complexity seen in Sgr\nB2(N), and can explain the observed abundances and temperatures of a variety of\npreviously detected complex organic molecules, including structural isomers.\nMany other complex species are predicted by this model, and several of these\nspecies may be detectable in hot cores. Differences in the chemistry of high-\nand low-mass star-formation are also addressed; greater chemical complexity is\nexpected where evolution timescales are longer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2008 04:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A radiative-transport code was\nused for this purpose to get the disturbances of the opacities from temperature\nand density fluctuations. The visibility and darkening functions are obtained\nfor adiabatic oscillations under the assumption that the temperature\ndisturbances are proportional to the undisturbed temperature of the\nphotosphere. The latter assumption is the only way to explore any opacity\neffects since the eigenfunctions of p-mode oscillations have not been obtained\nso far. This investigation reveals that opacity effects have to be taken into\naccount because they dominate the violet and infrared part of the spectrum.\nBecause of this dominance, the visibility functions are negative for those\nparts of the spectrum. Furthermore, the darkening functions show a\nwavelength-dependent change of sign for some wavelengths owing to these opacity\neffects. However, the visibility and darkening functions under the assumptions\nused contradict the observations of global p-mode oscillations, but it is\nbeyond doubt that the opacity effects influence the brightness fluctuations of\nthe Sun resulting from global oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2008 09:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-11"}

First, the existence of the top-pions and\ntop-higgs can modify the $Wtb$ coupling via their loop contributions, and such\nmodification can cause the correction to the cross sections of all three\nproduction modes.
