We present our\ndetailed optical and infrared observations of the afterglow, consisting of over\n5000 images starting 51 s after the GRB trigger, in concert with our own\nanalysis of the Swift data. The event is extreme not only in observed\nproperties but intrinsically: it was the most luminous event ever recorded at\noptical and infrared wavelengths and had an exceedingly high\nisotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays. At early times, the\nafterglow evolution is broadly consistent with being reverse-shock dominated,\nbut then is subsumed by a forward shock at around 1000 s. The overall spectral\nenergy distribution, spanning from ultraviolet through near-infrared\nwavelengths, shows no evidence for a significant amount of dust extinction in\nthe host frame. The afterglow evolution, however, is highly chromatic: starting\nat about 1000 s the index shifts blueward before shifting back to the red at\nlate times. In our deepest late-time observations, we find tentative evidence\nfor an optical jet break and a luminous supernova. Finally, we examine the\ndetectability of such events with current and future facilities and find that\nsuch an event could be detected in gamma-rays by BAT out to z = 10.7 (8 sigma),\nwhile the nominal EXIST sensitivity would allow detection to z ~ 32. At K band,\nthis source would have been easily detected with meter-class telescopes to z ~\n17.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2008 18:29:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2008 22:32:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2008 19:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Arguments in which a concept of energy plays a role, in the\ncontext of hydro-thermodynamical systems and gravitation, are often flawed, and\nsome familiar results concerning the stability of model stellar structures,\nfirst advanced at the end of the 19th century and repeated in the most modern\ntextbooks, are less than completely convincing. 3. The standard treatment of\nrelativistic thermodynamics does not allow for a systematic treatment of\nmixtures, such as the mixture of a perfect gas with radiation. 4. The concept\nof mass in applications of general relativity to stellar structure is\nunsatisfactory. It is proposed that a formulation of thermodynamics as an\naction principle may be a suitable approach to adopt for a new investigation of\nthese matters.\n  We formulate thermodynamics of ideal gases in terms of an action principle\nand study the interaction between an ideal gas and the photon gas, or heat.

Here we study how the inhomogeneous intergalactic medium\n(IGM) evolves inside such fossils. The average recombination rate declines\nrapidly with time, and the brief quasar episode significantly increases the\nmean free path inside the fossil bubbles. As a result, even a weak ionizing\nbackground generated by galaxies inside the fossil can maintain it in a\nrelatively highly and uniformly ionized state. For example, galaxies that would\nionize 20-30% of hydrogen in a random patch of the IGM can maintain 80-90%\nionization inside the fossil, for a duration much longer than the average\nrecombination time in the IGM. Quasar fossils at z<10 thus retain their\nidentity for nearly a Hubble time, and will appear \"gray,'' distinct from both\nthe average IGM (which has a \"swiss-cheese\" ionization topology and a lower\nmean ionized fraction), and from fully-ionized bubbles around active quasars.\nMore distant fossils, at z>10 have a weaker galaxy-generated ionizing\nbackground and a higher gas density, so they can attain a swiss-cheese topology\nsimilar to the rest of the IGM, but with a smaller contrast between the ionized\nbubbles and the partially neutral regions separating them. Analogous\nHeIII-fossils should exist around the epoch of HeII/HeIII reionization at z~3,\nalthough rapid recombinations inside the HeIII-fossils will be more common. Our\nmodel of inhomogeneous recombination also applies to \"double reionization''\nmodels and shows that a non-monotonic reionization history is even more\nunlikely than previously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2008 20:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It has recently\nbeen suggested that in the low-stimulus regime (h ~ 0) the response function\nF(h) of hypercubic deterministic systems behaves as a power law, F ~ h^m.\nMoreover the response exponent m has been predicted to depend only on the\ndimensionality d of the lattice, m = 1/(1+d) [T. Ohta and T. Yoshimura, Physica\nD 205, 189 (2005)]. In order to test this prediction, we study the response\nfunction of excitable lattices modeled by either coupled Morris-Lecar equations\nor Greenberg-Hastings cellular automata. We show that the prediction is\nverified in our model systems for d = 1, 2, and 3, provided that a minimum set\nof conditions is satisfied. Under these conditions, the dynamic range - which\nmeasures the range of stimulus intensities that can be coded by the network\nactivity - increases with the dimensionality d of the network. The power law\nscenario breaks down, however, if the system can exhibit self-sustained\nactivity (spiral waves). In this case, we recover a scenario that is common to\nprobabilistic excitable media: as a function of the conductance coupling G\namong the excitable elements, the dynamic range is maximized precisely at the\ncritical value G_c above which self-sustained activity becomes stable. We\ndiscuss the implications of these results in the context of neural coding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2008 21:35:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 May 2008 18:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-22"}

Our previous\nanalysis indicates that this stream, as well as several other observed\nfeatures, are products of the tidal disruption of a single satellite galaxy\nwith stellar mass ~10^9 solar masses less than 1 Gyr ago. Here we show that the\nspecific observed morphology of the stream and halo debris favors a cold,\nrotating, disk-like progenitor over a dynamically hot, non-rotating one. These\nobserved characteristics include the asymmetric distribution of stars along the\nstream cross-section and its metal-rich core/metal-poor sheath structure. We\nfind that a disk-like progenitor can also give rise to arc-like features on the\nminor axis at certain orbital phases that resemble the recently discovered\nminor-axis \"streams\", even reproducing the lower observed metallicity of these\nstreams. Though interpreted by the discoverers as new, independent tidal\nstreams, our analysis suggests that these minor-axis streams may alternatively\narise from the progenitor of the giant southern stream.

Brown dwarf companions to stars at separations of a few AU or less\nare rare objects, and none have been found so far around early-type M dwarfs\nM0V-M5V). With GJ 1046 (M2.5V), a strong candidate for such a system with a\nseparation of 0.42 AU is presented.\n  Aims. We aim at constraining the mass of the companion in order to decide\nwhether it is a brown dwarf or a low-mass star.\n  Methods. We employed precision RV measurements to determine the orbital\nparameters and the minimum companion mass. We then derived an upper limit to\nthe companion mass from the lack of disturbances of the RV measurements by a\nsecondary spectrum. An even tighter upper limit is subsequently established by\ncombining the RV-derived orbital parameters with the recent new version of the\nHipparcos Intermediate Astrometric Data.\n  Results. For the mass of the companion, we derive m>26.9 MJup from the RV\ndata. Based on the RV data alone, the probability that the companion exceeds\nthe stellar mass threshold is just 6.2%. The absence of effects from the\nsecondary spectrum lets us constrain the companion mass to m <229 MJup. The\ncombination of RV and Hipparcos data yields a 3sigma upper mass limit to the\ncompanion mass of 112 MJup with a formal optimum value at m=47.2 MJup. From the\ncombination of RV and astrometric data, the chance probability that the\ncompanion is a star is 2.9%.\n  Conclusions. We have found a low-mass, close companion to an early-type M\ndwarf.

The density of the system is required to be a\nproduct of functions separable in the potential and the radial coordinate,\nwhere the functions of the radial coordinate are powers of a sum of a square of\nthe radial coordinate and its unit scale. The even part of the two-integral DF\ncorresponding to this type of density is in turn a sum or an infinite series of\nproducts of functions of the energy and of the magnitude of the angular\nmomentum about the axis of symmetry. A similar expression of its odd part can\nbe also obtained under the assumption of the rotation laws. It can be further\nshown that these expressions are in fact equivalent to those obtained by using\nHunter and Qian's contour integral formulae for the system. This method is\ngenerally computationally preferable to the contour integral method. Two\nexamples are given to obtain the even and odd parts of their two-integral DFs.\nOne is for the prolate Jaffe model and the other for the prolate Plummer model.\n  It can be also found that the Hunter-Qian contour integral formulae of the\ntwo-integral even DF for axisymmetric systems can be recovered by use of the\nLaplace-Mellin integral transformation originally developed by Dejonghe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2008 13:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25"}

This novel feature, while stemming\nfrom the exchange interaction, has been used to unambiguously distinguish the\ndifferent spin dynamics ($T_2^{1*}$ and $T_2^{2*}$) for the first and second\nsubbands under the different conditions by their KR signs (negative for\n$1^{st}$ and positive for $2^{nd}$).

The applicability of this elemental pair needs to be established for\nstellar spectroscopy. Aims: We aim at a spectroscopic determination of the\nabundance of Hf and Th in the solar photosphere based on a \\cobold 3D\nhydrodynamical model atmosphere. We put this into a wider context by\ninvestigating 3D abundance corrections for a set of G- and F-type dwarfs.\nMethod: High-resolution, high signal-to-noise solar spectra were compared to\nline synthesis calculations performed on a solar CO5BOLD model. For the other\natmospheres, we compared synthetic spectra of CO5BOLD 3D and associated 1D\nmodels. Results: For Hf we find a photospheric abundance A(Hf)=0.87+-0.04, in\ngood agreement with a previous analysis, based on 1D model atmospheres. The\nweak Th ii 401.9 nm line constitutes the only Th abundance indicator available\nin the solar spectrum. It lies in the red wing of an Ni-Fe blend exhibiting a\nnon-negligible convective asymmetry. Accounting for the asymmetry-related\nadditional absorption, we obtain A(Th)=0.09+-0.03, consistent with the\nmeteoritic abundance, and about 0.1 dex lower than obtained in previous\nphotospheric abundance determinations. Conclusions: Only for the second time,\nto our knowledge, has am non-negligible effect of convective line asymmetries\non an abundance derivation been highlighted. Three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations should be employed to measure Th abundances in dwarfs if similar\nblending is present, as in the solar case.
