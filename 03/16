Our goal is to\nestablish the detailed characteristics of the thick disks obtained in this way,\nas well as their dependence on the initial orbital and internal properties of\nthe accreted objects. We find that mergers with 10-20% mass of the mass of the\nhost lead to the formation of thick disks whose characteristics are similar,\nboth in morphology as in kinematics, to those observed. Despite the relatively\nlarge mass ratios, the host disks are not fully destroyed by the infalling\nsatellites: a remaining kinematically cold and thin component containing\n~15-25% of the mass can be identified, which is embedded in a hotter and\nthicker disk. This may for example, explain the existence of a very old thin\ndisk stars in the Milky Way. The final scale-heights of the disks depend both\non the initial inclination and properties of the merger, but the fraction of\nsatellite stellar particles at ~4 scale-heights directly measures the mass\nratio between the satellite and host galaxy. Our thick disks typically show\nboxy isophotes at very low surface brightness levels (>6 magnitudes below their\npeak value). Kinematically, the velocity ellipsoids of the simulated thick\ndisks are similar to that of the Galactic thick disk at the solar radius. The\ntrend of sigma_Z/sigma_R with radius is found to be a very good discriminant of\nthe initial inclination of the accreted satellite.
