Recent\nworks have shown that sophisticated linear processing such as beamforming and\ndistributed space-time coding (DSTC) at relays enables to improve the AF\nperformance. However, the relative utility of these strategies depend on the\navailable channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), which in turn\ndepends on system parameters such as the speed of the underlying fading channel\nand that of training and feedback procedures. Moreover, it is of practical\ninterest to have a single transmit scheme that handles different CSIT\nscenarios. This motivates us to consider a unified approach based on DSTC that\npotentially provides diversity gain with statistical CSIT and exploits some\nadditional side information if available. Under individual power constraints at\nthe relays, we optimize the amplifier power allocation such that pairwise error\nprobability conditioned on the available CSIT is minimized. Under perfect CSIT\nwe propose an on-off gradient algorithm that efficiently finds a set of relays\nto switch on. Under partial and statistical CSIT, we propose a simple\nwaterfilling algorithm that yields a non-trivial solution between maximum power\nallocation and a generalized STC that equalizes the averaged amplified noise\nfor all relays. Moreover, we derive closed-form solutions for M=2 and in\ncertain asymptotic regimes that enable an easy interpretation of the proposed\nalgorithms. It is found that an appropriate amplifier power allocation is\nmandatory for DSTC to offer sufficient diversity and power gain in a general\nnetwork topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2008 18:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-20"}

For modeling, it usually comes to coupling a reactor model\n(describing the phenomena at the macroscopic scale) with a so-called grain\nmodel (simulating the behavior of a single grain or a particle). An interesting\napproach proposed by H.Y. Sohn (1978) is to use the law of additive reaction\ntimes in order to calculate, approximately but analytically, the reaction rate\nof a particle in the reactor model. Its great advantage, compared to a\nnumerical grain model, is to drastically reduce the computation time,\nparticularly in the case of complex reactor models. This is the approach we\nretained for modeling the moving bed furnace, a counter-current gas-solid\nreactor used in the nuclear fuel-making route for producing uranium\ntetrafluoride from uranium trioxide. The numerical model we developed is\n2-dimensional, steady-state and based on the finite volume method. It describes\nsolid and gas flow, convective, conductive and radiative heat transfers, and\nsix chemical reactions involved in the process. The law of additive reaction\ntimes is used to calculate analytically the rate of the three principal\ngas-solid reactions at every discrete point in the reactor. We have\ndemonstrated the validity of this approach by comparing its results with those\ncalculated from a numerical grain model. Also detailed in the paper are the\nmain results of the moving bed furnace model itself and the possibilities of\noptimizing the process revealed by the calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2008 16:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

The nanotube is a long channel opened at one end and its\ndiameter $D$ is much smaller than the size of the polymer coil in solution. We\nanalyze the following characteristics as functions of the chain end position\n$x$ inside the tube: the free energy of confinement, the average end-to-end\ndistance, the average number of imprisoned monomers, and the average stretching\nof the confined part of the chain for various values of $D$ and for the number\nof monomers in the chain, $N$. We show that when the chain end is dragged by a\ncertain critical distance $x^*$ into the tube, the polymer undergoes a\nfirst-order phase transition whereby the remaining free tail is abruptly sucked\ninto the tube. This is accompanied by jumps in the average size, the number of\nimprisoned segments, and in the average stretching parameter. The critical\ndistance scales as $x^*\\sim ND^{1-1/\\nu}$. The transition takes place when\napproximately 3/4 of the chain units are dragged into the tube. The theory\npresented is based on constructing the Landau free energy as a function of an\norder parameter that provides a complete description of equilibrium and\nmetastable states. We argue that if the trapped chain is released with all\nmonomers allowed to fluctuate, the reverse process in which the chain leaves\nthe confinement occurs smoothly without any jumps. Finally, we apply the theory\nto estimate the lifetime of confined DNA in metastable states in nanotubes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2008 17:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Unlike regular enveloped\nviruses, retrovirus budding happens {\\em concurrently} with the self-assembly\nof retrovirus protein subunits (Gags) into spherical virus capsids on the cell\nmembrane. Led by this unique budding and assembly mechanism, we study the free\nenergy profile of retrovirus budding, taking into account of the Gag-Gag\nattraction energy and the membrane elastic energy. We find that if the Gag-Gag\nattraction is strong, budding always proceeds to completion. During early stage\nof budding, the zenith angle of partial budded capsids, $\\alpha$, increases\nwith time as $\\alpha \\propto t^{1/3}$.

The\ngeneralization of kernel Granger causality to the multivariate case, here\npresented, shares the following features with the bivariate measures: (i) the\nnonlinearity of the regression model can be controlled by choosing the kernel\nfunction and (ii) the problem of false-causalities, arising as the complexity\nof the model increases, is addressed by a selection strategy of the\neigenvectors of a reduced Gram matrix whose range represents the additional\nfeatures due to the second time series. Moreover, there is no {\\it a priori}\nassumption that the network must be a directed acyclic graph.

It could either be the first low-mass X-ray binary\nsystem discovered inside a SNR, or a peculiar isolated magnetar with an\nextremely slow spin period.

We find no compelling reasons to associate any of\nthe candidates to 1E 1613. On one side, within the frame of the binary system\nmodel for the X-ray source, it is very unlikely that one of the candidates be a\nlow-mass companion star to 1E 1613. On the other side, if the X-ray source is\nan isolated magnetar surrounded by a fallback disc, we cannot exclude that the\nIR counterpart be hidden among the candidates. If none of the potential\ncounterparts is linked to the X-ray source, 1E 1613 would remain undetected in\nthe IR down to Ks>22.1. Such an upper limit is consistent only with an\nextremely low-mass star (an M6-M8 dwarf) at the position of 1E 1613, and makes\nrather problematic the interpretation of 1E 1613 as an accreting binary system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2008 20:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Often, there is no obvious\nexternal cause, such as an interaction with a nearby galaxy, for such features.\nAlternatively, the lopsidedness may have an internal cause, such as a dynamical\ninstability. In order to explore this idea, we have developed a computer code\nthat searches for self-consistent perturbations in razor-thin disc galaxies and\nperformed a thorough mode-analysis of a suite of dynamical models for disc\ngalaxies embedded in an inert dark-matter halo with varying amounts of rotation\nand radial anisotropy. Models with two equal-mass counter-rotating discs and\nfully rotating models both show growing lopsided modes. For the\ncounter-rotating models, this is the well-known counter-rotating instability,\nbecoming weaker as the net rotation increases. The m=1 mode of the maximally\nrotating models, on the other hand, becomes stronger with increasing net\nrotation. This rotating m=1 mode is reminiscent of the eccentricity instability\nin near-Keplerian discs. To unravel the physical origin of these two different\nm=1 instabilities, we studied the individual stellar orbits in the perturbed\npotential and found that the presence of the perturbation gives rise to a very\nrich orbital behaviour. In the linear regime, both instabilities are supported\nby aligned loop orbits. In the non-linear regime, other orbit families exist\nthat can help support the modes. In terms of density waves, the\ncounter-rotating m=1 mode is due to a purely growing Jeans-type instability.\nThe rotating m=1 mode, on the other hand, grows as a result of the swing\namplifier working inside the resonance cavity that extends from the disc center\nout to the radius where non-rotating waves are stabilized by the model's\noutwardly rising Q-profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2008 21:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In\nfact, all attempts to define a sound distance measure on the class of all\nphylogenetic networks have failed so far. Thus, the only practical solutions\nhave been either the use of rough estimates of similarity (based on comparison\nof the trees embedded in the networks), or narrowing the class of phylogenetic\nnetworks to a certain class where such a distance is known and can be\nefficiently computed. The first approach has the problem that one may identify\ntwo networks as equivalent, when they are not; the second one has the drawback\nthat there may not exist algorithms to reconstruct such networks from\nbiological sequences.\n  We present in this paper a distance measure on the class of tree-sibling time\nconsistent phylogenetic networks, which generalize tree-child time consistent\nphylogenetic networks, and thus also galled-trees.

In this paper, we develop a dynamic effective\nmedium theory (EMT) for a system containing rotating particles of finite volume\nfraction. This is a generalization of established EMT to account for the\ninteractions between many rotating particles. While the theory is valid for\nthree dimensions, the results in a special two dimensional configuration show\nthat the system exhibits an off-diagonal polarization response, in addition to\na diagonal polarization response, which resembles the classic Hall effect. The\ndiagonal response monotonically decreases with an increasing rotational speed,\nwhereas the off-diagonal response exhibits a maximum at a reduced rotational\nangular velocity $\\omega_0$ comparing to the case of isolated rotating\nparticles. This implies a way of measurement on the interacting relaxation\ntime.

Unlike previous work that used Genetic Algorithms (ga) to implement\nimplicit learning, the learning in the proposed algorithm is explicit, i.e. we\nidentify and mix building blocks directly. The eda is applied to implement such\nexplicit learning by building a Bayesian network of the joint distribution of\nsolutions. The conditional probability of each variable in the network is\ncomputed according to an initial set of promising solutions. Subsequently, each\nnew instance for each variable is generated by using the corresponding\nconditional probabilities, until all variables have been generated, i.e. in our\ncase, a new rule string has been obtained. Another set of rule strings will be\ngenerated in this way, some of which will replace previous strings based on\nfitness selection. If stopping conditions are not met, the conditional\nprobabilities for all nodes in the Bayesian network are updated again using the\ncurrent set of promising rule strings.

The aim of this paper is to develop a differential--geometrical\nframework of a perturbation model (called the perturbation manifold) and\nutilize associated metric tensor and affine curvatures to resolve these issues.\nWe will show that the metric tensor of the perturbation manifold provides\nimportant information about selecting an appropriate perturbation of a model.\nMoreover, we will introduce new influence measures that are applicable to\nobjective functions at any point. Examples including linear regression models\nand linear mixed models are examined to demonstrate the effectiveness of using\nnew influence measures for the identification of influential observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2008 13:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

We confirm that the scatter in the z~0.6 TFR\nis caused by galaxies with anomalous kinematics, and find a positive and strong\ncorrelation between the complexity of the kinematics and the scatter that they\ncontribute to the TFR. Considering only relaxed-rotating disks, the scatter,\nand possibly also the slope of the TFR, do not appear to evolve with z.

(2006) are attributed to\nboth an improvement of the local TFR and the more detailed accurate measurement\nof the rotation velocities in the distant sample. Most of the uncertainty can\nbe explained by the relatively coarse spatial-resolution of the kinematical\ndata. Because most rotating disks at z~0.6 are unlikely to experience further\nmerging events, one may assume that their rotational velocity does not evolve\ndramatically. If true, our result implies that rotating disks observed at z~0.6\nare rapidly transforming their gas into stars, to be able to double their\nstellar masses and be observed on the TFR at z=0. The rotating disks observed\nare indeed emission-line galaxies that are either starbursts or LIRGs, which\nimplies that they are forming stars at a high rate.

This so-called veiling is normally identified with an\nexcess continuous emission formed in shock-heated gas at the stellar surface\nbelow the accretion streams. We have selected four stars (RW Aur A, RU Lup, S\nCrA NW and S CrA SE) with unusually strong veiling to make a detailed\ninvestigation of veiling versus stellar brightness and emission line strengths\nfor comparisons to standard accretion models. We have monitored the stars\nphotometrically and spectroscopically at several epochs. In standard accretion\nmodels a variable accretion rate will lead to a variable excess emission.\nConsequently, the stellar brightness should vary accordingly. We find that the\nveiling of absorption lines in these stars is strongly variable and usually so\nlarge that it would require the release of several stellar luminosities of\npotential energy. At states of very large line dilution, the correspondingly\nlarge veiling factors derived correlate only weakly with brightness. Moreover,\nthe emission line strengths violate the expected trend of veiling versus line\nstrength. The veiling can change dramatically in one night, and is not\ncorrelated with the phase of the rotation periods found for two stars. We show\nthat in at least three of the stars, when the veiling becomes high, the\nphotospheric lines become filled-in by line emission, which produces large\nveiling factors unrelated to changes in any continuous emission from shocked\nregions. We also consider to what extent extinction by dust and electron\nscattering in the accretion stream may affect veiling measures in CTTS. We\nconclude that the degree of veiling cannot be used as a measure of accretion\nrates in CTTS with rich emission line spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2008 15:06:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 17:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
