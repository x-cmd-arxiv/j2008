We start with how its violation\ncan be related to the expected idea of unification of particle physics and\ngravitation, an attempt beyond the standard theories, including general\nrelativity of Einstein. A particular emphasis will be placed on the issue of an\naccelerating universe, a rather recent development since nearly 10 years ago,\nsuggesting a strong motivation toward attempts beyond the conventional concepts\nof the traditional cosmology. We face today's version of the cosmological\nconstant problem. A candidate of the new ingredient appears to be provided by a\nscalar field, sometimes under the names like quintessence or dark-energy. In\nthis article, we discuss the subject from a point of view of a more theoretical\napproach based on the scalar-tensor theory of gravitation. By exploiting the\nconcepts of conformal transformations and conformal frames unique to this type\nof approach, we show that a successful understanding of the observed\ncosmological acceleration entails an unexpected outcome of breakdown of WEP,\nwhich may show up as a distinct behavior between hydrogen and antihydrogen in\nthe gravitational influence, from a further wider perspective including a\nvector field as well.

Upon introducing a degree of nonconformality comparable to\nthat seen in lattice calculations of QCD at temperatures a few times that of\nthe crossover to quark-gluon plasma, we find that the jet quenching parameter\nis affected by the nonconformality by at most 30%, the screening length is\naffected by at most 20%, but the drag and diffusion coefficients for a slowly\nmoving heavy quark can be modified by as much as 80%.

A large observational follow-up\neffort to obtain redshifts for these SZ-detected clusters is under way. Given\nthe large area covered by these surveys, most of the redshifts will be obtained\nvia the photometric redshift (photo-z) technique. Here we demonstrate, in an\napplication using ~3000 SDSS stripe 82 galaxies with r<20, how the addition of\nGALEX photometry (FUV, NUV) greatly improves the photometric redshifts of\ngalaxies obtained with optical griz or ugriz photometry. In the case where\nlarge spectroscopic training sets are available, empirical neural-network-based\ntechniques (e.g., ANNz) can yield a photo-z scatter of $\\sigma_z = 0.018\n(1+z)$. If large spectroscopic training sets are not available, the addition of\nGALEX data makes possible the use simple maximum likelihood techniques, without\nresorting to Bayesian priors, and obtains $\\sigma_z=0.04(1+z)$, accuracy that\napproaches the accuracy obtained using spectroscopic training of neural\nnetworks on ugriz observations.

Support has some\nknown problems with rare items, favors shorter itemsets and sometimes produces\nmisleading associations.\n  In this paper we develop a novel model-based frequency constraint as an\nalternative to a single, user-specified minimum support. The constraint\nutilizes knowledge of the process generating transaction data by applying a\nsimple stochastic mixture model (the NB model) which allows for transaction\ndata's typically highly skewed item frequency distribution. A user-specified\nprecision threshold is used together with the model to find local frequency\nthresholds for groups of itemsets. Based on the constraint we develop the\nnotion of NB-frequent itemsets and adapt a mining algorithm to find all\nNB-frequent itemsets in a database.

These billiards have mixed\nregular-chaotic dynamics but different structures in their classical phase\nspaces. The spectrum of each billiard is represented as a time series where the\nlevel order plays the role of time. Two most important findings follow from the\ntime-series analysis. First, the spectra can be characterized by two distinct\nrelaxation lengths. This is a prerequisite for the validity of the\nsuperstatistical approach which is based on the folding of two distribution\nfunctions. Second, the shape of the resulting probability density function of\nthe so-called superstatistical parameter is reasonably approximated by an\ninverse chi-square distribution. This distribution is used to compute\nnearest-neighbor spacing distributions and compare them with those of the\nresonance frequencies of billiards with mixed dynamics within the framework of\nsuperstatistics. The obtained spacing distribution is found to present a good\ndescription of the experimental ones and is of the same or even better quality\nas a number of other spacing distributions, including the one from Berry and\nRobnik. However, in contrast to other approaches towards a theoretical\ndescription of spectral properties of systems with mixed dynamics,\nsuperstatistics also provides a description of properties of the\neigenfunctions. Indeed, the inverse chi-square parameter distribution is found\nsuitable for the analysis of experimental resonance strengths in the Limacon\nbilliards within the framework of superstatistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2008 11:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-05"}

Please see\n  arXiv:0806.0780","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"physics.plasm-ph","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  From a common expression for the poloidal electrostatic field of a tokamak,\nin the limit of large aspect ratio and concentric circular flux surfaces, one\nmay determine the associated potential. This potential satisfies Poisson's\nequation, which reduces to Laplace's equation when the medium has vanishing\ncharge density, in axial geometry but not toroidal geometry. A simple\ntransformation takes the potential over to the correct harmonic form for\ntokamak coordinates, and the resulting electrostatic field is calculated. From\nthe radial field one may estimate the supporting charge density on the\nboundary, and from the poloidal field one may determine a prediction for the\nradial dependence of the electron temperature, which does not compare well with\na rough estimate of the profile often seen in a tokamak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2008 15:48:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 May 2008 14:39:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2011 15:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-11"}
