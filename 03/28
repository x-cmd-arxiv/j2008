This field can drive inflation, and give a low energy universe in\nvery good agreement with the cosmological observations. The low energy dynamics\nof the Standard Model cannot be unitarized by the Higgsflaton, which decouples\nfrom the low energy theory, both because it picks up a large mass and because\nits direct couplings to the low energy modes are weakened.

A natural logical pursuit of this early work was to show that,\nin order to have a superconducting state evolved out of a pseudogap state, the\ndiamagnetic bosonic pair fluctuations (characterizing the pseudogap phase) have\nto be propagating modes, which are phase correlated over finite distances above\nTc. If so, then the pseudogap feature has to be reflected in characteristic\nfeatures of the single particle excitations, showing remnants of the Bogoliubov\nmodes inherent in the superconducting phase. Such Bogoliubov modes result from\ndynamical feedback effects between single electron excitations and dynamical\nlocal pairing fluctuations. We briefly recollect here our theoretical results\nand confront them with the recent experimental findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2008 18:47:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2008 14:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-28"}

We\nbegin with a comprehensive review of the integrability of the gauge theory\nspin-chain and that of the string sigma model. In the light of the AdS/CFT\nduality, they should be just two ways of describing the same underlying\nintegrability, and it is believed that the unified integrability can be\ncharacterised by a set of Bethe ansatz equations which is valid for all values\nof the 't Hooft coupling. By studying the asymptotic spectrum of the AdS/CFT in\nthe infinite spin/R-charge limit, we first identify the corresponding solitonic\ncounterparts in the context of the AdS/CFT, which are the so-called dyonic\ngiant magnons and the SYM magnon boundstates. Then we show that the S-matrix\ncomputed directly from the string solitons scattering precisely reproduces the\nprediction from the conjecture. We further perform an analyticity test by\nstudying the singularities of the conjectured magnon boundstate S-matrix and\nchecking the physicality conditions. These tests give strong positive supports\nfor the integrability of large-N AdS/CFT as well as the specific form of the\nconjectured Bethe ansatz equations. Concerning the string theory integrability,\nwe also provide a detailed study of certain classical string solutions on AdS_5\nx S^5.

Here we report the measurement of two\nindependent time delays in the quadruply imaged quasar WFI J2033-4723 (z =\n1.66). Our data consist of R-band images obtained with the Swiss 1.2 m EULER\ntelescope located at La Silla and with the 1.3 m SMARTS telescope located at\nCerro Tololo. The light curves have 218 independent epochs spanning 3 full\nyears of monitoring between March 2004 and May 2007, with a mean temporal\nsampling of one observation every 4th day. We measure the time delays using\nthree different techniques, and we obtain Dt(B-A) = 35.5 +- 1.4 days (3.8%) and\nDt(B-C) = 62.6 +4.1/-2.3 days (+6.5%/-3.7%), where A is a composite of the\nclose, merging image pair. After correcting for the time delays, we find R-band\nflux ratios of F_A/F_B = 2.88 +- 0.04, F_A/F_C = 3.38 +- 0.06, and F_A1/F_A2 =\n1.37 +- 0.05 with no evidence for microlensing variability over a time scale of\nthree years. However, these flux ratios do not agree with those measured in the\nquasar emission lines, suggesting that longer term microlensing is present. Our\nestimate of H0 agrees with the concordance value: non-parametric modeling of\nthe lensing galaxy predicts H0 = 67 +13/-10 km s-1 Mpc-1, while the Single\nIsothermal Sphere model yields H0 = 63 +7/-3 km s-1 Mpc-1 (68% confidence\nlevel). More complex lens models using a composite de Vaucouleurs plus NFW\ngalaxy mass profile show twisting of the mass isocontours in the lensing\ngalaxy, as do the non-parametric models. As all models also require a\nsignificant external shear, this suggests that the lens is a member of the\ngroup of galaxies seen in field of view of WFI J2033-4723.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2008 20:50:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2008 11:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

This paper studies PCA in this\nhigh-dimensional regime, but under the additional assumption that the maximal\neigenvector is sparse, say, with at most $k$ nonzero components. We consider a\nspiked covariance model in which a base matrix is perturbed by adding a\n$k$-sparse maximal eigenvector, and we analyze two computationally tractable\nmethods for recovering the support set of this maximal eigenvector, as follows:\n(a) a simple diagonal thresholding method, which transitions from success to\nfailure as a function of the rescaled sample size\n$\\theta_{\\mathrm{dia}}(n,p,k)=n/[k^2\\log(p-k)]$; and (b) a more sophisticated\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation, which succeeds once the rescaled\nsample size $\\theta_{\\mathrm{sdp}}(n,p,k)=n/[k\\log(p-k)]$ is larger than a\ncritical threshold. In addition, we prove that no method, including the best\nmethod which has exponential-time complexity, can succeed in recovering the\nsupport if the order parameter $\\theta_{\\mathrm{sdp}}(n,p,k)$ is below a\nthreshold.

We derive ages and metallicities\nusing stellar population models. We also derive dynamical masses and dynamical\nmass-to-light ratios by combining central velocity dispersions with global\nphotometry in B, R and K bands. Together, these data allow to reduce the\ndegeneracies between age, metallicity and star formation burst-strength that\nhave limited previous studies. We find old galaxies exhibit a mass-metallicity\nrelation with slope d[Fe/H]/dlogM = 0.25, while young galaxies show slopes\nconsistent with zero. When we account for the effects of the mass-metallicity\nrelation, we obtain a single, consistent relation between mass-to-light ratio\nand mass for old galaxies in all passbands. As we have accounted for stellar\npopulation effects, this relation must have a dynamical origin. However, we\ndemonstrate that any simple trend between mass-to-light-ratio and mass or\nluminosity is inconsistent with the observations, and that a more complex\nrelationship must exist. We find the central regions of galaxies often exhibit\nyoung stellar populations. However it is only in the lowest-mass galaxies\n(~10^{10} M$_{\\odot}$) that these populations are evident in the global\nphotometry. In higher-mass galaxies, young central populations have decreasing\ninfluence on the global photometry, with there being no discernible impact in\ngalaxies more massive than ~2x10^{11} M$_{\\odot}$. We conclude that the young\nstellar populations detected in spectroscopic studies are generally centrally\nconcentrated, and that there is an upper limit on the mass of star-forming\nevents in massive galaxies. These results have ramifications for mass-to-light\nratios estimated from photometric observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2008 00:31:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2008 03:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A variety of initial energy states are examined in this paper,\nranging from clouds with PE = 0.1 KE to clouds with PE = 10 KE, and for both\nisothermal and piece-wise polytropic equations of state (similar to that\nsuggested by Larson). It is found that arbitrary star formation efficiencies\nare possible, with strongly unbound clouds yielding very low star formation\nefficiencies. We suggest that the low star formation efficiency in the\nMaddelena cloud may be a consequence of the relatively unbound state of its\ninternal structure. It is also found that competitive accretion results in the\nobserved IMF when the clouds have initial energy states of PE >= KE. We show\nthat under such conditions the shape of the IMF is independent of time in the\ncalculations.

Recently, Gateva-Ivanova and Van den Bergh and\nEtingof, Schedler and Soloviev have shown a group theoretical interpretation of\ninvolutive non-degenerate solutions. Namely, there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between involutive non-degenerate solutions on finite sets and\ngroups of $I$-type. A group $\\mathcal{G}$ of $I$-type is a group isomorphic to\na subgroup of the natural semidirect product of $Fa_n$, the free abelian group\nof rank $n$, by $Sym_n$, the symmetric group on $n$ letters, so that the\nprojection onto $Fa_n$ is a bijective map. The projection of $\\mathcal{G}$ onto\n$Sym_n$ we call an involutive Yang-Baxter group (IYB group). This suggests the\nfollowing strategy to attack Drinfeld's problem for involutive non-degenerate\nset theoretic solutions. First classify the IYB groups and second, for a given\nIYB group $G$, classify the groups of $I$-type with $G$ as associated IYB\ngroup. It is known that every IYB group is solvable. In this paper some results\nsupporting the converse of this property are obtained. More precisely, we show\nthat some classes of groups are IYB groups. We also give a non-obvious method\nto construct infinitely many groups of $I$-type (and hence infinitely many\ninvolutive non-degenerate set theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation)\nwith a prescribed associated IYB group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2008 06:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-31"}

It is riddled with both misconceptions and\nerrors of fact. Purporting to cast doubt on the NAA (neutron activation\nanalysis) work conducted by Dr. Vincent Guinn in the investigation of the\nassassination of President John F. Kennedy, it fails miserably.

In addition, we have received letters, emails and telephone\ncalls. One of our favorites was a voicemail message asking us to return a call\nto Australia at which point we would learn who really killed JFK. We welcome\nthe opportunity to respond to the letter to the editor from Mr. Fiorentino. Mr.\nFiorentino claims that our ``statement relating to the likelihood of a second\nassassin based on the premise of three or more separate bullets is demonstrably\nfalse.'' In response we would like to simply quote from page 327 of Gerald\nPosner's book Case Closed, one of the most well known works supporting the\nsingle assassin theory: ``If Connally was hit by another bullet, it had to be\nfired from a second shooter, since the Warren Commission's own reconstructions\nshowed that Oswald could not have operated the bolt and refired in 1.4\nseconds.'' Mr. Fiorentino also claims that the ``second fatal flaw is the use\nof a rather uncomplicated formula based on Bayes Theorem.'' Let $E$ denote the\nevidence and $T$ denote the theory that there were just two bullets (and hence\na single shooter). We used Bayes Theorem to hypothetically calculate $P(T|E)$\nfrom $P(E|T)$ and the prior probability $P(T)$. In order to make $P(T|E)$ ten\ntimes more likely than $P(\\bar{T}|E)$, the ratio of the prior probabilities\n[i.e., $P(T) / P(\\bar{T})$] would have to be greater than 15. Thus, we again\nconclude that this casts serious doubt on Dr. Guinn's conclusion that the\nevidence supported just two bullets. Sadly, this is far from the first time\nthat probability has been misunderstood and/or misapplied in a case of public\ninterest. A notable British example is the Clark case. See Nobles and Schiff\n(2005) for details. Finally, we welcome and, in fact, encourage members of the\nscientific community to provide alternative analyses of the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2008 08:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

The obtained errors are in the\nrange between~11% and~29% which is consistent with typical error ranges\nobtained in previous studies.

We selected a complete sample of 50\nclusters in the X-ray band from the REFLEX (27) and the eBCS (23) catalogues.\nIn this paper we present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations at\n610 MHz for all clusters still lacking high sensitivity radio information, i.e.\n16 eBCS and 7 REFLEX clusters, thus completing the radio information for the\nwhole sample. The typical sensitivity in our images is in the range 1$\\sigma\n\\sim 35-100 \\mu$Jy b$^{-1}$. We found a radio halo in A697, a diffuse\nperipheral source of unclear nature in A781, a core--halo source in Z7160, a\ncandidate radio halo in A1682 and ``suspect'' central emission in Z2661.\nIncluding the literature information, a total of 10 clusters in the sample host\na radio halo. A very important result of our work is that 25 out of the 34\nclusters observed with the GMRT do not host extended central emission at the\nsensitivity level of our observations, and for 20 of them firm upper limits to\nthe radio power of a giant radio halo were derived. The GMRT Radio Halo Survey\nshows that radio halos are not common, and our findings on the fraction of\ngiant radio halos in massive clusters are consistent with the statistical\nexpectations based on the re--acceleration model. Our results favour primary to\nsecondary electron models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2008 11:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this paper,\nwe question this picture on the specific example of the directed polymer in a\ntwo dimensional random medium. We have recently shown (C. Monthus and T. Garel,\narxiv:0802.2502) that its dynamics for F=0 can be analyzed in terms of a strong\ndisorder renormalization procedure, where the distribution of renormalized\nbarriers flows towards some \"infinite disorder fixed point\". In the present\npaper, we obtain that for small $F$, this \"infinite disorder fixed point\"\nbecomes a \"strong disorder fixed point\" with an exponential distribution of\nrenormalized barriers. The corresponding distribution of trapping times then\nonly decays as a power-law $P(\\tau) \\sim 1/\\tau^{1+\\alpha}$, where the exponent\n$\\alpha(F,T)$ vanishes as $\\alpha(F,T) \\propto F^{\\mu}$ as $F \\to 0$. Our\nconclusion is that in the small force region $\\alpha(F,T)<1$, the divergence of\nthe averaged trapping time $\\bar{\\tau}=+\\infty$ induces strong\nnon-self-averaging effects that invalidate the usual creep formula obtained by\nreplacing all trapping times by the typical value.

This analysis is confirmed by numerical\nsimulations of a directed polymer with a metric constraint driven in a traps\nlandscape.

The width\nnarrowing of coherence revival as a function of increasing kick number and\nstrength provides a new accurate measurement of the recoil frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2008 15:48:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2008 15:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-09"}

The model\nincludes Coulomb correlations in the central dot, while such correlations in\nthe two side-coupled dots are omitted. The infinite-U mean-field slave-boson\napproach is used to obtain basic transport characteristics in the Kondo regime.\nWhen tuning position of the side-coupled dots' levels, transition from\nsubradiant to superradiant like mode (and vice versa) has been found in the\nspectral function, in analogy to the Dicke effect in atomic physics. Bias\ndependence of the differential conductance and zero frequency shot noise is\nalso analysed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2008 15:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
