The SU(5) GUTs are\nformulated on two five-dimensional throats in the flat limit and the neutrino\nmasses become small due to the type-I seesaw mechanism. The discrete\nnon-Abelian flavor symmetries are given by semi-direct products of cyclic\ngroups that are broken at the infrared branes at the tip of the throats. As a\nresult, we obtain SU(5) GUTs that provide a combined description of non-Abelian\nflavor symmetries and quark-lepton complementarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2008 16:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2008 14:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The magnitude of\nthe correlations depends on the applied magnetic field, and the magnitude first\ndecreases and then increases with increasing magnetic field. Minimal\ncorrelations and maximal rotation angles are observed at the same magnetic\nfields. The width of the correlation function is directly proportional to the\nexcited state lifetime and inversely proportional to the Rabi frequency of\nlaser field. These results can be useful for improving optical magnetometers\nand for optical field or atomic spin squeezing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2008 18:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-24"}

The more massive\nclouds are associated with a greater number of outflows, which suggests that\nthe star formation efficiency is roughly the same in each region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2008 20:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Naturally,\nthese play an important role in quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum\ninformation theory. However, a general distillation method has heretofore been\nmissing. Inspired by Koashi's complementary control scenario (arXiv:0704.3661v1\n[quant-ph]), we give a new definition of private states in terms of one party's\npotential knowledge of two complementary measurements made on the other and use\nthis to construct a general method of private state distillation using quantum\nerror-correcting codes. The procedure achieves the same key rate as recent,\nmore information-theoretic approaches while demonstrating the physical\nprinciples underlying privacy of the key.

It is quantified as the local\nderivative of the logarithm of the dispersion of a given observable (within a\nset of different simulations differing weakly through their initial\nrealization), with respect to the cosmic growth factor. In an Eulerian\nframework, it is shown here that chaos appears at small scales, where dynamic\nis non-linear, while it vanishes at larger scales, allowing the computation of\na critical transition scale corresponding to ~ 3.5 Mpc/h. This picture is\nconfirmed by Lagrangian measurements which show that the distribution of\nsubstructures within clusters is partially sensitive to initial conditions,\nwith a critical mass upper bound scaling roughly like the perturbation's\namplitude to the power 0.15. The corresponding characteristic mass, $M_{\\rm\ncrit}=2 10^{13} M_{\\odot}$, is roughly of the order of the critical mass of non\nlinearities at z=1 and accounts for the decoupling induced by the dark energy\ntriggered acceleration. The sensitivity to detailed initial conditions spills\nto some of the overall physical properties of the host halo (spin and velocity\ndispersion tensor orientation) while other \"global\" properties are quite robust\nand show no chaos (mass, spin parameter, connexity and center of mass\nposition). This apparent discrepancy may reflect the fact that quantities which\nare integrals over particles rapidly average out details of difference in\norbits, while the other observables are more sensitive to the detailed\nenvironment of forming halos and reflect the non-linear scale coupling\ncharacterizing the environments of halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2008 07:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The method we follow uses\nthe WKB analytic expansion and point-splitting regularization, similarly to\nprevious calculations in the asymptotically flat case. Following standard\nprocedures, we write the Green function, regularize the initial divergent\nexpression by point-splitting, renormalize it by subtracting geometrical\ncounter-terms, and take the coincidence limit in the end. After explicitly\ndemonstrating the cancellation of the divergences and the regularity of the\nGreen function, we express the result as a sum of two parts. One is calculated\nanalytically and the result expressed in terms of some generalized\nzeta-functions, which appear in the computation of functional determinants of\nLaplacians on Riemann spheres. We also describe some systematic methods to\nevaluate these functions numerically. Interestingly, the WKB approximation\nnaturally organizes $<\\phi^2>$ as a series in such zeta-functions. We\ndemonstrate this explicitly up to next-to-leading order in the WKB expansion.\nThe other term represents the `remainder' of the WKB approximation and depends\non the difference between an exact (numerical) expression and its WKB\ncounterpart. This has to be dealt with by means of numerical approximation. The\ngeneral results are specialized to the case of Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter\nblack hole geometries.

The system displays a delocalized (superfluid) phase\nat small values of the intensity of the secondary lattice V2 and a localized\n(Bose glass-like) phase at larger intensity V2. We analyze the localization\ntransition as a function of the height V2 beyond the known limits of free and\nhard-core bosons. We find that weak repulsive interactions unfavor the\nlocalized phase i. e. they increase the critical value of V2 at which\nlocalization occurs. In the case of integer filling of the primary lattice, the\nphase diagram at fixed density displays, in addition to a transition from a\nsuperfluid to a Bose glass phase, a transition to a Mott-insulating state for\nnot too large V2 and large repulsion. We also analyze the emergence of a\nBose-glass phase by looking at the evolution of the Mott-insulator lobes when\nincreasing V2. The Mott lobes shrink and disappear above a critical value of\nV2. Finally, we characterize the superfluid phase by the momentum distribution,\nand show that it displays a power-law decay at small momenta typical of\nLuttinger liquids, with an exponent depending on the combined effect of the\ninteractions and of the secondary lattice. In addition, we observe two side\npeaks which are due to the diffraction of the Bose gas by the second lattice.\nThis latter feature could be observed in current experiments as characteristics\nof pseudo-random Bose systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2008 09:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-22"}

We consider in detail the case when both $LH_u$\nand $H_uH_d$ flat directions are operative with a non-renormalizable\nsuperpotential. In case Hubble induced A-terms are present for these two flat\ndirections, their initial values are determined completely by the potential and\nthere are no ambiguities how they are mixed. Moreover, CP is violated even when\nthe Hubble parameter is large due to the Hubble induced A-term and cross\ncoupling in F-term, so that the lepton asymmetry is generated just after the\nend of inflation. As a result, compared with the case of single flat direction,\nthe resultant lepton-to-entropy ratio is enhanced by a factor of\n$H_{osc}/m_{3/2}$, where $H_{osc}$ is the Hubble parameter at the onset of\noscillation and $m_{3/2}$ is the gravitino mass. However, when Hubble induced\nA-terms do not exist, there remains indefiniteness of initial phases and CP is\nviolated spontaneously by the phase difference between initial phase and\npotential minima of the hidden-sector induced A-terms. Therefore, CP-violation\nis not effective until the onset of the oscillation of scalar fields around the\norigin and there is suppression factor from thermal effect as is the case of\nsingle flat direction.

The dephasing between this best-fit\nEOB waveform and published Caltech-Cornell inspiral data is found to vary\nbetween -0.0014 and +0.0008 radians over a time span of $\\sim 2464M$ up to\ngravitational wave frequency $M\\omega= 0.1$, and between +0.0013 and -0.0185\nover a time span of 96M after $M\\omega=0.1$ up to $M\\omega=0.1565$. The\ndephasings between EOB and the new coalescence data are found to be smaller\nthan: (i) $\\pm 0.025$ radians over a time span of 730M (11 cycles) up to\nmerger, in the equal mass case, and (ii) $\\pm 0.05$ radians over a time span of\nabout 950M (17 cycles) up to merger in the 2:1 mass-ratio case. These new\nresults corroborate the aptitude of the EOB formalism to provide accurate\nrepresentations of general relativistic waveforms, which are needed by\ncurrently operating gravitational wave detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2008 13:17:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2008 09:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Redshift\ninformation is insufficient to determine whether a CG is roughly as dense in 3D\nas it appears in projection, or whether it is caused by a chance alignment (CA)\nalong the line of sight within a larger galaxy system. Recent precise distance\nmeasurements help probe the nature of the nearest CG, situated in the Virgo\ncluster, whose dominant member is M60. The isolated status of the CG is\nreassessed with recent photometry and a statistical analysis is performed on\nthe surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances measured by Mei et al. in\nVirgo, for 4 of the 5 CG members. The neighboring galaxy NGC 4606 appears (with\n80-90% confidence) to be too faint to affect the isolated status of the CG.\nTaken at face value, the SBF distances suggest that M59 and NGC 4660 lie\nroughly 2 Mpc to the foreground of M60, NGC 4638, and the bulk of the Virgo\ncluster. The statistical analysis confirms that the CG is, indeed, the result\nof a CA of its galaxies, with NGC 4638 lying at least 800 kpc further away\n(with 99% confidence) than either M59 or NGC 4660. The first two galaxy\ndistances are consistent with M59 and NGC 4660 constituting a tight pair.

Aims. We study the I(15.01\nA)/I(16.78 A) intensity ratio for the active cool dwarf EV Lac, in both flare\nand quiescent spectra. Methods. The observations were obtained with the\nReflection Grating Spectrometer on the XMM-Newton satellite. The emission\nmeasure distribution versus temperature reconstruction technique is used for\nour analysis. Results. We find that the 15.01 A line exhibits a significant\nenhancement in intensity over the optically thin value. To our knowledge, this\nis the first time that such an enhancement has been detected on such a sound\nstatistical basis. We interpret this enhancement in terms of a geometry in\nwhich the emitters and absorbers are not spatially distinct, and where the\ngeometry is such that resonant pumping of the upper level has a greater effect\non the observed line intensity than resonant absorption in the line-of-sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2008 15:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It imposes a non\ntrivial gap closing condition under the gauge twist in both finite- and\ninfinite-size systems. It also implies a necessary condition for the gapped and\nunique ground state. As for the simplest case, it predicts an inevitable gap\nclosing in the Heisenberg chain of half integer spins. Its relation to the\nLieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem is discussed based on the symmetries of the twisted\nHamiltonian. The discussion is also extended to the (approximately) degenerated\nmultiplet and fermion cases. It restricts the number of the states in the low\nenergy cluster of the spectrum by the filling of the fermions. Constraints by\nthe reflection symmetry are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2008 15:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-23"}
