We study the\nprobabilities associated with these lens searches, namely the probability of\nidentifying a candidate with rogue [OII] emission lines in a galaxy's spectrum,\nand the probability that the candidate will show features of strong lensing in\nfollow-up photometric observations. We include selection effects unique to\nspectroscopic data, and apply them to the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey (Bolton\net al. 2006). The most significant selection effect is the finite size of the\nspectroscopic fiber which selects against large separation lenses and results\nin a non-monotonic dependence of the rogue line probability on velocity\ndispersion. For example, with the 3 arcsec diameter SDSS fiber and 2 arcsec\nFWHM seeing, we find that the probability that a given LRG has a rogue [OII]\nline in its spectrum decreases with velocity dispersion from 150 km/s to 300\nkm/s and then increases up to 400 km/s for a given source size. The total\nprobability for observing a rogue line in a single survey spectrum is\n~0.9-3.0%, and the total lensing rate is ~0.5-1.3%. The range is due to\nuncertainties in the physical size of [OII] emission regions, and in the\nevolution of the [OII] luminosity function. Our estimates are a factor of ~5\nhigher than the results of the SLACS survey, a discrepancy which we attribute\nto the SLACS requirement that multiple rogue lines be observed simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2008 18:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

One important motivation for privatization is to help\ndevelop factor and product markets, as well as security markets. Progress in\nprivatization is correlated with improvements in perceived political and\ninvestment risk. Many emerging countries have gradually reduced their political\nrisks during the course of sustained privatization. In fact, most risk\nresolution seems to take place as privatization proceeds to its later stage.\nAlternative benefits of privatization are improved risk sharing and increased\nliquidity and activity of the market. One of the main methods to develop\nprivatization is entering a new stock to the markets for arising competition.\nHowever, attention to the capability of the markets to accept a new stock is\nsubstantial. Without considering the above statement, it is possible to reduce\nthe market's efficiency. In other words, introduction of a new stock to the\nmarket usually decreases the stage of development and activity and increases\nthe risk. Based on complexity theory, we quantify how the following factors:\nstage of development, activity, risk and investment horizons play roles in the\nprivatization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2008 19:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

In this picture, the current splits into a pair of massless partons,\nwhich then evolve via successive branchings, in such a way that energy is\nquasi-democratically divided among the products of a branching. We point out a\nduality between the transverse size of the partonic system produced through\nbranching and the radial distance traveled by the dual Maxwell wave in the AdS\ngeometry. For a time-like current, the branching occurs already in the vacuum,\nwhere it gives rise to a system of low-momentum partons isotropically\ndistributed in the transverse plane. But at finite temperature, the branching\nmechanism is modified by the medium, in that the rate for parton splitting is\nenhanced by the transfer of transverse momentum from the partons to the plasma.\nThis mechanism, which controls the parton energy loss, is sensitive to the\nenergy density in the plasma, but not to the details of the thermal state. We\ncompute the lifetime of the current for various kinematical regimes and provide\nphysical interpretations for other, related, quantities, so like the meson\nscreening length, the drag force, or the trailing string, that were previously\ncomputed via AdS/CFT techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2008 18:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-10"}

We denote by $\\Omega$ the set of paths $w$\ntaking values on S (the elements $w$ are locally constant with left and right\nlimits and are also right continuous on $t$). We consider an infinitesimal\ngenerator $L$ and a stationary vector $p_0$. We denote by $P$ the associated\nprobability on ($\\Omega, {\\cal B}$). This is the a priori probability. All\nfunctions $f$ we consider bellow are in the set ${\\cal L}^\\infty (P)$. From the\nprobability $P$ we define a Ruelle operator ${\\cal L}^t, t\\geq 0$, acting on\nfunctions $f:\\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ of ${\\cal L}^\\infty (P)$. Given $V:\\Omega\n\\to \\mathbb{R}$, such that is constant in sets of the form $\\{X_0=c\\}$, we\ndefine a modified Ruelle operator $\\tilde{{\\cal L}}_V^t, t\\geq 0$. We are able\nto show the existence of an eigenfunction $u$ and an eigen-probability $\\nu_V$\non $\\Omega$ associated to $\\tilde{{\\cal L}}^t_V, t\\geq 0$.

Meanwhile Paul Bellan has\nproduced a theoretical model in which an initially empty, twisted force-free\nloop, on being filled with plasma via upflow at each foot point, in the absence\nof significant gravitational effects, forms a narrow, filamentary loop of\nconstant cross-section. In this paper, we focus on equilibrium states that\ninclude stratification by uniform gravity while retaining the effects of\nmagnetic field twist. Comparing these with related force-free equilibria, it is\nfound that injection of low-$\\beta $ plasma under coronal conditions is not\nlikely to change the shape of a loop significantly. These linear equilibria\napply to the interiors and boundaries of loops only, with external influences\nmodeled by boundary total pressures. The effects of total pressure balance with\nsurroundings and of gravitational stratification are to inhibit the pinching of\na loop to a constant cross-section. Only if the plasma $\\beta$ were high enough\nfor the plasma to reconfigure the external field and the hydrostatic scale\nheight much greater than the loop size could the final state have nearly\nconstant cross section. We do not expect this to occur in the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2008 19:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-18"}

The\ngeneral asymmetric rigid rotor Hamiltonian is thus an exactly solvable model.\nThis fact has important implications for the structure of the spectrum, as well\nas for the eigenstates and correlation functions of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2008 02:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-19"}

Some of the intensity\nsubstructure in the jets is clearly related to structure in their apparent\nmagnetic field: there are arcs of emission where the degree of linear\npolarization increases, with the apparent magnetic field parallel to the ridges\nof the arcs. The spectral indices are significantly steeper (0.62) within 7\narcsec of the nucleus than between 7 and 50 arcsec (0.52 - 0.57). The spectra\nof the jet edges are also slightly flatter than the average for their\nsurroundings.

On the one hand we\nshow that they are very localized in real space, taking place outside the\npatches of relative order, and from the other point of view we show that they\nrepresent transitions from one local minimum in the potential surface to\nanother. This picture offers a direct relation between structure and dynamics,\nascribing the slowing down in glass forming systems to the reduction in\nrelative volume of the amorphous material which is liquid-like. While we agree\nwith the well known Adam-Gibbs proposition that the slowing down is due to an\nentropic squeeze (a dramatic decrease in the number of available\nconfigurations), we do not agree with the Adam-Gibbs (or the Volger-Fulcher)\nformulae that predict an infinite relaxation time at a finite temperature.\nRather, we propose that generically there should be no singular crisis at any\nfinite temperature: the relaxation time and the associated correlation length\n(average cluster size) increase at most super-exponentially when the\ntemperature is lowered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2008 11:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We conduct a quantitative\ncomparison of the resolved stellar populations in these fields and identify\nseveral striking trends. The color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), which reach ~3\nmagnitudes below the red clump, can be classified into two main categories\nbased on their morphologies. `Stream-like' fields, so named for their\nsimilarity to the CMD of the giant stellar stream, are characterized by a red\nclump that slants bluewards at fainter magnitudes and an extended horizontal\nbranch. On the other hand, `disk-like' fields exhibit rounder red clumps with\nsignificant luminosity width, lack an obvious horizontal branch and show\nevidence for recent star formation (~0.25 - 2.0 Gyr ago). We compare the\nspatial and line-of-sight distribution of stream-like fields with a recent\nsimulation of the giant stream progenitor orbit and find an excellent\nagreement. These fields, found across the face of M31, attest to the high\ndegree of pollution caused by this event. Disk-like material resides in the\nextended disk structure of M31 and is detected out to 44 kpc (projected); the\nuniform populations in these fields, including the ubiquitous presence of young\npopulations, and the strong rotation reported elsewhere are most consistent\nwith a scenario in which this structure has formed through heating and\ndisruption of the existing thin disk, perhaps due to the impact of the giant\nstream progenitor.

Third, a fast iterative backward-forward splitting algorithm is\nproposed to solve the minimization problem. We derive existence and uniqueness\nconditions of the solution, and establish convergence of the iterative\nalgorithm. Finally, a GCV-based model selection procedure is proposed to\nobjectively select the regularization parameter. Experimental results are\ncarried out to show the striking benefits gained from taking into account the\nPoisson statistics of the noise. These results also suggest that using\nsparse-domain regularization may be tractable in many deconvolution\napplications with Poisson noise such as astronomy and microscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2008 13:13:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2008 13:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We extend our previous\nsimulations that involved pure stellar discs without gas, to deal with the\neffects of gas dissipation and star formation. We also vary the interpolating\nfunction between the MOND and Newtonian regime. Bar formation is compared in\nboth dynamics, from initial conditions identical in visible component. One\nfirst result is that the MOND galaxy evolution is not affected by the choice of\nthe mu-function, it develops bars with the same frequency and strength. The\nchoice of the mu-function significantly changes the equivalent DM models, in\nchanging the dark matter to visible mass ratio and, therefore, changing the\nstability. The introduction of gas shortens the timescale for bar formation in\nthe DM model, but is not significantly shortened in the MOND model. As a\nconsequence, with gas, the MOND and DM bar frequency histograms are now more\nsimilar than without gas. The thickening of the plane occurs through vertical\nresonance with the bar and peanut formation, and even more quickly with gas.\nSince the mass gets more concentrated with gas, the radius of the peanut is\nsmaller, and the appearance of the pseudo-bulge is more boxy. The bar strength\ndifference is moderated by saturation, and feedback effects, like the bar\nweakening or destruction by gas inflow due to gravity torques. Averaged over a\nseries of models representing the Hubble sequence, the MOND models have still\nmore bars, and stronger bars, than the equivalent DM models, better fitting the\nobservations. Gas inflows driven by bars produce accumulations at Lindblad\nresonances, and MOND models can reproduce observed morphologies quite well, as\nwas found before in the Newtonian dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2008 13:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Another important\nquestion is what keeps them inside the hadron, which is known to have\nspace-time extension. Since they are relativistic objects, how would the hadron\nappear to observers in different Lorentz frames? The hadron moving with speed\nclose to that of light appears as a collection of Feynman's partons. In other\nwords, the same object looks differently to observers in two different frames,\nas Einstein's energy-momentum relation takes different forms for those\nobservers. In order to explain this, it is necessary to construct a quantum\nbound-state picture valid in all Lorentz frames. It is noted that Paul A.

It must occur\nalong a fully invariant surface. The obvious surface available for this purpose\nis that of the backward time cone of the collapse event as proposed by Hellwig\nand Kraus. This collapse is widely believed to result in paradoxical causal\nloops that cannot be removed by special relativistic or standard quantum\nmechanical considerations alone. However, the paradox is resolved when we apply\nthe qRule foundation theory that is developed in the other paper. The causal\nand temporal orders of state reduction are then found to be in agreement with\none another, and the resulting boundaries in Minkowski space are shown to have\na novel architecture that limits the range of a Hellwig-Kraus reduction in\nspace and time. Although these boundaries have been worked out using the\nqRules, they should be the same for any foundation theory that treats the\ncollapse of a wave in an invariant way, and requires that a collapse destroys\nthe possibility of any further influence on itself, as do the qRules.\n  Keywords: measurement, state reduction, wave collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2008 14:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-19"}

The authors extend classical methods for analyzing\nthe homology of certain spaces $Q(X)$ with mod-$p$ coefficients to describe the\nhomology $\\HH_{\\bullet}(\\Sigma_d, V^{\\otimes d})$ as a module for the general\nlinear group $GL(V)$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic\n$p$.

In particular we\nanalyze the effects of a finite environment temperature on the cooling\nefficiency, and find minimal temperature and optimized cooling rate in the\nstrong drive regime. Further we discuss the trade-off between efficiency of\ncavity cooling and robustness with respect to ubiquitous imperfections in a\nrealistic experimental setup, such as anharmonicity of the trapping potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2008 15:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-21"}
