Using anholonomic\ncoordinates allows to find out relative speed of two observers and appropriate\nLorentz transformation. Synchronization of a reference frame is an anholonomic\ntime coordinate. Simple calculations show how synchronization influences time\nmeasurement in the vicinity of the Earth. Measurement of Doppler shift from the\nstar orbiting the black hole helps to determine mass of the black hole.\n  We call a manifold with torsion and nonmetricity the metric\\hyph affine\nmanifold.

The theory dramatically simplifies in this limit, because the\ncorrelation functions of all, not only topological (or BPS), observables may be\ncomputed explicitly in terms of integrals over finite-dimensional moduli spaces\nof instanton configurations. In Part I (arXiv:hep-th/0610149) we discussed in\ndetail the one-dimensional (that is, quantum mechanical) models of this type.\nHere we analyze the supersymmetric two-dimensional sigma models and\nfour-dimensional Yang--Mills theory, using the one-dimensional models as a\nprototype. We go beyond the topological (or BPS) sectors of these models and\nconsider them as full-fledged quantum field theories. We study in detail the\nspace of states and find that the Hamiltonian is not diagonalizable, but has\nJordan blocks. This leads to the appearance of logarithms in the correlation\nfunctions. We find that our theories are in fact logarithmic conformal field\ntheories (theories of this type are of interest in condensed matter physics).\nWe define jet-evaluation observables and consider in detail their correlation\nfunctions. They are given by integrals over the moduli spaces of holomorphic\nmaps, which generalize the Gromov--Witten invariants. These integrals generally\ndiverge and require regularization, leading to an intricate logarithmic mixing\nof the operators of the sigma model. A similar structure arises in the\nfour-dimensional Yang--Mills theory as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Mar 2008 04:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-28"}
