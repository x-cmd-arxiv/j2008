If the unparticle couplings\nto the neutrinos are mildly non-universal, such long-range forces will not\nfactorize out in the neutrino flavour evolution. As a consequence large\ndeviations from the observed standard matter-induced oscillation pattern for\nsolar neutrinos would be generated. In this case, severe limits can be set on\nthe infrared fix point scale, Lambda_u, and the new physics scale, M, as a\nfunction of the ultraviolet (d_UV) and anomalous (d) dimension of the\nunparticle operator. For a scalar unparticle, for instance, assuming the\nnon-universality of the lepton couplings to unparticles to be of the order of a\nfew per mil we find that, for d_UV=3 and d=1.1, M is constrained to be M >\nO(10^9) TeV (M > O(10^10) TeV) if Lambda_u= 1 TeV (10 TeV). For given values of\nLambda_u and d, the corresponding bounds on M for vector [tensor] unparticles\nare approximately 100 [3/Sqrt(Lambda_u/TeV)] times those for the scalar case.\nConversely, these results can be translated into severe constraints on\nuniversality violation of the fermion couplings to unparticle operators with\nscales which can be accessible at future colliders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2008 18:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2008 16:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In the case of unscreened interactions with a long range\n1/x tail there is a crossover from a liquid to a quasi Wigner crystal state as\nthe density decreases. When this interaction is screened, quasi long range\norder is prevented from forming, although a significant correlation with 4 k_F\nperiodicity is still present at low densities. At even lower electron\nconcentration, exchange is suppressed and the spin-dependent interactions\nbecome negligible, making the electrons behave like spinless fermions. We show\nthat this behavior is shared by the long range and screened interactions by\nstudying the spin and charge excitations of the system in both cases. Finally,\nwe study the effect of electron correlations in the double quantum wire\nexperiment [Steinberg et al., Phys. Rev.

In general,\nthere is no reason why only one of these - the one corresponding to weak\nhypercharge - should be massless. Observations require that standard model\nparticles must be neutral (or have an extremely small charge) under additional\nmassless U(1)s, i.e. the latter have to belong to a so called hidden sector.\nThe exchange of heavy messengers, however, can lead to a kinetic mixing between\nthe hypercharge and the hidden-sector U(1)s, that is testable with near future\nexperiments. This provides a powerful probe of the hidden sectors and, as a\nconsequence, of the string theory realisation itself. In the present paper, we\nshow, using a variety of methods, how the kinetic mixing can be derived from\nthe underlying type II string compactification, involving supersymmetric and\nnonsupersymmetric configurations of D-branes, both in large volumes and in\nwarped backgrounds with fluxes. We first demonstrate by explicit example that\nkinetic mixing occurs in a completely supersymmetric set-up where we can use\nconformal field theory techniques. We then develop a supergravity approach\nwhich allows us to examine the phenomenon in more general backgrounds, where we\nfind that kinetic mixing is natural in the context of flux compactifications.\nWe discuss the phenomenological consequences for experiments at the low-energy\nfrontier, searching for signatures of light, sub-electronvolt or even massless\nhidden-sector U(1) gauge bosons and minicharged particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2008 16:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-18"}

We argue that the small\nangle singularities of energy correlation functions are controlled by the twist\nof non-local light-ray operators with a definite spin. We relate the charge two\npoint function to a particular moment of the parton distribution functions\nappearing in deep inelastic scattering. The one point energy correlation\nfunctions are characterized by a few numbers. For ${\\cal N}=1$ superconformal\ntheories the one point function for states created by the R-current or the\nstress tensor are determined by the two parameters $a$ and $c$ characterizing\nthe conformal anomaly.

The\nprescription amounts to probing the falling string state as it crosses the\n$AdS$ horizon with gravitational shock waves. In the leading, two derivative,\ngravity approximation the energy is uniformly distributed on the sphere at\ninfinity, with no fluctuations.

The average SFR in the most massive objects at\nthis redshift is 100-500 Msun/yr. At z~3, the SFR starts to drop at the high\nmass end. As z decreases further, the SFR drops at progressively lower masses\n(downsizing), dropping most rapidly for high mass (logM>11) galaxies. The mass\nat which the SFR starts to deviate from the power-law form (break mass)\nprogresses smoothly from logM~13 at z~5 to logM~10.9 at z~0.5.

The SFR observed in high mass galaxies at\nz~4 is sufficient to explain their rapid increase in number density.

This puts a limit on\nthe maximum storable current and, as a consequence, on the achievable peak and\nintegrated luminosity. In order to mitigate the problem, numerical and\nexperimental studies of the parasitic crossings compensation by\ncurrent-carrying wires have been done. During the operation for the KLOE\nexperiment two such wires have been installed at both ends of the interaction\nregion. They produced a relevant improvement in the lifetime of the weak beam\n(positrons) at the maximum current of the strong one (electrons) without\nluminosity loss, in agreement with the numerical predictions. The same\ncompensating mechanism has been adopted during the run for the FINUDA\nexperiment as well, with less evident benefits than in the previous case. The\ninterplay between nonlinearities originating from the beam-beam interaction and\nthe ring lattice has been studied by theoretical simulation and experimental\nmeasurements. Compensation procedures have been set up relying on the\nelectromagnetic octupoles installed on both rings and used in addition to wire\ncompensation.\n  In this paper the parasitic crossings effects in the DAFNE interaction\nregions and their compensation by wires and octupoles are described. A detailed\ntheoretical analysis of the interplay about different non-linearities is\npresented; eventually experimental measurements and observations are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2008 09:47:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2008 10:11:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2008 16:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-08"}

We identified different universality classes and computed the critical\nexponents and universal amplitudes describing geometric and velocity-force\ncharacteristics. In contrast to uncorrelated disorder, the statistical tilt\nsymmetry is broken resulting in a nontrivial response to a transverse tilting\nforce. For instance, the vortex lattice in disordered superconductors shows a\nnew glass phase whose properties interpolate between those of the Bragg and\nBose glasses formed by pointlike and columnar disorder, respectively. Whereas\nthere is no response in the Bose glass phase (transverse Meissner effect), the\nstandard linear response expected in the Bragg-glass gets modified to a power\nlaw response in the presence of disorder correlations. We also studied the long\ndistance properties of the O(N) spin system with random fields and random\nanisotropies correlated as 1/x^{d-sigma}. Using FRG we obtained the phase\ndiagram in (d,sigma,N)-parameter space and computed the corresponding critical\nexponents. We found that below the lower critical dimension 4+sigma, there can\nexist two different types of quasi-long-range-order with zero order-parameter\nbut infinite correlation length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2008 13:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

For this purpose, we consider a system composed of N peers becoming\nactive at exponential random times; the system is initiated with only one\nserver offering the desired file and the other peers after becoming active try\nto download it. Once the file has been downloaded by a peer, this one\nimmediately becomes a server. To investigate the transient behavior of this\nfile sharing system, we study the instant when the system shifts from a\ncongested state where all servers available are saturated by incoming demands\nto a state where a growing number of servers are idle. In spite of its apparent\nsimplicity, this queueing model (with a random number of servers) turns out to\nbe quite difficult to analyze. A formulation in terms of an urn and ball model\nis proposed and corresponding scaling results are derived. These asymptotic\nresults are then compared against simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2008 15:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Our most important objectives are to make a census of associated\nsubmillimeter galaxies (SMGs), check their properties, and look for a possible\noverdensity in the protocluster J2142-4426 at z=2.38.\n  We used the newly commissioned Large APEX Bolometer Camera (LABoCa) on the\nAtacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope, in its Science Verification\nphase, to carry out a deep 10'x10' map at 870 micron, and we performed multiple\nchecks of the quality of data processing and source extraction.\n  Our map, the first published deep image, confirms the capabilities of\nAPEX/LABoCa as the most efficient current equipment for wide and deep submm\nmapping. Twenty-two sources were securely extracted with 870 micron flux\ndensities in the range 3-21 mJy, rms noise 0.8-2.4 mJy, and far-IR luminosities\nprobably in the range ~5-20 x 10(12) Lo. Only one of the four 50 kpc-extended\nLya blobs has a secure 870 micron counterpart. The 870 micron source counts in\nthe whole area are marginally higher than in the SHADES SCUBA survey, with a\npossible over-density around this blob. The majority of the 3.6-24 micron SEDs\nof the submillimeter sources indicate they are starburst dominated, with\nredshifts mostly >2. However, there is evidence of a high-z AGN in ~30% of the\nsources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2008 15:51:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2008 11:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
