A\nsource coincident with the SN 2008S position is clearly detected in the 4.5,\n5.8, and 8.0 micron IRAC bands, showing no evident variability in the three\nyears prior to the explosion, yet is undetected at 3.6 and 24 micron. The\ndistinct presence of ~440 K dust, along with stringent LBT limits on the\noptical fluxes, suggests that the progenitor of SN 2008S was engulfed in a\nshroud of its own dust.

We find that 1) GC mass\nfractions can be high in both giants and dwarfs, but are universally low in\ngalaxies with intermediate luminosities. 2) The behavior of specific frequency\nacross galaxy mass is dominated by the blue GCs. 3) The GC fractions of\nlow-mass galaxies exhibit a dependence on environment. Nearly all dwarf\ngalaxies with high GC fractions are within 1 Mpc of the cD galaxy M87,\npresenting the first strong evidence that GC formation in dwarfs is biased\ntoward dense environments. 4) GC formation in central dwarfs is biased because\ntheir stars form earliest and most intensely. Comparisons to the Millennium\nSimulation show that central dwarfs have older stellar populations and form\nmore stars at higher star formation rates (SFRs) and SFR surface densities. The\nSFR surface density in simulated dwarfs peaks before the total SFR, naturally\nproducing GC populations that are older and more metal-poor than the field\nstars. 5) Dwarfs within ~40 kpc of the giant ellipticals M87 and M49 are red\nand have few or no GCs, suggesting that they have been tidally stripped and\nhave contributed their GCs to the halos of their giant neighbors. The central\ndwarfs with high GC mass fractions are thus likely to be the survivors most\nsimilar to the protogalaxies that assembled the rich M87 globular cluster\nsystem.(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2008 17:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This\nhas recently been challenged by direct observations of the low/hard state disc\nfrom CCD data. We reanalyze the Swift and RXTE campaign covering the 2006\noutburst of XTE J1817-330 and show that these data actually strongly support\nthe truncated disc model as the transition spectra unambiguously show that the\ndisc begins to recede as the source leaves the disc dominated soft state. The\ndisc radius inferred for the proper low/hard state is less clear-cut, but we\nshow that the effect of irradiation from the energetically dominant hot plasma\nleads to an underestimate of the disc radius by a factor of 2-3 in this state.\nThis may also produce the soft excess reported in some hard-state spectra. The\ninferred radius becomes still larger when the potential difference in stress at\nthe inner boundary, increased colour temperature correction from incomplete\nthermalization of the irradiation, and loss of observable disc photons from\nComptonization in the hot plasma are taken into account. We conclude that the\ninner disc radius in XTE J1817-330 in the low/hard spectral state is at least\n6-8 times that seen in the disc dominated high/soft state, and that recession\nof the inner disc is the trigger for the soft--hard state transition, as\npredicted by the truncated disc models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2008 16:55:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 May 2008 14:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We present a Yukawa-unified SO(10) SUSY GUT scenario which\navoids the gravitino problem, gives rise to the correct matter-antimatter\nasymmetry via non-thermal leptogenesis, and is consistent with the\nWMAP-measured abundance of cold dark matter due to the presence of an axino\nLSP. To maintain a consistent cosmology for Yukawa-unified SUSY models, we\nrequire a re-heat temperature T_R\\sim 10^6-10^7 GeV, an axino mass around \\sim\n0.1-10 MeV, and a PQ breaking scale f_a\\sim 10^{12} GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2008 18:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2008 17:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

High-resolution\noptical UBVRI and Halpha images, near-infrared JHKs and H2 filter images were\nused to make photometric and morphological studies of the point sources and the\nnebula seen towards Sh2-294. The optical images reveal an emission nebula with\nvery rich morphological details, composed mainly of UV scattered light and of\nHalpha emission. Contrasting with the bright parts of the nebula, opaque,\nelongated patches are seen. Our optical photometry confirms that the\nilluminator of the nebula is likely to be a B0.5V star located at a distance of\nabout 3.2 kpc. Our near-IR images reveal an embedded cluster, extending for\nabout 2 pc and exhibiting sub-clustering: a denser, more condensed, sub-cluster\nsurrounding the optical high-mass B0.5V illuminator star; and a more embedded,\noptically invisible, sub-cluster located towards the eastern, dark part of the\nnebula and including the luminous MSX source G224.1880+01.2407, a massive\nprotostellar candidate that could be the origin of jets and extended features\nseen at 2.12 micron.

Most of these stars are also slow\nrotators compared to the normal A and B stars. Today, one of the greatest\nchallenges concerning the Ap/Bp stars is to understand the origin of their slow\nrotation and their magnetic fields. The favoured hypothesis for the latter is\nthat the fields are fosils, which implies that the magnetic fields subsist\nthroughout the different evolutionary phases, and in particular during the\npre-main sequence phase. The existence of magnetic fields at the pre-main\nsequence phase is also required to explain the slow rotation of Ap/Bp stars.\nDuring the last 3 years we performed a spectropolarimetric survey of the Herbig\nAe/Be stars in the field and in young clusters, in order to investigate their\nmagnetism and rotation. These investigations have resulted in the detection\nand/or confirmation of magnetic fields in 8 Herbig Ae/Be stars, ranging in mass\nfrom 2 to nearly 15 solar masses.

The central idea of the method is to avoid the\ncritical step involved in the regularization process, namely the explicit\nevaluation of divergent integrals. This goal is achieved by assuming a\nregularization distribution in an implicit way and making use, in intermediary\nsteps, only of very general properties of such regularization. The finite parts\nare separated of the divergent ones and integrated free from effects of the\nregularization. The divergent parts are organized in terms of standard objects\nwhich are independent of the (arbitrary) momenta running in internal lines of\nloop graphs. Through the analysis of symmetry relations, a set of properties\nfor the divergent objects are identified, which we denominate consistency\nrelations, reducing the number of divergent objects to only a few ones. The\ncalculational strategy eliminates unphysical dependencies of the arbitrary\nchoices for the routing of internal momenta, leading to ambiguity-free, and\nsymmetry-preserving physical amplitudes. We show that the imposition of scale\nproperties for the basic divergent objects leads to a critical condition for\nthe constituent quark mass such that the remaining arbitrariness is removed.\nThe model become predictive in the sense that its phenomenological consequences\ndo not depend on possible choices made in intermediary steps. Numerical results\nare obtained for physical quantities at the one-loop level for the pion and\nsigma masses and pion-quark and sigma-quark coupling constants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2008 20:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

These equations show that the satellite's\nsecular perturbations of the ring will excite a very long-wavelength spiral\ndensity wave that propagates away from the gap's outer edge. The amplitude of\nthese waves, as well as their dispersion relation, are derived here. That\ndispersion relation reveals that a planetary ring can sustain two types of\ndensity waves: long waves that, in Saturn's A ring, would have wavelengths of\norder 100 km, and short waves that tend to be very nonlinear and are expected\nto quickly damp. The excitation of these waves also transports angular momentum\nfrom the ring to the satellite in a way that damps the satellite's eccentricity\ne, which also tends to reduce the amplitude of subsequent waves. The rate of\neccentricity damping due to this wave action is then compared to the rates at\nwhich the satellite's Lindblad and corotation resonances alter the satellite's\ne. These results are then applied to the gap-embedded Saturnian satellites Pan\nand Daphnis, and the long-term stability of their eccentricities is assessed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2008 01:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The association of this with\nthe last stable orbit gives one of the few ways to estimate spin when the mass\nof the black hole is known. However, deriving this radius requires knowledge of\nhow the disk spectrum is modified by radiative transfer through the vertical\nstructure of the disk, as well as special and general relativistic effects on\nthe propagation of this radiation. Here we investigate the extent to which\ndifferences in vertical structure change the derived disk spectra by\ncalculating these for a range of different stress prescriptions. We find that\nat a given mass accretion rate the spectra are almost identical for accretion\nrates of L/L_Edd <~ 0.1. The spectra are remarkably similar even up to the\nhighest luminosities considered (L/L_Edd ~ 0.6) as long as the stresses do not\ndissipate more than about 10 per cent of the gravitational energy above the\neffective photosphere.

By using images with comparable angular resolution at five\nfrequencies obtained from the VLA archive and CARMA, we have removed the\nfree-free component from the 875 micron image. We find five sources of dust\nemission: two compact warm objects (SMA1 and SMA2) along the periphery of the\nshell, and three additional regions further out. There is no dust emission\ninside the shell, supporting the picture of a dust-free cavity surrounded by\nhigh density gas. At subarcsecond resolution, most of the molecular gas tracers\nencircle the UCHII region and appear to constrain its expansion. We also find\nG5.89-0.39 to be almost completely lacking in organic molecular line emission.\nThe dust cores SMA1 and SMA2 exhibit compact spatial peaks in optically-thin\ngas tracers (e.g. 34SO2), while SMA1 also coincides with 11.9 micron emission.\nIn CO(3-2), we find a high-velocity north/south bipolar outflow centered on\nSMA1, aligned with infrared H2 knots, and responsible for much of the maser\nactivity.

We describe the tensor correlations in 9Li\nfully in the tensor-optimized shell model, where the variation of the size\nparameters of the single particle orbits is essential for getting strong tensor\ncorrelations. We have shown in our previous study that in $^{10,11}$Li the\ntensor and pairing correlations in 9Li are Pauli-blocked by additional valence\nneutrons, which make the p-shell configurations pushed up in energy.

The concept of approximate eigenstructure is\nintroduced, which measures the accuracy E_p of the approximation of the channel\noperation as a pure multiplication in a given L_p-norm. Two variants of such an\napproximate Weyl symbol calculus are studied, which have important applications\nin several models for time--varying mobile channels. Typically, such channels\nhave random spreading functions (inverse Weyl transform) defined on a common\nsupport U of finite non--zero size such that approximate eigenstructure has to\nbe measured with respect to certain norms of the spreading process.

However, the\nquantum transition energy discontinuously depends upon the value of the filling\nfactor. This discontinuity yields energy gaps in many stable FQH states.

This paper\ngeneralizes the model, when only two stations accept arriving jobs, which was\nconsidered in [Ann. Appl. Probab. 17 (2007) 1447--1473]. Our results are stated\nin terms of Lyapunov exponents for random matrices. From the recurrence\ncriteria it can be seen that the polling model with parameter regeneration can\nexhibit the unusual phenomenon of null recurrence over a thick region of\nparameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2008 10:40:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2009 07:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-16"}

Application scenarios\ninclude data centers, peer-to-peer storage systems, and storage in wireless\nnetworks. Storing data using an erasure code, in fragments spread across nodes,\nrequires less redundancy than simple replication for the same level of\nreliability. However, since fragments must be periodically replaced as nodes\nfail, a key question is how to generate encoded fragments in a distributed way\nwhile transferring as little data as possible across the network.\n  For an erasure coded system, a common practice to repair from a node failure\nis for a new node to download subsets of data stored at a number of surviving\nnodes, reconstruct a lost coded block using the downloaded data, and store it\nat the new node. We show that this procedure is sub-optimal. We introduce the\nnotion of regenerating codes, which allow a new node to download\n\\emph{functions} of the stored data from the surviving nodes.

The most\nprominent result is the significant negative correlation between the\nsynchrotron peak frequencies and the synchrotron peak luminosities of the\nblazar population. Observational studies of the blazar sequence have, in\ngeneral, neglected the effect of Doppler boosting. We study the dependence of\nboth the synchrotron peak frequency and luminosity with Doppler-corrected\nquantities. We determine the spectral energy distributions of 135 radio-bright\nAGN and find the best-fit parabolic function for the distribution to quantify\ntheir synchrotron emission. The corresponding measurements of synchrotron peak\nluminosities and frequencies are Doppler-corrected with a new set of Doppler\nfactors calculated from variability data. The relevant correlations for the\nblazar sequence are determined for these intrinsic quantities. The Doppler\nfactor depends strongly on the synchrotron peak frequency, the lower energy\nsources being more boosted. Applying the Doppler correction to the peak\nfrequencies and luminosities annuls the negative correlation between the two\nquantities, which becomes positive. For BL Lacertae objects, the positive\ncorrelation is particularly strong. The blazar sequence, when defined as the\nanticorrelation between the peak frequency and luminosity of the synchrotron\ncomponent of the spectral energy distribution, disappears when the intrinsic,\nDoppler-corrected values are used.

The main bottleneck for such\nalgorithms, other than the obvious one of time, is the amount of memory used.\nIn the field of proof complexity, the resources of time and memory correspond\nto the length and space of resolution proofs. There has been a long line of\nresearch trying to understand these proof complexity measures, but while strong\nresults have been proven on length our understanding of space is still quite\npoor. For instance, it remains open whether the fact that a formula is provable\nin short length implies that it is also provable in small space or whether on\nthe contrary these measures are unrelated in the sense that short proofs can be\narbitrarily complex with respect to space.\n  In this paper, we present some evidence that the true answer should be that\nthe latter case holds. We do this by proving a tight bound of Theta(sqrt(n)) on\nthe space needed for so-called pebbling contradictions over pyramid graphs of\nsize n. This yields the first polynomial lower bound on space that is not a\nconsequence of a corresponding lower bound on width, another well-studied\nmeasure in resolution, as well as an improvement of the weak separation in\n(Nordstrom 2006) of space and width from logarithmic to polynomial.\n  Also, continuing the line of research initiated by (Ben-Sasson 2002) into\ntrade-offs between different proof complexity measures, we present a simplified\nproof of the recent length-space trade-off result in (Hertel and Pitassi 2007),\nand show how our ideas can be used to prove a couple of other exponential\ntrade-offs in resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2008 12:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

It suggests that the wavefunction of the universe is mobile in\nthe landscape until the universe reaches a meta-stable site with its\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda_0$ smaller than the critical value $\\Lambda_c$,\nwhere $\\Lambda_c$ is estimated to be exponentially small compared to the Planck\nscale. Since this site has an exponentially long lifetime, it may well be\ntoday's universe. We investigate specific scenarios based on this quantum\ndiffusion property of the cosmic landscape and find a plausible scenario for\nthe early universe. In the last fast tunneling to the $\\Lambda_0$\n($<\\Lambda_c$) site in this scenario, all energies are stored in the nucleation\nbubble walls, which are released to radiation only after bubble collisions and\nthermalization. So the $\\Lambda_0$ site is chosen even if $\\Lambda_0$ plus\nradiation is larger than $\\Lambda_c$, as long as the radiation does not\ndestabilize the $\\Lambda_0$ vacuum. A consequence is that inflation must happen\nbefore this last fast tunneling, so the inflationary scenario that emerges\nnaturally is extended brane inflation, where the brane motion includes a\ncombination of rolling, fast tunnelings, slow-roll, hopping and percolation in\nthe landscape. We point out that, in the brane world, radiation during\nnucleosynthesis are mostly on the standard model branes (brane radiation, as\nopposed to radiation in the bulk). This distinction may lead to interesting\ndynamics.

X-ray follow-up observations with Chandra were performed in 2007 with the\naim of identifying a synchrotron counterpart to the TeV source and/or thermal\nemission from the SNR shell. These new Chandra data, together with additional\nTeV data, allow us to investigate the nature of this object in much greater\ndetail than was previously possible. The new X-ray data reveal thermal emission\nfrom a ~4' region in close proximity to the radio shell of CTB 37B. The\ntemperature of this emission implies an age for the remnant of ~5000 years and\nan ambient gas density of ~0.5 cm-3. Both these estimates are considerably\nuncertain due to the asymmetry of the SNR and possible modifications of the\nkinematics due to efficient cosmic ray (CR) acceleration. A bright (~7x10-13erg\ncm-2s-1) and unresolved (<1'') source (CXOU J171405.7-381031) with a soft\n(\\Gamma ~3.3) non-thermal spectrum is also detected in coincidence with the\nradio shell. Absorption indicates a column density consistent with the thermal\nemission from the shell suggesting a genuine association rather than a chance\nalignment. The observed TeV morphology is consistent with an origin in the\ncomplete shell of CTB 37B. The lack of diffuse non-thermal X-ray emission\nsuggests an origin of the gamma-ray emission via the decay of neutral pions\nproduced in interactions of protons and nuclei, rather than inverse Compton\n(IC) emission from relativistic electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2008 15:39:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 May 2008 13:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
