This conclusion is based on low-resolution, near-infrared\nspectroscopy that reveals a subtle but distinctive absorption feature at 1.6\nmicron. The feature, which is also present in the combined light spectrum of\nthe M8.5 + T6 binary SCR 1845-6357, arises from the combination of FeH\nabsorption from an M8.5 primary and pseudo-continuum flux from a T5+/-1\nsecondary, as ascertained from binary spectral templates constructed from\nempirical data.

An ADAF is a poor radiator, and the ion temperature can approach\n10^{12} K near the center, although the electrons are cooler, with their\ntemperature typically capped at ~10^{9-11} K. The foundational papers predicted\nthat the large thermal energy in an ADAF would drive strong winds and jets, as\nlater observed and also confirmed in computer simulations. Of chief interest,\nhowever, is the accreting gas that races inward. It carries the bulk of the\naccretion energy as stored thermal energy, which vanishes without a trace as\nthe gas passes through the hole's event horizon. One thus expects black holes\nin the ADAF regime to be unusually faint. Indeed, this is confirmed by a\ncomparison of accreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, which\nreside in very similar transient X-ray binary systems. The black holes are on\naverage observed to be fainter by a factor of ~100-1000. The natural\nexplanation is that a neutron star must radiate the advected thermal energy\nfrom its surface, whereas a black hole can hide the energy behind its event\nhorizon. The case for an event horizon in Sagittarius A*, which is immune to\ncaveats on jet outflows and is furthermore independent of the ADAF model, is\nespecially compelling. These two lines of evidence for event horizons are\nimpervious to counterarguments that invoke strong gravity or exotic stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2008 21:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

The motivation comes\nfrom a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating\nquantum theories of space and time. In doing so we provide a new answer to\nHeidegger's timeless question ``What is a thing?''.\n  Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent\nto finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is\nattached to the system. Classical physics uses the topos of sets. Other\ntheories involve a different topos. For the types of theory discussed in this\npaper, a key goal is to represent any physical quantity $A$ with an arrow\n$\\breve{A}_\\phi:\\Si_\\phi\\map\\R_\\phi$ where $\\Si_\\phi$ and $\\R_\\phi$ are two\nspecial objects (the `state-object' and `quantity-value object') in the\nappropriate topos, $\\tau_\\phi$.\n  We discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system,\n$S$. The first, $\\PL{S}$, is a propositional language; the second, $\\L{S}$, is\na higher-order, typed language. Both languages provide deductive systems with\nan intuitionistic logic. With the aid of $\\PL{S}$ we expand and develop some of\nthe earlier work (By CJI and collaborators.) on topos theory and quantum\nphysics. A key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which a projection\noperator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf $\\Sig$--the topos\nquantum analogue of a classical state space. The topos concerned is $\\SetH{}$:\nthe category of contravariant set-valued functors on the category (partially\nordered set) $\\V{}$ of commutative sub-algebras of the algebra of bounded\noperators on the quantum Hilbert space $\\Hi$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2008 11:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In two previous papers we\nhave described the observations and discussed some dynamical aspects of the\nearlier phases of the flare, as well as the helium line formation in the active\nregion prior to the event. Here we extend the analysis of the helium line\nformation to the later phases of the flare in two different locations of the\nflaring area. We have devised a new technique, exploiting all available\ninformation from various SOHO instruments, to determine the spectral\ndistribution of the photoionizing EUV radiation produced by the corona\noverlying the two target regions. In order to find semiempirical models\nmatching all of our observables, we analyzed the effect on the calculated\nhelium spectrum both of A(He) (the He abundance) and of the uncertainties in\nthe incident EUV radiation (level and spectral distribution). We found that the\nabundance has in most cases (but not in all) a larger effect than the coronal\nback-radiation. The result of our analysis is that, considering the error of\nthe measured lines, and adopting our best estimate for the coronal EUV\nillumination, the value A(He)=0.075 +/- 0.010 in the chromosphere (for T>6300\nK) and transition region yields reasonably good matches for all the observed\nlines. This value is marginally consistent with the most commonly accepted\nphotospheric value: A(He)=0.085.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2008 12:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-30"}

The light curves of these\nstars exhibit multiple frequencies, and their spectra are similar. The latter\nare dominated by absorption/emission features produced in a circumstellar (CS)\nenvelope whereas photospheric features are barely visible and forbidden\nemission lines are not visible. Modeling of spectral features indicates similar\nphysical conditions for the CS envelope in both stars. An optically thick,\nslowly and thermally stratified disk. OGLE004633.76-731204.3 is noteworthy in\nshowing blue discrete absorption components (\"BACs\") in their spectra possibly\nindicating the shock interaction between high velocity and low velocity\nmaterial. Optical spectra from two spectra separated by 5 years show little\nchange in the radial velocity over this period. However because these\nobservations happen to be made in roughly similar phases over their long\nperiod, these suggest only that the stars are not in close binaries. We\ninterpret the occultations and additional photometric nearly periodic\nvariability in OGLE004633.76-731204.3 as due to covering of the star by a\ndensity modulation in a sector of a quasi-Keplerian circumstellar disk.\nAltogether, we suggest that these stars are prototypes of a larger group of\nstars, which we dub the \"bgBe's\" and discuss their similarities and differences\nwith respect to the well known sgB[e] variables.

Recent developments in\nelectrophysiology and imaging allow one to simultaneously record activities of\nhundreds of neurons. Inferring the underlying neuronal connectivity patterns\nfrom such multi-neuronal spike train data streams is a challenging statistical\nand computational problem. This task involves finding significant temporal\npatterns from vast amounts of symbolic time series data. In this paper we show\nthat the frequent episode mining methods from the field of temporal data mining\ncan be very useful in this context. In the frequent episode discovery\nframework, the data is viewed as a sequence of events, each of which is\ncharacterized by an event type and its time of occurrence and episodes are\ncertain types of temporal patterns in such data. Here we show that, using the\nset of discovered frequent episodes from multi-neuronal data, one can infer\ndifferent types of connectivity patterns in the neural system that generated\nit. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of mining for frequent episodes\nunder certain temporal constraints; the structure of these temporal constraints\nis motivated by the application. We present algorithms for discovering serial\nand parallel episodes under these temporal constraints. Through extensive\nsimulation studies we demonstrate that these methods are useful for unearthing\npatterns of neuronal network connectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2008 14:11:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2008 02:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-11"}

This potential is\ninterpreted as representing the dispersion of the linear equation. The model is\nbased on de Broglie's original wave-particle concept, which is based on the\nSpecial theory of relativity. The model thus illustrates that theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2008 14:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-05"}

The (001) substrates of MgO, STO\nand LAO provide different degree of epitaxial strain for growth of the\ndisordered face centered cubic (fcc) and ordered face centered tetragonal\n(L1_0) phases of CoPt. The films deposited at T_d~600 ^0C on all three\nsubstrates are fcc with in-plane magnetization and a narrow hysteresis loop of\nwidth~200 Oe. The L1_0 phase, stabilized only at T_d~700 ^0C becomes\npredominantly c-axis oriented as T_d is increased to 800 ^0C. While the\ncrystallographic structure of the films depends solely on the T_d, their\nmicrostructure and magnetization characteristics are decided by the growth\nrate. At the higher G_r (~1A/sec) the L1_0 films have a maze-like structure\nwhich converts to a continuous film as the t_F is increased from 20 to 50 nm.\nThe H_c of these films increases as the L1_0 phase fraction grows with T_d and\nits orientation becomes out of the film plane. The evolution of microstructure\nwith T_d is remarkably different at lower growth rate (~0.4A /sec). Here the\nstructure changes from a self-similar fractal pattern to an assembly of\nnano-dots as the T_d is raised from 700 to 800 ^0C, and is understood in terms\nof the imbalance between strain and interfacial energies. MFM of such films\nreveals no distinct domain walls within the nano-islands while a clear contrast\nis seen between the islands of reversed magnetization. The simple picture of\ncoherent rotation of moment appears incompatible with the time dependence of\nthe remanent magnetization in these films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2008 15:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Optical data for the sources\ncomes from the Subaru-XMM Deep Field (SXDF) and mid- and far-IR fluxes from\nSWIRE. We obtain photometric redshift estimates for our sources using optical\nand IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 micron fluxes. We then fit spectral energy distribution\n(SED) templates to the longer wavelength data to determine the nature of the\nfar-IR emission that dominates the bolometric luminosity of these sources. The\ninfrared template fits are also used to resolve ambiguous identifications and\ncases of redshift aliasing. The redshift distribution obtained broadly matches\nprevious results for submm sources and on the SHADES SXDF field. Our template\nfitting finds that AGN, present in about 10% of sources, do not contribute\nsignificantly to their bolometric luminosity. Dust heating by starbursts, with\neither Arp220 or M82 type SEDs, appears to be responsible for the luminosity in\nmost sources (23/33 are fitted by Arp220 templates, 2/33 by the warmer M82\ntemplates). 8/33 sources, in contrast, are fit by a cooler cirrus dust\ntemplate, suggesting that cold dust has a role in some of these highly luminous\nobjects. Three of our sources appear to have multiple identifications or\ncomponents at the same redshift, but we find no statistical evidence that close\nassociations are common among our SHADES sources. Examination of rest-frame K\n-band luminosity suggests that 'downsizing' is underway in the submm galaxy\npopulation, with lower redshift systems lying in lower mass host galaxies. Of\nour 33 identifications six are found to be of lower reliability but their\nexclusion would not significantly alter our conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2008 15:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
