These characteristics do not change when the particles\ninteract with other particles or fields as long as they preserve their\nentities. Quantum theory does not explain this quantization. It is introduced\ninto the theory a priori. An interacting particle is an open system and thus\ndoes not obey conservation laws. However, an open system may create dynamically\nstable states with unchanged dynamical variables via self-organization. In\nself-organized systems stability is achieved through the interplay of\nnonlinearity and dissipation. Can self-organization be responsible for particle\nformation? In this paper we develop and analyze a particle model based on\nqualitative dynamics and the Feigenbaum universality. This model demonstrates\nthat elementary particles can be described as self-organized dynamical systems\nbelonging to a wide class of systems characterized by a hierarchy of\nperiod-doubling bifurcations. This semi-qualitative heuristic model gives\npossible explanations for charge and action quantization, and the origination\nand interrelation between the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces, as well\nas SU(2) symmetry. It also provides a basis for particle taxonomy endorsed by\nthe Standard Model.

The motion of the nuclear surface is\ndescribed by means of a collective variable which appears explicitly in the\nHamiltonian as an additional degree of freedom. The total energy of the system\nis therefore conserved. Although the particles do not directly interact with\neach other, their motions are indirectly coupled by means of their interaction\nwith the moving nuclear surface. We consider as free parameters in this model\nthe degree of collectivity and the fraction of nucleons that participate to the\ndecay of the collective excitation.

We observe a dynamic crossover in\nthe temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time for all glycols,\nconsistent with the common behavior of most supercooled liquids. We find that\nthe crossover becomes more pronounced for increasing hydrogen bond\nconcentrations, which leads to the prediction of a marked dynamic transition\nfor water within 'no man's land' at T~220 K. Interestingly, the predicted\ntransition thus takes place at a temperature where a so called 'strong-fragile'\ntransition has previously been suggested. Our results, however, imply that the\ndynamic transition of supercooled water is analogous to that commonly observed\nin supercooled liquids.

The action is invariant\nunder additional symmetries in comparison to the supermembrane on a 11D\nMinkowski target space. The hamiltonian in the LCG is invariant under conformal\ntransformations on the Riemann surface base manifold. The spectrum of the\nregularized hamiltonian is discrete with finite multiplicity. Its resolvent is\ncompact. Susy is spontaneously broken, due to the topological central charge\ncondition, to four supersymmetries in 4D, the vacuum belongs to an N=1\nsupermultiplet. When assuming the target-space to be an isotropic 7-tori, the\npotential does not contain any flat direction, it is stable on the moduli space\nof parameters. Moreover due to the discrete symmetries of the hamiltonian,\nthere are only 7 possible minimal holomorphic immersions of the MIM2 on the\n7-torus. When these symmetries are identified on the target space, it\ncorresponds to compactify the MIM2 on a orbifold with G2 structure. Once the\nsingularities are resolved it leads to the compactification of the MIM2 on a G2\nmanifold as shown in [2].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2008 10:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
